  "text": "I don't know if you knew this about me, but I'm only about 5 feet, 2 inches tall, (or should I say 5 feet small?) so shopping can be tricky sometimes. Over the years, I've discovered some shopping tricks that make finding clothes for shorter people much easier, so today I wanted to share my favorite three shopping tricks for petites!\n\n\n\n1. Accept that most things will have to be tailored.\n\n\n\nThe first step to successfully shopping for a petite frame is just accepting the fact that most things will have to be altered. The average height for women is 5 feet, 4 inches to 5 feet, 6 inches, so most clothing is not made for petite people; therefore, clothing needs to be adjusted to fit your body.\n\n\n\nA good tailor will be able to immediately see where clothing should be adjusted to best fit and flatter your frame. It's always a good idea to find a tailor that you like and establish a relationship with them, as that will make tailoring clothing easier long term, and they will begin to learn how you like your clothing to fit.\n\n\n\nIf you're getting a lot of clothing altered, it's a good idea to look into alterations programs at some retail stores or find a tailor near you. For example, I googled tailors in my area and came across one with great reviews. Taking my items to a local tailor has been so great, because I know my garments will now fit my frame perfectly. Having a professional available to hem a long dress or pants or whatever alterations you may need will make your clothing look that much better on you. It's a worthy investment that pays off in the long run.\n\n\n\n2. Cropped pants are your best friend.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to shopping tricks for petites, going for cropped pants is one of the best options. Even if there's no petite section, cropped pants will often work really well on a petite frame. Most of the time if I can find a pair of cropped or ankle pants, they will be the perfect full length pant for me with no alterations needed! I call this a win! Sometimes petite crop pants even work as full length pants on me depending on the inseam length, but you'll just have to test out the waters and see what works best for you.\n\n\n\nSide note: Cropped pants often go on sale in fall and winter because they're leftover from spring and summer clothing lines, so look for seasonal sales and swoop up all the cropped styles you can!\n\n\n\n3. There are some really good petite sections out there.\n\n\n\nWhile a lot of clothing still needs to be altered, there are some really good petite sections out there. Nordstrom has a great petite section, and so does Banana Republic. I'm also finding that a lot more stores are offering pants in \"short\" length. I recently even found shorter pants at Target! Generally, Zara and H&M work well for petite frames. Because they are international brands, they cater to a wider range of heights for women.\n\n\n\n(Whether she's dishing out advice on how to wear the latest trends or putting fun looks together, fashion writer and stylist Aramide Esubi is always on the move keeping up with the latest in fashion.

  "text": "When race car development has been in your blood since 1901, you\u2019re allowed to be picky with who, what, when, where, and how your performance badge is worn. Just ask Henry Ford about a vehicle named Sweepstakes. Although Ford raced only once, and only with that car, it was a win nonetheless. And thanks to some notoriety (and winner\u2019s circle cash money) eventually the Ford Motor Company was born.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of history, and today\u2019s Ford Performance vehicles include GT, Shelby, and even Raptor\u2014nameplates that either punch you in the gut with performance or in the face with ballsy attitude. Heck, maybe both if you\u2019re lucky. Even the automaker\u2019s small cars (Fiesta, Focus) can serve up bold capabilities beyond their sheet metal serving size.\n\nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n\nThe new 2019 Ford Edge ST is the automaker\u2019s first-ever Ford Performance-tuned crossover or SUV, and it certainly drives in the manner to which its hot-to-trot badging suggests. (Beverly Braga)\n\nSo, what\u2019s next in the lineup to receive a sport-tuned makeover? The 2019 Ford Edge, of course! As the first-ever crossover/SUV to wear the Ford Performance team\u2019s ST badge, the why is a no-brainer. Because let\u2019s be honest, the automotive landscape has changed, and sales now veer toward utility vehicles. Besides, there must be a market\u2014no matter how niche\u2014for performance \u2018utes when even three-rowers like the Hemi V8-powered, 475-horsepower Dodge Durango SRT exist.\n\nThe new Edge ST is part of the model\u2019s 2019 refresh, replacing the Edge Sport in the lineup. Like the outgoing Sport, however, the new ST features a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 and is only paired with all-wheel drive. Unlike the Sport, though, the ST receives a new 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters as standard. But don\u2019t use them.\n\nClearly performance-tuned\n\nUnlike the rest of the Edge lineup, the ST model is equipped with paddle shifters. Downshifts are rev-matched but upshifts take too long to happen. Instead, let the new 8-speed automatic do the work for you. (Beverly Braga)\n\nThe automatic is plenty good with well-ratioed shift points. The paddle shifters, on the other hand, are okay on downshifts but take about two seconds to upshift. And that\u2019s terrible because by the time you\u2019re in the gear you wanted, the moment you needed it for has passed. This was a surprising disappointment.\n\nThe specially tuned V6 does pump out 20 more horses to 335 and 30 more lb.-ft. of torque to 350. Even so, fuel economy has increased to an EPA-rated 19 mpg in the city mpg, 26 mpg on the highway, and 21 mpg in combined driving. Drive it like you stole it, and the Edge ST does zero-to-60 mph in less than 6 seconds. Comparatively, the 3.0-liter V6 Porsche Macan S takes 5.2 seconds to hustle to 60 mph with its 340 hp, but it will also cost you at least $56,450.\n\nThe Edge ST starts at $43,350 (including $995 destination) and tops out at around $55,000. My test vehicle, a White Platinum Edge ST, amounted to a well-equipped $52,225, which included the ST Performance Brake Package. This added front and rear vented brakes with 13.6-inch front rotors, fade-resistant brake pads, red-painted calipers, and 21-inch gloss black wheels with summer tires.\n\nFrom a ride and handling standpoint, man, is the Edge ST stiff. The standard all-wheel-drive system (which features a \u201cdisconnect\u201d that allows drivers to switch to front-wheel drive for fuel economy savings) certainly keeps the 4,081-pound crossover planted in fast corners, and Sport mode is even more so in the ST compared to the rest of the Edge models.\n\nHowever, without active damping, the ST-tuned sport suspension can make for a harsh ride, which becomes even more apparent when equipped with the larger wheel set and performance tires. Parking lot entry/exit points, for example, felt unintentionally off-roadish. For most crossover consumers, a refined ride is preferred, but the Edge ST wasn\u2019t engineered to be subtle.\n\nBuilt for parenting in the fast lane\n\nIf the ST and Ford Performance badging weren\u2019t giveaways, then perhaps the bright red-painted brake calipers provide the hint that this isn\u2019t your typical Ford Edge. (Beverly Braga)\n\nWhere the ST shines is in the crosshairs of speed and precision. Highway merges, passing lanes, sweeping mountain roads, or sketchy canyons\u2014you name it and the Edge ST will hold its own. Its rascal manner can make even the most routine errand a little less mundane. Case in point, an autocross course befitting the frantic parent life.\n\nFord set up a short road course during its Edge media event but with one caveat: Not only were the standard competition rules in place (no cone hitting, no going off course), participants also were required to load three large boxes into the vehicle cargo hold. No putting the rear seats down, no forgetting a box, and your seat belt fastened, of course. Otherwise, time penalties upon time penalties.\n\nNo one in our group cleanly drove without breaking the one-minute mark, but there was an appreciation for the repeated ingress-egress parents must face with kids, pets, groceries, and whatever else makes its way into their daily grind. But if you know how to hit your unlock buttons just right, you can do even that with ST quickness.\n\nThe 2019 Ford Edge ST is not for everyone, and it\u2019s not marketed that way. Yet for those who do need a vehicle from the doldrums of the crossover segment, the new Edge ST offers a sharp non-luxury alternative to the dull butter knives that comprise much of the class.\n\nFirst Pictures: 2019 Ford Edge ST\n\nSign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!\n\nDid you find this article helpful?

  "text": "The Toyota Corolla has been around for a long time \u2013 more than 50 years. Along with maintaining its well-deserved reputation for reliability and value, Toyota has kept it up to date in other ways, too. That's why the Corolla has consistently been one of the top-selling cars in the world for decades.\n\nBuilt on the Toyota New Global Architecture platform that underpins everything from the Toyota Prius to the Lexus UX, the redesigned 2019 Corolla gets a dramatic new styling treatment as well, including a prominent grille plastered across its face like a toothy grin and lots of sporty-looking body sculpting.\n\nFIRST LOOK: 2019 TOYOTA COROLLA HATCHBACK\n\nLong known for dowdy styling, the 2019 Corolla Hatchback has a fresh new look that is sure to set it apart. (Benjamin Preston)\n\nThe front end may not be to your taste, but the car's proportions and its sleek rear quarters are well thought-out. Like it or not, Toyota's edgy new design language is eye-catching in a way it hasn't been since the Corolla\u2019s inception in the mid-'60s. Superficially, boring has been wiped away from the small Toyota.\n\nThe Corolla Hatchback \u2013 a replacement for the Corolla iM \u2013 faces tough competition, though. It goes t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with sportier, more spacious, and often cheaper 4-door hatchbacks like the Volkswagen Golf, Honda Civic, and the Mazda 3.\n\nThe big question is whether or not the Corolla has what it takes to lure buyers away from the Civic, with which it has always shared a rivalry and which led sales by more than 50,000 units last year. At a time when small crossovers are absorbing sales from small cars, a hatchback like the Corolla must distinguish itself to get noticed.\n\nElusive roominess\n\nThe 2019 Corolla's seats are a bit hard, and its interior on the small side. (Benjamin Preston)\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the Corolla Hatchback's interior is that it feels inordinately small. I'm not a large man, but I have a wife and a child, and they can take up quite a bit of space when combined with the trappings they require during travel.\n\nWith the child safety seat installed, my wife was unable to sit with her knees straight in the front passenger seat. The lack of front-seat legroom could have been less of an issue if the lower dashboard was flatter. As it is, the dash juts out into and invades the passenger space. From a design perspective, perhaps the intrusive dash was a structural necessity. If it was a stylistic choice, it wasn't a practical one.\n\nFortunately, the rear doors are slightly larger from side to side than those on the Honda Civic. That meant easier rear-seat access in the Corolla, which made for relatively smooth child safety seat installation.\n\nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n\nCargo space is minimal for a car of the Corolla's cohort, although room in the Corolla is slightly more generous than the Golf. With the rear seats up, there's just under 18 cu.-ft. of cargo volume. It's enough to carry a large stroller or a week's worth of groceries, but not both. By contrast, the Mazda 3 hatchback boasts more than 20 cu.-ft. of behind-the-seat cargo volume and the Civic hatch a cavernous 26 cu.-ft. (it puts many small crossovers to shame).\n\nWith the rear seats down, the Corolla's cargo space jumps to only 23 cu.-ft. \u2013 less than half what's offered on the Mazda 3, Civic, and Golf. To make matters worse, the cargo opening is small and the load floor high, making it difficult to fit bulky items inside the car.\n\nIn this age of expected creature comforts, I was surprised to find that the Corolla's seats are a little hard. A lumbar control and power adjustability in the XSE model I tested helped, but on a drive of over two hours, it felt good to get out of the car and leave its uncomfortable seat behind.\n\nBut for all that, the interior was pleasantly spare. The infotainment screen was big and crisp, and the dash layout simple and clean. The lines Toyota used on the seats suggested playfulness, but didn't delve into silliness. Its exterior may be fun, but inside, the Corolla is all business.\n\nSimplicity within\n\nThe 2019 Corolla Hatchback's controls are uncluttered and easy to use. (Benjamin Preston)\n\nThe Toyota Corolla hatchback\u2019s interior controls are straightforward and the instrument cluster displays are easy to manipulate with buttons located on the steering wheel. Simplicity is key; there are no buttons on the dashboard that anyone really needs. That could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending upon the driver's preference. But simplicity is what has defined this nameplate for decades, and Toyota is sticking to that tried and true formula.\n\nThere are no gimmicks with the car's familiar automatic transmission shifter, and the climate control system contains few, if any, surprises. The audio system has knobs \u2013 a dead horse issue I feel hasn't been flogged to death yet. It's good to have knobs in case you don't feel like messing around with menus and steering wheel buttons while you're driving. So thanks for that, Toyota.\n\nToyota generously doles out active safety features for the Corolla, regardless of trim. Pre-collision braking with pedestrian detection, lane-tracing assist, lane-departure alert with steering assist, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control are all standard features. Blind spot monitoring is optional on the base-level SE trim (albeit only with a continuously variable transmission). It comes standard on the XSE.\n\nIn tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Toyota Corolla Hatchback aced everything except headlight performance, resulting in a \u201cTop Safety Pick\u201d rating.\n\nPower, au naturel\n\nToyota has held onto its naturally aspirated engines as other manufacturers have adopted forced induction to increase power and efficiency. (Benjamin Preston)\n\nKudos to Toyota for hanging on to naturally aspirated engines. It does them well. The front-wheel-drive Corolla hatch comes with a 168-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that delivers solid fuel economy and decent acceleration. Unfortunately, you have to wait until the engine winds up to 4,800 rpm to reach peak torque, and 6,600 rpm to realize its full horsepower potential.\n\nWhat that means in practice is that stomping the go pedal to the floor creates a buzzy drone that doesn't really compel the car to move in an overly sporty manner. It's OK \u2013 not at all bad. The engine works well when you're already at speed. But it's not great at moving the car's nearly 3,100-lb. bulk quickly away from a position of rest. The turbocharged engines many other manufacturers are leaning on for their small-displacement engines do a better job of delivering the goods to drivers looking for seat-of-the-pants driving fun.\n\nI haven't had a chance to drive the 6-speed manual version of this car, but I've heard good things. The Corolla's new Dynamic Shift CVT works better than those in most cars thanks to a physical gear that helps to launch the car, but it really doesn't do much to work around the engine's limitations. If you\u2019re so inclined, you can engage in a semblance of shifting aided by a pair of gear-selector paddles mounted ever-so-sportily on the steering wheel.\n\nThe car handles and stops well, thanks in no small part to its tidy dimensions and the 15-inch brake rotors mounted at all four corners. The electric steering is responsive, if a bit wooden with regards to road feel. But Toyota's secret weapon is called active cornering assist, a computer aided system that controls braking and drive output to counter the effects of understeer often felt during hard cornering.\n\nLimitations aside, the little Corolla hatch is fun to drive when small size and nimble handling give the driver an edge over slower-moving traffic. Where the Corolla hatchback really shines, though, is in the fuel economy department. Among similarly equipped versions of the Civic Sport, Mazda 3, and the VW Golf, the Corolla hatch has the highest EPA fuel economy rating.\n\nOn my test loop, I got 34 miles per gallon, which is a little higher than the EPA's combined city-highway average.\n\nSemper valorem\n\nFor good reason, Toyota has sold millions of Corollas around the world over the past five decades. (Benjamin Preston)\n\nMy first car was a 1983 Toyota Corolla wagon. It was utilitarian, fuel efficient, and inexpensive when my grandfather had purchased it new 13 years earlier. But it wasn't pretty in the way today's Toyotas are. Even if you're not a fan of Toyota's new styling direction, you have to admit that, at long last, it has pizazz.\n\nWith its good looks, great fuel economy, and list of standard safety features, the Corolla hatchback makes a compelling case that it should be picked over its competition. At the end of the day, how much \"fun\" driving are you really going to be able to do along your daily slog between home, work, the grocery store, and the myriad appointments you're obligated to keep? This car offers good value and has a well-earned reputation as something that will provide many years of trouble-free service.\n\nFor most people, the Corolla hatchback's combination of fun hot-hatch styling and practicality are likely to win them over in the end.\n\nFirst Pictures: 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback\n\nSign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!\n\nDid you find this article helpful?

  "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/street-smarts/8-great-traits-2019-subaru-forester-list-article-1.4043555",
  "text": "Crossovers are the useful offspring of SUVs and sedans, and the Subaru Forester was one of the first when it debuted in 1998. As with more recent models, the earliest Forester crossover paired SUV-style ruggedness with a car-based platform that delivered smooth handling on paved streets.\n\nThis Subaru has evolved in the 20-plus years that it\u2019s been on the market. For 2019, the Forester enters its fifth generation with a redesign that boosts its capabilities in a host of areas.\n\nFIRST LOOK: 2019 SUBARU FORESTER\n\nThe new Forester is more spacious than its predecessor in many ways. Its wheelbase has grown from 103.9 to 105.1 inches, and this facilitates a 1.4-inch increase in rear-seat legroom. The Forester\u2019s cabin also benefits from improved headroom and shoulder room, and this gives it a more open feeling overall. The door openings are wider, and this makes it easier to enter and exit the vehicle, or install a child seat.\n\nIn back, the Forester\u2019s maximum cargo capacity has grown by 1.4 cu.-ft. And the tailgate opening is 5.3 inches wider than the previous model\u2019s, for easier access to cargo.\n\nThe new Forester is offered with an expanded range of comfort, convenience, and tech amenities. All models are motivated by a 2.5-liter engine that provides 182 horsepower and 176 lb.-ft. of torque, and gears are shifted by a continuously variable transmission (CVT).\n\nThis redesign adds modern features and ushers in changes that boost the Forester\u2019s utility, and these upgrades make it an even stronger choice in its segment. Still, this model doesn\u2019t shine in all areas.\n\nBelow, we take a look at eight great traits of the 2019 Forester... along with a shortcoming you should keep in mind before making this Subaru your next compact crossover SUV.\n\n#1: Relatively high ground clearance\n\nWith a tall 8.7 inches of ground clearance, the Forester is a great choice for off-roading. (Subaru)\n\nOff-roading can give you a chance to experience the best Mother Nature has to offer, and to properly equip yourself for the adventure, you need a vehicle suited for the task. One essential attribute is high ground clearance. This helps your vehicle to safely clear fallen tree branches or boulders should they happen to litter your path.\n\nThe Forester impresses in this area, offering a healthy 8.7 inches of ground clearance. That\u2019s enough to easily tackle many off-roading scenarios, and it\u2019s a lot more than you\u2019ll get from most choices in this segment. For example, with the 2019 Kia Sportage, ground clearance tops out at just 6.8 inches.\n\n#2: Standard all-wheel drive\n\nStandard all-wheel drive gives the Forester better traction on snowy roads. (Subaru)\n\nMany budget-conscious car shoppers seek out base models for their affordability. However, if you\u2019re a shopper who needs all-wheel drive (AWD) for travels in rain and snow, including this feature can add a thousand or so dollars to a vehicle\u2019s base price. That kind of extra investment can be discouraging if your finances are tight.\n\nFor this reason, it\u2019s great to know that the Forester includes AWD as standard equipment on all models. The Forester\u2019s AWD system can help make your commute safer by providing added traction on roads that are slick with rain or ice. It also gives the vehicle improved grip in off-road situations.\n\n#3: User-friendly cargo area\n\nThe Forester\u2019s cargo area is roomy and has an unusually wide tailgate opening. (Subaru)\n\nThere are a couple of factors that go into making a vehicle\u2019s cargo area user-friendly. The first consideration is cargo capacity. The space has to be roomy enough to handle your groceries or luggage. Next, it\u2019s important to take a look at how the cargo area is designed. The wider the opening, the better, since this will make it easier to load and unload your belongings.\n\nSubaru\u2019s Forester provides up to 35.4 cu.-ft. of cargo space with its rear seats in place and up to 76.1 cu.-ft. with those seats lowered. That makes it much roomier than rivals like the 2019 Kia Sportage, which provides 30.7 cu.-ft. behind the second row and 60.1 cu.-ft. behind the first.\n\nAlso, the Forester\u2019s cargo space is designed for easy access. Measuring in at a cavernous 51.2 inches, its tailgate opening is one of the widest in the segment.\n\n#4: Broad range of standard driver-assist features\n\nA forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking is one of the Forester\u2019s standard driver-assist features. (Subaru)\n\nAccording to the National Transportation Safety Board, nearly half of all two-vehicle crashes between 2012 and 2014 were rear-end collisions. In each of these years, these crashes killed more than 1,700 people.\n\nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n\nA forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking can help prevent these collisions, and this feature is standard on the Forester. This system uses sensors to gauge the distance of the car ahead, and, if necessary, automatically applies the brakes to prevent a collision. If, for example, the car in front of you were to suddenly slow down, this technology would be able to issue an alert and automatically brake the vehicle if you are slow to respond.\n\nThe Forester also comes standard with amenities such as adaptive cruise control, a lane-departure warning system, and a lane-keeping assist system.\n\n#5: State-of-the-art drowsy driver monitoring system\n\nThe Forester\u2019s drowsy driver monitoring system uses cutting-edge facial recognition technology to let you know if you\u2019re driving while fatigued. (Subaru)\n\nHave you ever found yourself nodding off during a lengthy commute? A drowsy driver monitoring system can provide invaluable assistance in situations like this. This feature is able to tell whether you\u2019re driving while fatigued or distracted, and it lets you know when it\u2019s time for a coffee break.\n\nSubaru calls its drowsy driver monitoring system DriverFocus, and it\u2019s standard on the Forester\u2019s top trim level. Other models in this class offer systems that let you know if you\u2019re driving while fatigued, but Subaru claims its feature is the first in the segment to employ precise, leading-edge facial recognition technology. DriverFocus is able to recognize up to five drivers.\n\n#6: Excellent fuel economy\n\nFuel efficiency is one of the Forester\u2019s strengths, and it gets 26/33 mpg city/highway. (Subaru)\n\nA car with excellent fuel economy can save you money, but that\u2019s not the only benefit: Fuel-efficient vehicles also do a service to the environment. The EPA reports that vehicles traveling on the highway release roughly 1.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year. The more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the lower its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe Forester scores high marks for fuel efficiency. According to the EPA, it achieves 26/33 mpg city/highway. This give it better fuel economy than rivals such as the 2018 Ford Escape, which gets mileage of up to 23/30 mpg. The Forester\u2019s mileage is even more impressive when you consider that it comes with standard AWD, a feature that can diminish gas mileage.\n\n#7: Tremendous value\n\nAffordably priced and loaded with content, the Forester offers superb value. (Subaru)\n\nBudget-conscious car shoppers often choose compact and subcompact vehicles for their modest price tags. This is a wise choice, and when you consider how much small vehicles have grown in size over the years, it\u2019s a decision that comes with few compromises. Today\u2019s compact vehicles are yesterday\u2019s midsize models.\n\nStarting at $24,295, the Forester is competitively priced. It comes standard with a respectable list of comfort and convenience features, including automatic LED headlights and power-adjustable exterior mirrors. And, as mentioned previously, all models are equipped with a robust range of driver-assist amenities.\n\nOffering a broad range of standard features, excellent all-around quality, and an accessible price tag, the 2019 Subaru Forester makes a strong case when it comes to value.\n\n#8: Up-to-date range of tech features\n\nThe Forester\u2019s range of tech features includes satellite radio. (Subaru)\n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever traveled on a long road trip appreciates the value of satellite radio. As you\u2019re driving from one town or state to the next, local radio stations can vary, and signals can fade. Regardless of how long your trip is and how many states you drive through, satellite radio ensures you\u2019ll always have access to the same range of stations.\n\nSatellite radio is one of the standard features on the 2019 Forester. The list also includes Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone projection technology, a 6.5-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, a 4-speaker sound system, a single-disc CD player, iHeart Radio, and a Magellan navigation app.\n\nOptional equipment includes an 8-inch touchscreen, hands-free text messaging, and a 9-speaker Harman Kardon sound system.\n\nA fatal flaw\n\nThere was a time when the only SUVs with respectable tow ratings were those that were midsize or larger. These days, the picture has changed, and there are small SUVs that deliver strong towing capabilities.\n\nUnfortunately, the Forester isn\u2019t a leader in this respect, and it comes with a mediocre tow rating. This Subaru can pull up to 1,500 pounds; other choices in this segment can tow much heavier loads. For example, when properly equipped, the Ford Escape can tow up to 3,500 lbs.\n\nIf you\u2019re seeking a small crossover that offers exceptional towing capacity, it\u2019s a good idea to look at the Escape and a couple of the Forester\u2019s other rivals.\n\nThe civilized outdoorsman\n\nThe Subaru Forester was one of the first compact crossovers, and it continues to be one of the best. (Subaru)\n\nWith its high ground clearance and standard AWD, the Forester is equipped to hold its own when your travels take you off the paved path. It also comes with modern tech and driver-assist features, and these amenities make it an agreeable companion in urban and suburban commutes. Additionally, the Forester offers a cargo area that\u2019s spacious and thoughtfully designed.\n\nDecades ago, the Forester was one of the first small crossovers to hit the market. The 2019 Forester proves this Subaru has only gotten better with time.\n\nFirst Pictures: 2019 Subaru Forester\n\nSign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!\n\nDid you find this article helpful?

  "text": "With a passing glance, the 2019 Ford Edge would appear no different from its 2018 counterpart, especially in profile. But as mid-life vehicle refreshes go, there is more than meets the eye.\n\nUnder the hood, the new 2019 Edge drops its 3.5-liter V6 in favor of a standard turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine as standard equipment for the SE, SEL, and Titanium trim levels. The powertrain is also now mated to a new, Ford-first, 8-speed automatic transmission instead of the previous 6-speed.\n\nFIRST LOOK: 2019 FORD EDGE\n\nThe 2019 Ford Edge is a mild mid-cycle update featuring new drivetrains, a restyled exterior, and more standard safety technology. (Beverly Braga)\n\nThe Sport trim level is discontinued, but is replaced with the all-new Edge ST, marking the first time a crossover or SUV has been tuned by the Ford Performance team. Sweet! A corporate gag order won\u2019t allow me to talk about it and its specially-tuned 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 engine until October 9, 2018, though. Sigh. Guess you\u2019ll just have to come back.\n\nCapable climber\n\nChanges are least noticeable when viewing the 2019 Ford Edge in profile, unless you\u2019re a stickler for wheel designs. (Beverly Braga)\n\nIn the meantime, I did take a well-equipped, early-production Edge Titanium front-wheel-drive model for a spin through the Wasatch Back region of Utah, which passes through high-elevation cities like Winter Olympian-friendly Park City.\n\nAll-wheel drive wasn\u2019t necessary during the dry, sunny morning, but even FWD with winter tires would prove inadequate once winter dumps deep snow upon the region\u2019s mountain switchbacks and blind curves. But the new drivetrain proved itself capable enough as summer transitioned to fall.\n\nThe 2019 pairing produces 250 horsepower and 280 lb.-ft. of torque, a plus-five increase to both figures. Making this engine standard also improves the Edge\u2019s fuel economy ratings from 20 mpg in combined driving with the V6 (FWD and AWD) to 25 mpg (FWD) and 23 mpg (AWD) with the 4-banger.\n\nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n\nSurprisingly, given the new 8-speed automatic, fuel economy sees little improvement over last year\u2019s optional turbo four. With FWD, the number rises from 24 mpg in combined driving to 25 mpg. With AWD, the rating for combined driving remains the same at 23 mpg.\n\nAt altitude in Utah, the turbocharged 2.0-liter audibly expressed its effort during hill climbs, but the engine note was hardly a panting whine. The new transmission worked just fine as well. Sport mode adjusts throttle response and shift points but doesn\u2019t change steering feel, which I would have appreciated in quick corners. In Sport mode the engine also bellowed louder than I preferred, so I deferred to the Normal drive mode through some of the mountain passes.\n\nThe Ford Edge boasts a rather firm ride, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an uncomfortable one. Although the Edge felt a tad floaty in some corners, the vehicle was generally more composed than others in the midsize crossover class and the suspension was plenty absorbent over gravelly terrain and road bumps.\n\nMore style but weird ergonomics\n\nErgonomics are a bit wonky with a higher than average seat height and awkwardly angled steering wheel, but at least the leather-trimmed seats themselves are comfortable. (Beverly Braga)\n\nAdmittedly, the bolsters will feel less than ideal for narrower body types, but the leather-trimmed seats in my test car were plush and accommodating.\n\nI will say the seating position seemed too high with the steering wheel awkwardly angled. In fact, to my small self, the driving position was not unlike that of a bus\u2014but with worse visibility. Also, if you\u2019re petite like me or prefer to sit closer to the dashboard, the thick windshield pillars produce unwelcome blind spots, especially when turning.\n\nStyling wise, the 2019 Edge receives redesigns to the front fascia, hood, grille, rear liftgate, and wheels. Standard equipment includes LED headlights and taillights, and new exterior colors debut. Although the changes are slight, the Edge still gives off an appealing sporty vibe.\n\nShifty interior\n\nBlink and you\u2019ll miss it. New for 2019 is a rotary dial gear shifter, which opens the cabin space a bit and makes center console bins more accessible. (Beverly Braga)\n\nThe interior does feature an all-new rotary gear selection dial, but other than having no traditional shifter and repositioning the front cup holders, the cabin is basically identical to the outgoing model.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not fan of the shifter knob. Dare I say that if I had to pick a poison, I\u2019d prefer dash-mounted shift buttons. Why? Because a rotary dial is easy to fidget with, especially when placed on the center console base where you\u2019re more likely rest your hand.\n\nI did purposely shift into park and reverse while driving just to see what would happen. (Yes, it was an empty road and, yes, I was traveling less than 20 miles per hour. Stop worrying, mom.)\n\nSo, what happened? Nothing eventful.\n\nFlicking the dial from drive to reverse or park forced the vehicle neither backwards nor to a stop. It did slow down as if the ECU was processing the command, but as the vehicle continued forward there was plenty of time to return the dial back to drive (if I had shifted accidentally). Still, at least dash-mounted buttons are closer to eye level.\n\nImpressive safety comes standard\n\nFord\u2019s suite of driver-assistance technologies makes its crossover SUV debut in the 2019 Edge, and the standard features are impressive for the segment. (Beverly Braga)\n\nNow, because crossovers are used more as family haulers than cargo carriers, safety is paramount, and the 2019 Edge is Ford\u2019s first crossover or SUV to feature it\u2019s new Co-Pilot360 suite of driver assistance and collision avoidance technologies.\n\nStandard on all models, this suite of five driver-assistance technologies includes:\n\nA rearview camera\n\nBlind spot monitoring with cross-traffic alert\n\nLane departure warning and lane-keeping assist\n\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nA pre-collision assist system with forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, dynamic brake support, and an automatic emergency braking system\n\nPost-collision braking is also standard, but is not part of the Co-Pilot360 package. Also, starting with the SEL trim, the optional Co-Pilot360 Assist+ package adds adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, lane centering assist, evasive steering assist, and a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system.\n\nHaving tested the Titanium\u2019s adaptive cruise control system, the stop-and-go feature is heaven sent for those whose commutes mostly take place in parking lots (aka any metropolitan area). The automatic emergency braking also will stop about a foot away from impact with a static object (like a unexpected hard-braker in traffic), but also gives drivers time to collect their bearings and take back control of the pedals.\n\nArriving in dealerships now, the base 2019 Ford Edge SE starts at $30,990 (including the $995 destination fee). My higher-trim Titanium test vehicle rang up at $44,890. For AWD, you\u2019ll spend an additional $1,995.\n\nThe midsize 5-passenger crossover segment is growing, with new models like the Chevrolet Blazer and redesigned models like the Hyundai Santa Fe creating new competition. But the new 2019 Edge\u2019s updates should help it to combat the slew of existing and new threats. You might even say that in many ways it has a \u201ccompetitive edge.\u201d\n\nFirst Pictures: 2019 Ford Edge\n\nSign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!\n\nDid you find this article helpful?

  "title": "3 Shopping Tricks for Petites",
  "url": "http://directory.nydailynews.com/style/sns-3-shopping-tricks-for-petites-20181005-story.html",
  "text": "I don't know if you knew this about me, but I'm only about 5 feet, 2 inches tall, (or should I say 5 feet small?) so shopping can be tricky sometimes. Over the years, I've discovered some shopping tricks that make finding clothes for shorter people much easier, so today I wanted to share my favorite three shopping tricks for petites!\n\n\n\n1. Accept that most things will have to be tailored.\n\n\n\nThe first step to successfully shopping for a petite frame is just accepting the fact that most things will have to be altered. The average height for women is 5 feet, 4 inches to 5 feet, 6 inches, so most clothing is not made for petite people; therefore, clothing needs to be adjusted to fit your body.\n\n\n\nA good tailor will be able to immediately see where clothing should be adjusted to best fit and flatter your frame. It's always a good idea to find a tailor that you like and establish a relationship with them, as that will make tailoring clothing easier long term, and they will begin to learn how you like your clothing to fit.\n\n\n\nIf you're getting a lot of clothing altered, it's a good idea to look into alterations programs at some retail stores or find a tailor near you. For example, I googled tailors in my area and came across one with great reviews. Taking my items to a local tailor has been so great, because I know my garments will now fit my frame perfectly. Having a professional available to hem a long dress or pants or whatever alterations you may need will make your clothing look that much better on you. It's a worthy investment that pays off in the long run.\n\n\n\n2. Cropped pants are your best friend.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to shopping tricks for petites, going for cropped pants is one of the best options. Even if there's no petite section, cropped pants will often work really well on a petite frame. Most of the time if I can find a pair of cropped or ankle pants, they will be the perfect full length pant for me with no alterations needed! I call this a win! Sometimes petite crop pants even work as full length pants on me depending on the inseam length, but you'll just have to test out the waters and see what works best for you.\n\n\n\nSide note: Cropped pants often go on sale in fall and winter because they're leftover from spring and summer clothing lines, so look for seasonal sales and swoop up all the cropped styles you can!\n\n\n\n3. There are some really good petite sections out there.\n\n\n\nWhile a lot of clothing still needs to be altered, there are some really good petite sections out there. Nordstrom has a great petite section, and so does Banana Republic. I'm also finding that a lot more stores are offering pants in \"short\" length. I recently even found shorter pants at Target! Generally, Zara and H&M work well for petite frames. Because they are international brands, they cater to a wider range of heights for women.\n\n\n\n(Whether she's dishing out advice on how to wear the latest trends or putting fun looks together, fashion writer and stylist Aramide Esubi is always on the move keeping up with the latest in fashion.

Betting against Tiger is less profitable at -275, meaning one would have to wager $275 to net $100 if Woods goes winless in the Masters, PGA Championship, U.S. Open and British Open.\n\nHere are the major championship prop bets for Woods for 2019.

However, the Tour Championship field was limited to 30 players.\n\nWoods won the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in record-breaking fashion. If he is going to reach that major pinnacle in his comeback, it appears all signs point to next June, when the Open returns to Pebble.\n\nThe PGA Championship will be held at Bethpage Black on Long Island in New York in May and the British Open is set for Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland in July.",

Crown Prince Mohammed reportedly offered Khashoggi government protection and a high-level job if he returned to the country, an offer the journalist was deeply skeptical of.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018Are you kidding?

The only available CCTV footage appears to show him entering the building but not leaving.\n\nOn Tuesday, The New York Times first reported that Turkish officials believed Khashoggi was assassinated under orders from senior members of the Saudi royal court. Those unnamed officials said they believed the operation was carried out by a squad of 15 people flown into Turkey on two charter flights \u2015 something that could only have been ordered by the country\u2019s leadership due to its complexity and risk.\n\nTurkish officials said the event reminded them of the film \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d and said one of the men wielded a bone saw they suspect was used to dismember the journalist\u2019s body.",

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told Fox News that Baker had shared \u201cexplosive\u201d information with the committees, including alleged \u201cconfirmation\u201d that \u201cthings were done in an abnormal fashion.\u201d Meadows did not elaborate, however, on what these \u201cthings\u201d were.\n\nFollow-up reports revealed that Baker, who resigned from the FBI in May, was questioned by the committees about Rosenstein\u2019s suggestion \u2015 first reported by The New York Times last month \u2015 that Trump should be secretly taped and possibly removed from office using the 25th Amendment.\n\nBaker told Congress that he and other FBI officials had taken Rosenstein\u2019s wire-tapping suggestion \u201cseriously\u201d \u2014 but had ultimately \u201cdismissed the idea within days,\u201d the Times reported on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFBI leaders played out its potential ramifications before rejecting it,\u201d the paper added, noting that Baker said he\u2019d learned of Rosenstein\u2019s wiretapping suggestion either from Andrew McCabe, who had been the acting FBI director at the time, or Lisa Page, a senior FBI lawyer.\n\n\u201cAs far as Baker was concerned, this was a real plan being discussed,\u201d a source familiar with the congressional investigation told investigative journalist John Solomon. \u201cIt was no laughing matter for the FBI.\u201d\n\nBaker\u2019s testimony appears to contradict claims made by Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani and a Justice Department source that Rosenstein\u2019s wire comment had been \u201csarcastic.\u201d\n\nFormer FBI lawyer: Plot to record, remove Trump not a joke https://t.co/lVjQC8R1IL \u2014 John Solomon (@jsolomonReports) October 9, 2018\n\nBaker reportedly told congressional investigators that he\u2019d also been aware that Rosenstein had discussed invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of a president deemed unfit for office.\n\nRosenstein has vehemently denied making any such suggestion, telling the Times last month that \u201cbased on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\u201d\n\nReports about Rosenstein\u2019s wiretap plan and 25th Amendment musings had initially led to intense speculation about the deputy attorney general\u2019s potential sacking or resignation.\n\nFor now, however, it appears that the Justice Department\u2019s second-highest official has avoided the chopping block.\n\nOn Monday, Trump invited Rosenstein aboard Air Force One and said the pair \u201cactually have a good relationship.\u201d A Justice Department official told The Washington Post this week that \u201cthere was real respect\u201d between the two men.",

  "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Marsha Appling-Nunez was showing the college students she teaches how to check online if they\u2019re registered to vote when she made a troubling discovery. Despite being an active Georgia voter who had cast ballots in recent elections, she was no longer registered.\n\n\u201cI was kind of shocked,\u201d said Appling-Nunez, who moved from one Atlanta suburb to another in May and believed she had successfully changed her address on the voter rolls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always voted. I try to not miss any elections, including local ones,\u201d Appling-Nunez said.\n\nShe tried re-registering, but with about one month left before a November election that will decide a governor\u2019s race and some competitive U.S. House races, Appling-Nunez\u2019s application is one of over 53,000 sitting on hold with Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp\u2019s office. And unlike Appling-Nunez, many people on that list \u2014 which is predominantly black, according to an analysis by The Associated Press \u2014 may not even know their voter registration has been held up.\n\nTuesday is Georgia\u2019s deadline to register and be eligible to vote in the November General Election.\n\nKemp, who\u2019s also the Republican candidate for governor, is in charge of elections and voter registration in Georgia.\n\nHis Democratic opponent, former state Rep. Stacey Abrams, and voting rights advocacy groups charge that Kemp is systematically using his office to suppress votes and tilt the election, and that his policies disproportionately affect black and minority voters.\n\nKemp denies it vehemently.\n\nBut through a process that Kemp calls voter roll maintenance and his opponents call voter roll purges, Kemp\u2019s office has cancelled over 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012. Nearly 670,000 registrations were cancelled in 2017 alone.\n\nIn a recent television appearance on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah\u201d Abrams called Kemp \u201ca remarkable architect of voter suppression.\u201d That\u2019s become a rallying cry for Democrats in the governor\u2019s race, which recent public polling shows in a statistical dead heat.\n\nKemp, meanwhile, says Abrams and allied liberal activists are twisting his record of guarding Georgia elections against voter fraud.\n\nHis campaign spokesman Ryan Mahoney said in a statement that because of Kemp, \u201cit has never been easier to vote in our state\u201d and pointed to a new online voter registration system and a student engagement program implemented under his tenure.\n\n\u201cKemp is fighting to protect the integrity of our elections and ensure that only legal citizens cast a ballot,\u201d Mahoney said.\n\nTwo main policies overseen by Kemp have drawn criticism and legal challenges: Georgia\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d registration verification process and the mass cancellation of inactive voter registrations.\n\nAccording to records obtained from Kemp\u2019s office through a public records request, Appling-Nunez\u2019s application \u2014like many of the 53,000 registrations on hold with Kemp\u2019s office \u2014 was flagged because it ran afoul of the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d verification process.\n\nUnder the policy, information on voter applications must precisely match information on file with the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. Election officials can place non-matching applications on hold.\n\nAn application could be held because of an entry error or a dropped hyphen in a last name, for example.\n\nAppling-Nunez says she never saw any notice from Kemp\u2019s office indicating a problem with her application.\n\nAn analysis of the records obtained by The Associated Press reveals racial disparity in the process. Georgia\u2019s population is approximately 32 percent black, according to the U.S. Census, but the list of voter registrations on hold with Kemp\u2019s office is nearly 70 percent black.\n\nKemp\u2019s office blamed that disparity on the New Georgia Project, a voter registration group founded by Abrams in 2013.\n\nKemp accuses the organization of being sloppy in registering voters, and says they submitted inadequate forms for a batch of applicants that was predominantly black. His office has said the New Georgia Project used primarily paper forms and \u201cdid not adequately train canvassers to ensure legible, complete forms ....\u201d\n\nHis office says \u201cthe law applies equally across all demographics,\u201d but these numbers became skewed by \u201cthe higher usage of one method of registration among one particular demographic group.\u201d\n\nVoters whose applications are frozen in \u201cpending\u201d status have 26 months to fix any issues before their application is canceled, and can still cast a provisional ballot.\n\nBut critics say the system has a high error rate and decry the racial disparity that it produces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown that this process disproportionately prevents minority applicants from getting on the voter registration rolls,\u201d Julie Houk, special counsel for the Washington based Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in an interview. With that in mind, she called it \u201ckind of astounding\u201d that Georgia legislators wrote it into state law in 2017.\n\nHouk\u2019s group wrote to Kemp in July threatening legal action if \u201cexact match\u201d wasn\u2019t ended.\n\nKemp\u2019s aggressive maintenance of the voter list has also garnered the threat of legal action.\n\nHis office says that they simply \u201cconduct regular list maintenance of the voter rolls to ensure election integrity\u201d as required by federal and state law. \u201cAll of the affected records were inactive as a result of returned mail, National Change of Address, and \u2018no contact\u2019 list maintenance procedures,\u201d it said.\n\nKemp dismissed and derided the legal threat targeting the \u201cexact match\u201d policy, issuing a statement saying that with Election Day coming up, \u201cit\u2019s high time for another frivolous lawsuit from liberal activist groups.\u201d\n\nHis office said that since January 2014, elections officials have processed over 6.4 million voter registrations and less than 1 percent remain in pending status.\n\nState Rep. Barry Fleming, who authored the state law enabling \u201cexact match,\u201d said in a statement that it\u2019s authorized under federal law, and courts have upheld a similar law in Florida.\n\nBut Appling-Nunez said it\u2019s important for every Georgian\u2019s vote, including hers, to be counted in November.",

Michaels, Killam claimed, told the show\u2019s writers to make Trump appear \u201clikable.\u201d\n\n\u201cLorne was being so specific about what we could and couldn\u2019t say about him,\u201d Killam says in the podcast, describing a proposed skit involving Trump being interviewed by CNN.\n\n\u201cHe was dictating a lot of the settings,\u201d he added, claiming Michaels argued against doing the sketch as follows:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be too old news by then, and you know, you don\u2019t want to vilify him. He\u2019s like any New York taxi driver. I know him, I\u2019ve seen him around at parties for years and years, and he just says whatever it is he\u2019s thinking, and that\u2019s his thing. But, you know, you have to find a way in that makes him likable and why don\u2019t we do something where it\u2019s him in his apartment, and it\u2019s him and Melania and he\u2019s just a guy...\u201d\n\n(As a bonus, Killam delivers all of the above in a plummy Lorne Michaels voice.)\n\nKillam says he was baffled by Michaels\u2019 directive.\n\n\u201cI was like, what is happening? What is going on?\u201d he told Gourley. \u201cEverybody that I know and respect is like, this guy is a bad dude, this guy is a buffoon.\u201d\n\nBut he said it all made sense to him several weeks after the toned-down segment aired, when he saw Trump\u2019s name added to the board of upcoming hosts. \u201cIt was like, oh, OK, that\u2019s why,\u201d he said. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\nMichaels has not responded to Killam\u2019s claims.\n\nTrump eventually hosted the show in November 2015. Killam said last year that the highly protested episode \u201conly grows more embarrassing and shameful as time goes on.\u201d",

He\u2019s also peddled falsehoods during his ongoing campaign rallies, doubled down on his attacks on the media and Democrats in Congress, and openly doubted sexual assault survivors who were protesting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nMost recently, during a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump supporters energetically revived the \u201cLock her up\u201d chant previously saved for Clinton in response to a false claim that Sen.

  "text": "Paris is a city with a vision: The end of the automobile age. Dependence on gas- and diesel-powered vehicles has come at a huge cost to Parisians\u2019 health and the environment in the metropolis of 12 million people. The French capital, regularly covered in a thick blanket of smog, has the worst air quality of any city in western Europe, according to a Greenpeace-commissioned study.\n\nMayor Anne Hidalgo believes it\u2019s time for radical action. She wants the city to become a fossil fuel-free zone, a place where people get around on foot, bicycles, public transit and \u2015 if necessary \u2015 in electric vehicles.\n\nShe has said that diesel cars will be banned by 2024, and last year she announced that all combustion-engine cars must be gone by 2030. A network of Parisian neighborhoods already goes car-free each Sunday, and cars are banned from a stretch of road along the river Seine in the city center. The city government is considering making public transit free to entice drivers to give up vehicle ownership altogether.\n\nCHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFP/Getty Images A family poses on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es on a car-free day in Paris last year.\n\nChristophe Najdovski, the deputy mayor of Paris responsible for transportation, told HuffPost that the ultimate aspiration is to pedestrianize the heart of Paris. \u201cParisians need breathing spaces. We also need to create the conditions for the development of alternatives so mobility is experienced in different ways. Less stress, less noise, less pollution.\u201d\n\nParis isn\u2019t the only European city with a plan to end the dominance of the internal combustion engine. Oslo aims to go car-free in its center beginning in 2019. Madrid will ban non-residents from driving in its city center starting in November, while another Spanish city, Pontevedra, has already banned cars from its downtown area.\n\nNational commitments are ramping up, too, with Denmark, Norway, France and the U.K. among those setting a date for phasing out conventional cars over the next two decades or so \u2015 even if none has yet cemented the commitment in law. And members of the European Parliament have just voted for a 40 percent cut in car emissions by 2030.\n\nThese moves fit with the sense that Europe may be moving, albeit slowly, toward \u201cpeak car\u201d: when private car use and ownership plateau and then drop, and when the internal combustion engine heads toward its grave.\n\nBut in the U.S., the cutback on cars is not happening to the same extent. In fact, it may be going backward as the Trump administration seeks to drastically roll back Obama-era legislation designed to make cars more efficient and less polluting. If the proposal goes ahead, it could mean up to 931 million metric tons of additional CO\u2082 pumped into the atmosphere by 2035. And this at a time when a landmark United Nations report says we are rapidly running out of time to reduce emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change.\n\nAmerica loves cars. Rates of ownership for cars and trucks are at their highest levels since the financial crisis a decade ago. And the ongoing addiction to fossil fuel-powered vehicles continues to have a hugely damaging effect.\n\nmilehightraveler via Getty Images Transportation eclipsed power generation to become the biggest single source of CO\u2082 emissions in the U.S. in 2016.\n\nTransportation eclipsed power generation to become the biggest single source of CO\u2082 emissions in the U.S. in 2016. As well as contributing to climate change, cars powered by fossil fuels make a major contribution to air pollution, which globally causes 7 million premature deaths a year.\n\nResearch has shown that the pollutants from car exhausts have a harmful effect on almost every organ system in our body. While effects on our lungs are better known, these pollutants also affect our brains. A Yale School of Public Health study has linked air pollution to a \u201chuge\u201d reduction in intelligence levels, while another study found evidence that those living near busy roads have an increased risk of dementia.\n\nCars have social effects, too. They have made American cities more sprawling and many people driving long distances to and from work find it miserable and isolating. In contrast, psychological well-being is boosted when people walk, cycle or use public transit, according to British research on commuting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing some cities around the world take really bold and aggressive action,\u201d said Gina Coplon-Newfield, director of the Clean Transportation for All campaign at the Sierra Club. \u201cLeaders in the U.S. should be willing to make those forward-looking commitments.\u201d\n\nSome moves have been made to curb cars, most notably in California. Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Santa Monica are among the cities that have committed to a C40 Cities declaration to cut the number of polluting vehicles on the streets and make cities more walkable. A bill proposed by a California lawmaker would ban gas-powered cars by 2040.\n\nBut even these approaches will be under threat if the Trump administration succeeds in gutting fuel efficiency legislation. Trump\u2019s proposal would also challenge California\u2019s ability to regulate car emissions and put an end to the state\u2019s program to encourage people and businesses to buy electric cars.\n\nThere are developments that offer hope. The rise of electric vehicles for one, which some hope will continue despite regulatory rollbacks. Electric cars could be cheaper than their gasoline-powered counterparts as soon as 2025, according to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. And cars powered solely by gas or diesel are expected to make up less than 50 percent of all new car sales in the U.S., Europe, China and India by 2031, according to a report from analysts IHS Markit.\n\nGetty Images Electric cars at a charging station in Amsterdam.\n\nAn electric revolution could stretch to public transportation, too. \u201cElectric buses are the ideal candidate to electrify \u2015 they will be a no-brainer for cities to invest in,\u201d said Daniel Cohan, associate professor of civil and environment engineering at Rice University in Houston. Currently only 300 of the more than 65,000 buses in the U.S. are electric, although cities such as New York, L.A. and San Francisco have set deadlines to convert their bus fleets to electric over the next few decades.\n\n\u201cIf more cities can team together to get bulk-rate deals, they can play a big role in helping jump-start the wider electric vehicle market,\u201d Cohan said.\n\nBut, although there are promising signs, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles remains slow. Consumers are put off by the lack of charging infrastructure and the higher cost of hybrids and electric cars compared with equivalent diesel and gasoline-only vehicles. For now, at least, conventional cars seem cheaper and easier to run.\n\nIn any case, replacing one type of car with another will not, on its own, usher in a sustainable society. Environmentalists believe a truly sustainable future demands far fewer vehicles and compelling alternatives to private ownership.\n\nFor one thing, mining vast quantities of the lithium and cobalt needed for electric vehicle batteries threatens to create a new kind of environmental problem. And some experts say that electric vehicles won\u2019t crack the pollution problem anyway, as the cars will only be as clean as the energy produced by the U.S., which still predominantly comes from burning fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cTo reduce the number of cars on the road, we need to provide people with the opportunity to switch from single-occupancy cars to good alternatives, whether it\u2019s public transit, biking, walking or in making use of carpooling and shared rides,\u201d said the Sierra Club\u2019s Coplon-Newfield.\n\nLeoPatrizi via Getty Images Commuters cycle in the center of Copenhagen, Denmark, which is frequently voted one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world.\n\nWhen it comes to public transit, however, for several decades U.S. authorities have failed to invest in any extensive new public transit projects. Systems have been left to languish unloved and underfunded while many put their hope in tech companies to solve mobility problems through electric vehicles, even electric scooters.\n\nMass transit advocates trying to convince the public of its merits have not been helped by the intervention of corporate interests into the debate.\n\nThe Americans for Prosperity group, for example, funded by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, has been waging well-organized political campaigns against rail and bus schemes in Nashville, Phoenix and Little Rock, Arkansas, and in other growing metropolitan areas across the country.\n\nA proposal for a light-rail system and new bus routes in the Tennessee capital was rejected by voters in May after the group successfully portrayed the plan as a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nPortland, Oregon-based public transit consultant Jarrett Walker thinks supporters of mass transit must explain the stakes of the debate in much starker terms.\n\n\u201cYou have to clearly describe what a no transit project vote means,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cVoters always falsely assume that if they say no, it means everything stays as it is. But in a growing region, that\u2019s false. So a future without the transit project \u2015 more car-dependence, more pollution, congestion, bad health and climate change \u2015 needs to be described clearly in all its horror.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.",

  "text": "President Donald Trump took aim at the Me Too movement once again on Wednesday night, saying he wasn\u2019t allowed to utter certain phrases because they were no longer politically correct.\n\nTrump, speaking at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, was reflecting on his election nearly two years ago and spoke about winning Pennsylvania in the 2016 presidential race. He said that for many years Republicans had been unable to capture those electoral college votes, and then he said there was an expression he wanted to use to describe the state, but he had to censor himself because the media was present.\n\n\u201cEvery Republican thinks they are going to win Pennsylvania, but I got it. I\u2019d use an expression, you know there\u2019s an expression, but under the rules of Me Too I\u2019m not allowed to use that expression anymore, I can\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018person\u2019 that got away.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump mocks #MeToo movement during rally in Pennsylvania, while speaking on his 2016 presidential campaign: \"Under the rules of #MeToo, I'm not allowed to use that expression.\" pic.twitter.com/N3ppCPVPin \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 10, 2018\n\nThe phrase the president was likely referencing was the Frank Sinatra song title, \u201cThe Gal That Got Away,\u201d his cover of \u201cThe Man That Got Away\u201d from the 1954 film \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d\n\nWhen someone in the audience shouted for the president to use the words anyway, Trump said: \u201cI would do it except for these people up there,\u201d pointing to the media. \u201cThere is an expression, but we\u2019ll change the expression. Pennsylvania was always the \u2018person\u2019 that got away.\u201d\n\nTrump, who regularly goes off script and champions himself as an enemy of political correctness, has lambasted the Me Too movement many times, most recently over the sexual assault allegation that California research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford leveled at Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a damn sad situation,\u201d the president said at a rally in Mississippi earlier this month. \u201cWe better start as a country getting smart and getting tough and not letting that stuff \u2015 right back there, those cameras \u2015 tell us how to live our lives.\u201d\n\nDuring the event on Wednesday, Trump touted several economic victories during his first years in office and noted that he did \u201cvery well\u201d in the last election due to female voters.\n\nThe president also slammed Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), who is running for re-election in next month\u2019s midterm elections, saying he was only in office because his father was the state\u2019s former governor.\n\n\u201cWhy do you have such a liberal senator in Pennsylvania? Oh. He\u2019s banking on the name of his father, which is no good,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he has to be voted out of office.\u201d",

  "text": "Conservative media has found a new boogeyman to froth over: civically engaged women.\n\nLast week, women all over the country left their homes and workplaces to protest the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice who they believe represents an ongoing crusade against their rights. They marched by the thousands. They screamed in the faces of their elected officials. They gritted their teeth and, once again, told horrifying stories of sexual abuse, so that their friends, family and colleagues might be heard too.\n\nThey were \ufeffstill doing so Wednesday.\n\nThis worries the right-wing media and the politicians who read it. Even after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, conservative news is trying to downplay, belittle and flat-out lie about protesters. Fox News, The Washington Times, Town Hall and The Daily Caller, among other outlets, latched on to storylines about \u201cpaid protesters\u201d attending various anti-Kavanaugh rallies. The Blaze called the demonstrators \u201cunhinged\u201d and said their numbers were padded by \u201cliberal celebrities\u201d; a Fox News contributor called them \u201cscreaming animals\u201d who should be \u201ctasered, handcuffed and dragged out of the building\u201d; Town Hall even published a column comparing the Kavanaugh protesters to Kermit Gosnell, a doctor who was convicted of murdering three infants.\n\n\u201cThe darkness of evil infiltrated the nation\u2019s capital during the Senate confirmation process of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh,\u201d Town Hall columnist Rebecca Hagelin wrote. \u201cYou could feel the vitriol in the shrills of protesters interrupting the hearings and the confirmation vote.\u201d\n\nThe list goes on. To conservative media, liberal women are rabid in their efforts to take down Kavanaugh; the wider point about the Me Too movement and the reproductive rights at stake are lost in the outrage. For some of the more extreme, Infowars-style websites on the right, fear-mongering headlines aren\u2019t a surprise. But the content pipeline between those sites, Fox News and the president\u2019s Twitter account is extremely short.\n\nWith each day comes another round of stories portraying peaceful protesters as either violent or part of a bad-faith campaign funded by liberal donors. President Donald Trump thinks anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators were a little of both, calling victims of sexual assault who cornered their congressmen \u201cpaid D.C. protesters\u201d and \u201cscreamers\u201d:\n\nThe paid D.C. protesters are now ready to REALLY protest because they haven\u2019t gotten their checks - in other words, they weren\u2019t paid! Screamers in Congress, and outside, were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2018\n\nTrump has been using this tactic against protesters since his presidential campaign, and he often gets his ideas for such rhetoric from the media he consumes. This particular outburst likely came from a Fox News segment, in which Wall Street Journal writer Asra Q. Nomani said that protesters are \u201cwaiting for their check.\u201d\n\nNomani, who once famously wrote about casting her vote for Trump, had been brought on air to talk about her op-ed claiming the \u201cprotests and unlawful disruptions\u201d were staged by a \u201cwell-funded network.\u201d She later backpedaled and said that \u201cmost individual protesters are not paid,\u201d but called the protests \u201cnot organic.\u201d Her comments gave the appearance of credibility to this conspiracy theory: Here was a Wall Street Journal writer \u2015 a former reporter for the paper, no less \u2015 claiming to be a \u201cliberal feminist\u201d and yet implying that there was some sinister connection between billionaire George Soros and protesters.\n\nNomani may have been unable draw a connection between paid organizers and real protesters \u2014 of which there were thousands in D.C. over the course of last week alone \u2014 but she didn\u2019t have to. The headline of her story was all anyone needed: \u201cGeorge Soros\u2019s March on Washington.\u201d That, and her comment on Fox News, allowed Republicans to make that connection for her, even though it\u2019s not true.\n\nIf organizers getting paid were a scandal, every Trump rally would be a scandal. But a scandal is what Republicans needed, and Nomani\u2019s poor judgment helped give them one. This is how the bad-faith echo chamber works, and GOP lawmakers were happy to join in.\n\nAs The Daily Beast reports, Sens. Chuck Grassley, John Cornyn and Mitch McConnell were among the politicians calling anti-Kavanaugh protesters a \u201cmob.\u201d McConnell said senators were \u201cliterally under assault.\u201d\n\nConservative media truly wants its audience to believe that women are being paid to do this. So far, women are not fazed.\n\nAna Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy who cornered Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in an elevator to tell him about her sexual assault, was featured in the Wall Street Journal piece \u2015 along with her salary. Archila was subsequently forced to defend herself against Trump\u2019s \u201cpaid protesters\u201d tweet.",

  "text": "POLITIQUE - La \"bromance\" entre Emmanuel Macron et Justin Trudeau va survivre \u00e0 Erevan. Pourtant, le XVIIe Sommet de la Francophonie qui se tient dans la capitale arm\u00e9nienne ces jeudi 11 et vendredi 12 octobre ne s'annon\u00e7ait pas sous les meilleurs auspices pour la relation franco-canadienne. Principal sujet de discorde: l'\u00e9lection de la prochaine secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) vendredi 12.\n\nQuatre anciens ministres des affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res fran\u00e7ais ont m\u00eame publi\u00e9 une tribune pour d\u00e9noncer le choix de la France de soutenir la candidate rwandaise, notamment parce qu'il entra\u00eenait \"un bras de fer inutile\" avec Justin Trudeau, soutien de la canadienne Micha\u00eblle Jean actuelle directrice de l'organisation et candidate \u00e0 sa r\u00e9\u00e9lection. Mais \u00e7a, c'\u00e9tait avant qu'Ottawa ne se rallie au consensus quelques heures avant le d\u00e9but du Sommet, comme le veut la tradition dans le c\u00e9nacle de la Francophonie.\n\n\"\u00c7a a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re de faire, on ne va pas la changer. On a bien vu qu'elle (Micha\u00eblle Jean) n'avait pas les appuis n\u00e9cessaires, il faut se rendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence\" se r\u00e9signe une source gouvernementale canadienne aupr\u00e8s de l'AFP.\n\nBataille d'influence en Francophonie\n\nMais ce choix, aussi \"traditionnel\" soit-il, ne s'est visiblement pas fait dans la plus grande simplicit\u00e9. Entre l'annonce du soutien affich\u00e9 de la France \u00e0 la candidature de l'actuelle ministre rwandaise des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res Louise Mushikiwabo en mai 2018 et le revirement canadien ce mardi, Emmanuel Macron et Justin Trudeau se sont vus \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Et chaque rencontre, a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'occasion - derri\u00e8re une ambiance courtoise - de marquer un peu plus le d\u00e9saccord des deux dirigeants sur le choix de la future patronne de l'OIF mais \u00e9galement sur les futures orientations de la Francophonie.\n\nR\u00e9unis \u00e0 l'ONU au d\u00e9but du mois de septembre, Emmanuel Macron et Justin Trudeau - consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme tr\u00e8s proches sur la sc\u00e8ne internationale - n'avaient d'ailleurs toujours pas trouver le fameux \"consensus\" que beaucoup appelaient alors de leur voix.\n\nD'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique essuie de nombreuses critiques -notamment de la part de Marine Le Pen en France- pour avoir fait le choix de soutenir la candidate rwandaise alors que le pays n'est pas reconnu pour son grand respect des droits de l'Homme et qu'il a abandonn\u00e9 le fran\u00e7ais pour l'anglais comme langue d'enseignement en 2008. \"Nous soutenons Louise Mushikiwabo parce que c'est la candidature de l'Afrique\", explique l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre aux accusations venant de France, d'Afrique et parfois du Canada.\n\n\"Ces critiques sont sans doute utilis\u00e9es par les Canadiens pour mousser la candidature de Micha\u00eblle Jean\", explique le politologue Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Jocelyn Coulon au HuffPost. D'autant qu'outre-Atlantique, Louise Mushikiwabo ne suscite pas l'adh\u00e9sion. Les Canadiens, qui avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 placer leur candidate \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l'OIF en 2016 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la d\u00e9sunion des pays Africains, esp\u00e9raient bien garder cette primeur.\n\nUne fa\u00e7on, aussi, d'accentuer le poids du Canada au sein de l'organisation, aujourd'hui deuxi\u00e8me contributeur financier de l'OIF \u00e0 hauteur de 50 millions de dollars par an. D'o\u00f9 l'importance de construire un consensus entre les deux candidates et leurs soutiens pour ne pas humilier le pays aux trois provinces, qui apporte un tiers du budget total de l'organisation.\n\nL'importance du consensus\n\nD'autant que Justin Trudeau et son homologue fran\u00e7ais entretiennent de tr\u00e8s bonnes relations depuis leur rencontre et s'affichent aujourd'hui comme une sorte de tandem rempart aux nationalistes incarn\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain. Le pr\u00e9sident Emmanuel Macron et le Premier ministre Justin Trudeau \"s'entendent et s'appr\u00e9cient tr\u00e8s bien (et) personne ne veut que l'autre ne perde la face\", explique une source proche de l'actuelle patronne de la Francophonie \u00e0 l'AFP. \"Le Canada et la France entretiennent une vieille relation et ils ont toujours partag\u00e9 les m\u00eames int\u00e9r\u00eats et les m\u00eame valeurs. (...) Ils sont tr\u00e8s attach\u00e9s au syst\u00e8me multilat\u00e9ral pr\u00e9sentement attaqu\u00e9 par l'administration Trump\" abonde Jocelyn Coulon.\n\nC'est pourquoi il n'est pas surprenant, en d\u00e9pit des int\u00e9r\u00eats divergents, que la France et le Canada s'accordent d\u00e9sormais autour d'un consensus. D'autant que la candidate sortante Micha\u00eblle Jean ne cesse d'\u00eatre fragilis\u00e9e, \u00e9pingl\u00e9e dans la presse pour des d\u00e9penses \"somptueuses\" \u00e0 la t\u00eate de la Francophonie, elle n'a que tr\u00e8s peu de chances d'\u00eatre reconduite. Justin Trudeau avait bien tent\u00e9 d'appeler plusieurs dirigeants africains \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2017 pour tenter de les rallier \u00e0 sa candidature,avant de renoncer in extremis faute de soutiens suffisants.\n\nSelon la presse qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, Paris aurait propos\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa de retirer la candidature de Micha\u00eblle Jean, en \u00e9change d'appuis aux Nations unies, o\u00f9 le Canada fait campagne pour un si\u00e8ge non permanent au Conseil de S\u00e9curit\u00e9. L'information a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mentie par le bureau du Premier ministre.\n\nQuoiqu'il en soit, le choix de la future dirigeante de l'OIF n'est pas le seul point de dissension entre Emmanuel Macron et Justin Trudeau. Si la \"bromance\" devrait r\u00e9sister \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de la future patronne de l'OIF, elle pourrait \u00eatre une nouvelle fois mise \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve lors de la discussion autour de l'adh\u00e9sion contest\u00e9e de l'Arabie saoudite en tant que membre observateur. Alors que la France se dit ouverte aux discussions, le Canada semble, comme en 2016 lors du pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent sommet, exclure totalement le cas de figure.\n\n\u00c0 voir \u00e9galement sur Le HuffPost:",

En vertu de son explosion d\u00e9mographique, l'Afrique, continent sur lequel se trouvent 27 des 54 membres de l'OIF ayant droit de vote, repr\u00e9sentera 85% des francophones en 2050, sur un total de 700 millions, contre 274 aujourd'hui, selon l'OIF.\n\nLe choix de l'anglais par le Rwanda\n\nMais si chacun s'accorde sur le fait qu'il est temps qu'une personnalit\u00e9 africaine dirige l'OIF, le choix du Rwanda et l'activisme de Paris pour d\u00e9fendre ce choix a suscit\u00e9 des critiques, y compris sur le continent africain. En France, la pr\u00e9sidente du Rassemblement National Marine Le Pen s'est dite \"indign\u00e9e que la France puisse soutenir une ministre de Kagam\u00e9 (le pr\u00e9sident du Rwanda, NDLR) qui est violemment anti-fran\u00e7aise, d'un pays qui a choisi de faire de l'anglais sa langue d'enseignement, sa langue d'administration, qui a tourn\u00e9 le dos au fran\u00e7ais\".\n\nLe Rwanda a en effet remplac\u00e9 en 2008 le fran\u00e7ais par l'anglais en tant que langue obligatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, avant de rejoindre le Commonwealth, pendant anglophone de l'OIF, un an plus tard. C'est d'ailleurs en anglais que le pr\u00e9sident rwandais Paul Kagame avait annonc\u00e9 la candidature de sa ministre, \u00e0 Paris en mai.\n\n\"Y a-t-il au monde un pays moins bien plac\u00e9 que le Rwanda pour pr\u00e9tendre pr\u00e9sider aux destin\u00e9es de la francophonie linguistique ? Sans doute pas\", d\u00e9ploraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 mi-septembre dans une tribune au quotidien Le Monde Charles Josselin, Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Wiltzer, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Conway-Mouret et Andr\u00e9 Vallini, quatre anciens ministres fran\u00e7ais charg\u00e9s de la francophonie.\n\n\"En poussant pour une telle candidature, Macron se fait l'ennemi de la francophonie. Il montre sa fascination morbide pour la langue du lib\u00e9ralisme et des \u00c9tats-Unis\", \u00e9trille \u00e0 son tour le chef de file de la France insoumise Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon.\n\nDans l'entourage d'Emmanuel Macron, on souligne a contraire que le plurilinguisme du Rwanda, loin d'\u00eatre un handicap, \"illustre parfaitement\" la politique inclusive du pr\u00e9sident, qui veut d\u00e9fendre le fran\u00e7ais sans l'opposer aux autres langues, une position contest\u00e9e par nombre de \"puristes\".\n\nLa langue n'est cependant pas le seul grief fait \u00e0 la candidature rwandaise, accus\u00e9e d'\u00eatre contraire \u00e0 la charte de l'OIF, qui a inscrit \"le soutien aux droits de l'Homme\" parmi ses missions premi\u00e8res. Le Rwanda pratique \"censure, menaces, arrestations, violences, assassinats\" contre les journalistes qui osent d\u00e9noncer l'autoritarisme de ses dirigeants, a r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res (RSF).\n\nL'embarrassant dossier saoudien\n\nLe Sommet d'Erevan devra se saisir d'un autre dossier sensible: la candidature contest\u00e9e de l'Arabie saoudite, qui souhaite rejoindre l'OIF en tant que simple observatrice, donc sans droit de vote.\n\nL'embarrassant dossier saoudien fait froncer plus d'un sourcil, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les violations des droits de l'Homme dans le royaume, encore illustr\u00e9es par la r\u00e9cente disparition de l'opposant Jamal Khashoggi. La candidature saoudienne est d'autant plus embarrassante que l'OIF doit ent\u00e9riner \u00e0 Erevan une r\u00e9solution sur \"la promotion de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les femmes et les hommes\".\n\n\u00c0 voir \u00e9galement sur Le HuffPost:",

  "text": "POLITIQUE - En mati\u00e8re de pouvoir d'achat, c'est l'une des mesures fortes mise en avant par le gouvernement. En cet automne 2018, la taxe d'habitation (TH) baisse de 30% avant un autre tiers en 2019 et une suppression totale en 2020. Pourtant, depuis plusieurs jours, certains contribuables qui ont re\u00e7u leur avis s'\u00e9tonnent sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux de voir le montant qu'ils doivent payer augmenter.\n\nParmi eux, l'humoriste Bruno Gaccio, historique des Guignols de Canal+. Sur Twitter, il a expliqu\u00e9 avoir d\u00e9couvert une augmentation de pr\u00e8s de 300 euros du montant qu'il doit payer. \"Quelqu'un peut m'\u00e9clairer?\", demande-t-il en conclusion.\n\nBon bah re\u00e7u taxe habitation.\n\n2017: 828\u20ac\n\n2018: 1121\u20ac\n\n\n\nVariation en pourcentage \u00e9crit sur la feuille: 35,39%\n\n\n\nJe pige pas bien pourquoi ils ont communiqu\u00e9 sur: \"\u00e7a va baisser de 30%?\" C'est debile.\n\n\n\nQuelque chose m'\u00e9chappe ? Quelqu'un peut m'\u00e9clairer ? \u2014 gaccio bruno (@GaccioB) 9 octobre 2018\n\nPlusieurs explications peuvent appara\u00eetre pour lui et pour tous ceux qui s'interrogent sur une augmentation de leur propre TH.\n\nVous avez d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9\n\nLe montant de la taxe d'habitation n'est pas calcul\u00e9 nationalement. Il se calcule sur la base de la valeur locative du bien que vous occupez (valeur qui augmente chaque ann\u00e9e en fonction de l'inflation ce qui fait m\u00e9caniquement augmenter la TH). Cette base est multipli\u00e9e par un taux municipal. Un changement de ville peut donc entra\u00eener une augmentation de la TH.\n\nPar ailleurs, cette taxe est calcul\u00e9e en fonction de la superficie occup\u00e9e. En clair un d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement dans la m\u00eame ville dans une surface plus grande ou dans un logement mieux \u00e9quip\u00e9 ou mieux situ\u00e9 entra\u00eene une hausse de la TH.\n\nVotre maire a augment\u00e9 le taux\n\nLa baisse de 30% d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par le gouvernement est calcul\u00e9e par rapport au montant que vous auriez du payer en 2018, pas par rapport \u00e0 celui pay\u00e9 en 2017. En clair, si votre maire a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'augmenter le taux pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 par la commune, il se peut que la baisse soit invisible ou moins visible. Selon un rapport parlementaire publi\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et mis en lumi\u00e8re par Le Parisien, ce sont 5680 \u00e9diles qui ont fait ce choix. C'est aussi le cas de 184 intercommunalit\u00e9s qui anticipent une baisse globale de leurs dotations. Mais il faudrait que la hausse d\u00e9passe les 30% de baisse d\u00e9cid\u00e9s par le gouvernement. Fort peu probable, selon la commission des Finances de l'Assembl\u00e9e.\n\nAussi, la baisse de 30% ne touche pas les 20% de Fran\u00e7ais les plus ais\u00e9s (les c\u00e9libataires touchant 2592 euros par mois et les couples avec enfant gagnant 4722 euros); ceux-ci ne devraient pas \u00eatre concern\u00e9s avant 2021, ann\u00e9e choisie par Emmanuel Macron pour exon\u00e9rer tous les contribuables. Pour ces Fran\u00e7ais, la plus petite hausse d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par les collectivit\u00e9s locales se verra sur l'avis d'imposition.\n\nVos revenus ont augment\u00e9\n\nSi elle est th\u00e9oriquement pay\u00e9e par tous les contribuables, la taxe d'habitation peut faire l'objet d'exon\u00e9ration ou de d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement en fonction des revenus. Voil\u00e0 pourquoi si vous avez gagn\u00e9 davantage l'an pass\u00e9, vous \u00eates susceptible de payer plus de TH.\n\nVous avez achet\u00e9 une t\u00e9l\u00e9\n\nEn plus de la taxe d'habitation, il faut r\u00e9gler en cet automne la contribution \u00e0 l'audiovisuel public, alias \"redevance t\u00e9l\u00e9\". Si vous n'aviez pas de t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur en 2017 mais en avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 un pour 2018, le montant de ce que vous devez payer augmente de 139 euros en m\u00e9tropole et 89 euros dans les d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer.\n\n\u00c0 voir \u00e9galement sur Le HuffPost:",

L'\u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par le cabinet Elementary Energy, et financ\u00e9e par la fondation European Climate Foundation (ECF). Elle int\u00e8gre tous les co\u00fbts support\u00e9s par les consommateurs durant la d\u00e9tention du v\u00e9hicule: assurance, carburant, financement, entretien et co\u00fbts de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation.\n\nL'avantage de l'\u00e9lectrique est encore plus important quand il s'agit d'un v\u00e9hicule d'occasion. \"Le gain de pouvoir d'achat, par rapport au diesel, atteint 940 euros par an, soit un co\u00fbt total de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieur de 28% pour une seconde main, et 1017 euros par an, soit -37% pour une troisi\u00e8me main\", affirme l'UFC-Que Choisir.\n\nBonus \u00e0 l'achat\n\nCe r\u00e9sultat s'explique par le fait que les v\u00e9hicules \u00e9lectriques repr\u00e9sentent un co\u00fbt en \u00e9nergie de 188 euros par an, bien inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui d'un v\u00e9hicule diesel (1181 euros par an) ou essence (1461 euros par an), explique l'association. Les voitures \u00e9lectriques profitent \"surtout d'un bonus de 6000 euros \u00e0 l'achat, sans lequel l'\u00e9lectrique ne serait pas rentable\".\n\nL'\u00e9tude souligne que le gain procur\u00e9 par une voiture \u00e9lectrique est plus important en zone rurale, car la distance moyenne parcourue par les automobilistes y est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Enfin, les v\u00e9hicules hybrides rechargeables (essence \u00e9lectrique) sont actuellement plus co\u00fbteux que les motorisations thermiques, lorsqu'ils sont achet\u00e9s neufs, mais deviennent \"rentables \u00e0 partir de la 2e main\".\n\nAfin de faire baisser les \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre dans les transports, l'association \"appelle le gouvernement \u00e0 imposer aux constructeurs une information sur le co\u00fbt global des v\u00e9hicules (...) pour faire \u00e9merger une r\u00e9elle offre alternative aux v\u00e9hicules essence et diesel\".\n\nLes voitures \u00e9lectriques ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 moins de 26.000 unit\u00e9s en France sur les neuf premiers mois de l'ann\u00e9e, et les hybrides rechargeables un peu plus de 10.000, sur un total de 1,66 million de voitures neuves immatricul\u00e9es.\n\n\u00c0 voir \u00e9galement sur Le HuffPost:",

  "text": "Il faudrait s'alarmer, d\u00e9plorer, geindre. \"Notre langue est en d\u00e9cadence, en pleine d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence\" (Jean-Marie Rouart, acad\u00e9micien, Lib\u00e9ration du 3 septembre); \"La langue fran\u00e7aise n'\u00e9volue pas, elle se d\u00e9sagr\u00e8ge\" (Eric Zemmour, Figaro magazine du 7). La cinquantaine de chefs d'Etat arriv\u00e9s aujourd'hui \u00e0 Erevan (Arm\u00e9nie) au Sommet de la Francophonie, se r\u00e9unissent-ils pour des obs\u00e8ques? Laissant les d\u00e9clinistes \u00e0 leur fonds de commerce rance, ils affichent qu'ils ont, selon l'heureuse expression de Maurice Druon, \"le fran\u00e7ais en partage\". Que dit ce \"Sommet\", qui n'a d'\u00e9quivalent pour aucun autre idiome? Que le fran\u00e7ais n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autant parl\u00e9 (220 millions de locuteurs), jamais autant \u00e9crit (des millions de pages sur la Toile), jamais autant appris (100 millions d'apprenants). Que cette langue est mondiale, qu'elle est vivante; mais aussi qu'elle est diverse.\n\n\"Notre langue\" appartient d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 tous ceux qui la parlent: nous n'y faisons plus la loi.\n\n\"Notre langue\" appartient d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 tous ceux qui la parlent: nous n'y faisons plus la loi. C'est sans doute l\u00e0 que le b\u00e2t blesse la m\u00e9lancolie. La France est devenue minoritaire en Francophonie; la norme, essentiellement fran\u00e7aise, perd de son autorit\u00e9: tel est le fait majeur de l'histoire r\u00e9cente du fran\u00e7ais. Chaque bouture a pris racine et s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9e, libre et vivace, portant de beaux fruits: termes propres, locutions particuli\u00e8res, fa\u00e7ons de dire aussi diverses que l\u00e9gitimes.\n\nAccueillons cet essor, en pensant une francophonie de l'\u00e9lan, et non pas du purisme.\n\nMontrons-nous tout d'abord plus r\u00e9ceptifs \u00e0 la vari\u00e9t\u00e9, en ne craignant pas d'adopter les francophonismes de bon aloi: des termes bien form\u00e9s, transparents, utiles enrichissent le fran\u00e7ais. L'impressionnante productivit\u00e9 francophone de la premi\u00e8re conjugaison des verbes, qui n'a rien \u00e0 envier \u00e0 la langue anglaise, en est un bon exemple. Les locuteurs de Suisse romande disent couramment agenderun rendez-vous. On saisit ais\u00e9ment le sens de ce terme et sa formation: ce verbe provient du substantif agenda. On mesure \u00e9galement la valeur de cette cr\u00e9ation, qui remplace la p\u00e9riphrase utilis\u00e9e partout ailleurs: noter dans un agenda. Ce n\u00e9ologisme, conforme au \"g\u00e9nie de la langue\", vient avec bonheur et bri\u00e8vet\u00e9 exprimer une notion jusqu'ici traduite gauchement: le fran\u00e7ais international l'attendait. Il en est de m\u00eame pour benner (\"basculer la benne d'un camion\"; Belgique), b\u00eatiser (\"dire des b\u00eatises\"; Ha\u00efti), confiturer (\"tartiner de confiture\"; Afrique centrale), fausser (\"chanter ou jouer faux\", Qu\u00e9bec), gr\u00e8ver (\"faire la gr\u00e8ve\", Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre), siester (\"faire la sieste\", idem), etc.\n\nLa langue-monde attend le dictionnaire de son essor (une compilation num\u00e9rique bienveillante des francophonismes dont elle s'est enrichie); elle attend la reconnaissance grammaticale de sa saine vigueur (inscription de la parit\u00e9 dans la langue).\n\nIl importe d'autre part d'accueillir les progr\u00e8s sociaux que la langue refl\u00e8te. La f\u00e9minisation des noms de m\u00e9tiers, titres et fonctions, l'un des changements linguistiques les plus amples de l'histoire du fran\u00e7ais, le montre exemplairement. Cette \u00e9volution, qui entend l\u00e9gitimement inscrire la parit\u00e9 dans la langue et accro\u00eetre la visibilit\u00e9 des femmes, pr\u00e9sente trois caract\u00e8res. Tout d'abord, elle s'accorde au \"g\u00e9nie de la langue\". La morphologie produit facilement des f\u00e9minins professionnels (avou\u00e9e, commandante, contractuelle, courti\u00e8re, informaticienne, etc.); les probl\u00e8mes sont infimes (m\u00e9decin, matelot), les difficult\u00e9s (mots en \u2013eur non li\u00e9s \u00e0 un verbe: ing\u00e9nieur, procureur, etc.) ais\u00e9ment lev\u00e9es par le suffixe n\u00e9ologique -eure diffus\u00e9 par le Qu\u00e9bec (ing\u00e9nieure, procureure). La grammaire, ensuite, attribue aux substantifs anim\u00e9s humains un genre solidaire de leur sexe: un adolescent, une adolescente; un Chinois, une Chinoise; un instituteur, une institutrice. Nous dirons donc un procureur, une procureure: employer le ministre au sujet d'une femme aggrave l'h\u00e9r\u00e9sie grammaticale d'une humiliation sexiste. Enfin, ce changement d'envergure, reflet d'un mouvement social d'\u00e9mancipation f\u00e9minine, fut essentiellement francophone. Parti en 1978 du Qu\u00e9bec de la R\u00e9volution tranquille, il gagna la Suisse, puis la Belgique, puis le Luxembourg, en arc de cercle autour d'un Hexagone qui r\u00e9sistait avec hauteur. Car la France, malgr\u00e9 un puissant courant r\u00e9formateur et deux initiatives gouvernementales (Yvette Roudy en 1984, Lionel Jospin en 1998), attendit les ann\u00e9es 2010 pour g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser la parit\u00e9 lexicale. La situation y est aujourd'hui invraisemblable, qui met en pr\u00e9sence une f\u00e9minisation g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e, en usage dans tous les registres de langue, et un discours puriste (l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise prescrit le genre masculin pour les fonctions \u00e9minentes) qui persiste \u00e0 la condamner aigrement.\n\n\"Le fran\u00e7ais s'est au fond \u00e9mancip\u00e9 de la France, il est devenu une langue-monde\u00bb. Ainsi s'exprimait le Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique le 20 mars 2018; que cet \u00e9loge d'un fran\u00e7ais \"archipel\" f\u00fbt, en un beau paradoxe, prononc\u00e9 sous la Coupole donnait \u00e0 penser. La langue-monde attend le dictionnaire de son essor (une compilation num\u00e9rique bienveillante des francophonismes dont elle s'est enrichie); elle attend la reconnaissance grammaticale de sa saine vigueur (inscription de la parit\u00e9 dans la langue). Le fran\u00e7ais-archipel doit s'ouvrir aux aliz\u00e9es du progr\u00e8s: telle est la t\u00e2che \u00e0 laquelle nous incite une langue universelle et qui se rit des frilosit\u00e9s.\n\nSEUIL\n\n\"Le ministre est enceinte, ou la grande querelle de la f\u00e9minisation des noms\", de Bernard Cerquiglini, \u00e9ditions du Seuil\n\n\u00c0 voir \u00e9galement sur Le HuffPost:",

Pris de panique, il court, son caf\u00e9 \u00e0 la main, tentant d'\u00e9chapper \u00e0 un gros poulet, d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 chasser le fuyard. Les deux protagonistes passent devant la cam\u00e9ra \u00e0 toute allure, \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'un film d'horreur ou d'un Looney Tunes, sauf qu'on ne voit pas l'issue de cette cavale.\n\nWe have a chicken at work and it loves attacking me when I let it out pic.twitter.com/IbhS0M1loY \u2014 Boaz or Bozy (@BroazM) 8 octobre 2018\n\nNous avons un poulet au travail et il adore m'attaquer quand je le laisse dehors.\n\nUne amiti\u00e9 bris\u00e9e\n\nL'homme en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 par le Daily Dot! Il s'appelle Boaz Marbach, a 22 ans et est \u00e9tudiant l'universit\u00e9 de Purdue Fort Wayne aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Il explique au journal qu'il \u00e9tait au travail quand cette poursuite infernale a eu lieu et sa relation tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciale avec ce poulet.\n\nD'abord, le jeune homme a une th\u00e9orie originale quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9nervement de l'oiseau: \"Je pense qu'il me poursuit parce qu'il veut impressionner les six poules avec lesquelles il vit\". C'\u00e9tait donc \u00e7a. Mais solidarit\u00e9 masculine oblige, Marbach n'est pas rancunier pour un sou. \"Je comprends cela\", ajoute-il.\n\nPourtant, le jeune homme s'\u00e9tait senti charg\u00e9 d'une mission personnelle vis-\u00e0-vis de ce coq. Une relation amicale semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 rompue apr\u00e8s cet incident: \"Je suis forc\u00e9 de le laisser sortir parce que toutes les filles avec qui je travaille ont peur de lui. C'est pour \u00e7a qu'il me poursuit .\"\n\nLa terreur r\u00e8gne chez Shed Interiors\n\nEt le pronostic de Marbach n'est pas rassurant. Peu tranquille, il assure que les relations avec ce poulet fou ne vont pas aller en s'am\u00e9liorant. M\u00eame s'il exclut cat\u00e9goriquement de cuisiner le volatile, l'\u00e9tudiant a pr\u00e9vu de ne plus se laisser faire: \"J'ai un balai pour le repousser\".\n\nLa guerre est donc d\u00e9clar\u00e9e chez Shed Interiors, le magasin de d\u00e9coration int\u00e9rieure o\u00f9 travaille Marbach, situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de Fort Wayne. Et \u00e0 la question de savoir pourquoi un tel endroit abrite un poulet vivant, Marbach n'a pas donn\u00e9 d'explication au Daily Dot.\n\nNous lui souhaitons bonne chance pour que l'ordre soit r\u00e9tabli.\n\nToujours est-il que cette fulgurante apparition a bien fait rire, qui n'a pas manqu\u00e9 de rappeler le c\u00f4t\u00e9 tyrannique des poulets...\n\nThe revolution soon come.

Apr\u00e8s le paiement effectu\u00e9, elle et son p\u00e8re sortent du magasin, quand un vigile les interpelle. Il leur signifie qu'ils ont mal bip\u00e9 certains articles. En effet, ceux-ci ont oubli\u00e9 de scanner les quatre couvercles qui se trouvaient sur les tupperwares, des articles vendus \u00e0 part avec leur propre code-barre.\n\nPlaidant l'\u00e9tourderie, le p\u00e8re et sa fille souhaitent de nouveau passer en caisse pour r\u00e9gler ces derniers. Mais, proc\u00e9dure oblige, le vigile doit aller pour cela en avertir le directeur du magasin. Les choses vont alors s'envenimer avec l'apparition de celui-ci. Malgr\u00e9 le r\u00e9cit du p\u00e8re et de sa fille, le directeur estime qu'ils ont voulu voler le magasin. Le ton monte alors et il finit par appeler la police face au refus du p\u00e8re de signer une d\u00e9position de vol.\n\n\"On vous embarque pour vol \u00e0 l'\u00e9talage organis\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs\"\n\nArriv\u00e9e sur place, celle-ci emm\u00e8ne les deux personnes dans deux fourgons s\u00e9par\u00e9s: \"on vous embarque pour vol \u00e0 l'\u00e9talage organis\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs\", selon le r\u00e9cit d'Emilie. Au commissariat, p\u00e8re et fille sont plac\u00e9s dans deux cellules diff\u00e9rentes pour un d\u00e9but de garde \u00e0 vue de 24 heures, quelque peu d\u00e9stabilisant pour Emilie qui donne tous les d\u00e9tails dans le thread \u00e0 lire en int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 plus bas dans l'article.\n\nFinalement, une femme du commissariat, comprenant qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e0 affaire \u00e0 de grands d\u00e9linquants, va appeler directement la juge au bout de deux heures pour qu'ils soient lib\u00e9r\u00e9s au plus vite. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu leur r\u00e9cit et compris leur bonne foi, la police les rel\u00e2che effectivement un peu plus tard.\n\nMorale de l'histoire, conclut Emilie: \"Scannez bien vos articles et n'oubliez pas que vous pouvez aller en garde \u00e0 vue pour des tupperwares\".\n\nContact\u00e9 par Le HuffPost, Ikea France indique avoir \"bien \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de l'incident du 1er octobre au magasin de Strasbourg\". \"Nous regrettons sinc\u00e8rement la situation, pr\u00e9sentons nos excuses et nous engageons \u00e0 retirer notre plainte contre cette jeune femme et son p\u00e8re\", d\u00e9clare le service communication du groupe, ajoutant qu'\"Ikea France tient toujours \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier le dialogue\".\n\nEmilie a ensuite r\u00e9agi \u00e0 la position d'Ikea France.\n\nMerci d'avouer vos tords, cependant la plainte (de ce que j'ai compris) est enlev\u00e9e depuis lundi soir, lorsque nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 innocent :/\n\nSi vous privil\u00e9giez autant le dialogue, ce thread n'aurait jamais exist\u00e9. https://t.co/xWJs182oAZ \u2014 Emilie (@thepeacefulriot) 10 octobre 2018\n\nLisez le t\u00e9moignage complet d'Emilie publi\u00e9 sur Twitter ci-dessous\n\n@thepeacefulriot Twitter\n\n@thepeacefulriot Twitter\n\n@thepeacefulriot Twitter\n\n@thepeacefulriot Twitter\n\nA voir \u00e9galement sur Le HuffPost:",

  "text": "LGBTQI - C'est la journ\u00e9e internationale du coming out. \u00c0 cette occasion, l'institut de sondage Ifop d\u00e9voile, ce jeudi 11 octobre, en collaboration avec l'agence de communication Tell me the truffe, une \u00e9tude sur le pourcentage de personnes homosexuelles qui ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 leur orientation sexuelle. R\u00e9alis\u00e9e sur un \u00e9chantillon repr\u00e9sentatif de la population fran\u00e7aise homosexuelle, bisexuelle et trans, elle montre que beaucoup d'entre eux sont encore tr\u00e8s discrets sur cette question sur leur lieu de travail.\n\nSeules 48% des personnes interrog\u00e9es ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir parl\u00e9 de leur sexualit\u00e9 \u00e0 au moins un de leurs coll\u00e8gues, r\u00e9v\u00e8le l'enqu\u00eate. Chez les homosexuels, le taux est de 75%, contre seulement 31% pour les bisexuels.\n\n\"Ce chiffre, l\u00e9g\u00e8rement inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui relatif aux membres de l'entourage, d\u00e9montre qu'une certaine aversion au coming out persiste dans l'entreprise, surtout aupr\u00e8s des personnes bisexuelles mais notons qu'un quart des homosexuels d\u00e9clare 'se cacher' aupr\u00e8s de leurs coll\u00e8gues\", peut-on lire en commentaire de l'\u00e9tude.\n\nCependant, cette r\u00e9ticence s'exprime essentiellement envers un groupe de personnes au travail. Qui \u00e7a? Les sup\u00e9rieurs hi\u00e9rarchiques. Seuls 39% des sond\u00e9s d\u00e9clarent que leur orientation sexuelle est connue de leurs responsables, soit moins de quatre personnes sur dix.\n\nL'homosexualit\u00e9 est encore tabou\n\nComment expliquer une telle distance? Pour beaucoup, l'homosexualit\u00e9 est encore un tabou. Elle peut \u00eatre per\u00e7ue comme un frein dans l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'emploi et dans l'\u00e9volution professionnelle. C'est ce que d\u00e9montre le sondage. 19% des personnes LGBT assurent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 discrimin\u00e9es en raison de leur orientation sexuelle par des recruteurs.\n\nQui plus est, au sein m\u00eame de l'entreprise, un quart des personnes interrog\u00e9es estime avoir fait l'objet de discrimination en raison de leur orientation sexuelle par des sup\u00e9rieurs ou des coll\u00e8gues. \"Ce qui nous a le plus frapp\u00e9s, c'est la grande diff\u00e9rence de ressenti entre les hommes et les femmes: le sentiment d'\u00eatre discrimin\u00e9 sur son lieu de travail monte \u00e0 42% lorsqu'on est lesbienne\", a comment\u00e9 David Herz, co-fondateur de Tell me the truffe.\n\nS'ensuit forc\u00e9ment un sentiment d'exclusion au quotidien dans l'entreprise et diverses attitudes comme le fait de renoncer \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement organis\u00e9 par l'entreprise o\u00f9 les conjoints des salari\u00e9s \u00e9taient invit\u00e9s, ou \u00e0 inscrire le nom de son partenaire sur la mutuelle.\n\nComme le r\u00e9v\u00e8le, en parall\u00e8le, le magazine T\u00eatu, en collaboration avec le Boston Consulting Group, la France est loin d'\u00eatre un bon \u00e9l\u00e8ve en la mati\u00e8re. Sur un classement de 15 pays, elle se hisse seulement \u00e0 la septi\u00e8me place o\u00f9 il fait bon de d\u00e9clarer son orientation sexuelle au travail quand on est une personne LGBT. C'est au Royaume-Uni et aux Pays Bas qu'elle se sentent le plus \u00e0 l'aise pour le faire.\n\n\u00c0 voir \u00e9galement sur Le HuffPost:",

  "text": "PMA - L'association SOS Homophobie a lanc\u00e9 ce jeudi 11 octobre sa \"campagne de sensibilisation nationale sur la PMA\" alors que le d\u00e9bat s'installe de plus en plus \u00e0 l'approche du projet de loi bio\u00e9thique qui sera d\u00e9pos\u00e9 avant la fin de l'ann\u00e9e et proposera l'ouverture de cette pratique m\u00e9dicale aux femmes c\u00e9libataires et couples de femmes.\n\nAvec le court film de 45 secondes diffus\u00e9 sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, et que vous pouvez voir en t\u00eate d'article, l'association veut rappeler \"que ce qui compte avant tout, c'est \u00eatre un bon parent\" et n'ont pas d'avoir imp\u00e9rativement un p\u00e8re et une m\u00e8re comme le mart\u00e8lent les opposants.\n\nLe clip montre une maman et son fils dans diff\u00e9rentes situations du quotidien, du r\u00e9veil \u00e0 l'heure du coucher, \u00e0 travers les yeux du deuxi\u00e8me parent. Tout au long de la vid\u00e9o, une voix off se demande ce qui fait un bon parent, passant en revue les arch\u00e9types souvent attribu\u00e9s au p\u00e8re ou \u00e0 la m\u00e8re.\n\nEst-ce \"celui qui prend du temps pour sa famille ou celui qui se d\u00e9m\u00e8ne pour qu'elle ne manque de rien\", \"celui qui joue ou celui qui aide \u00e0 faire les devoir\", \"celui qui gronde ou celui qui r\u00e9conforte\"? Alors que la s\u00e9quence touche \u00e0 sa fin, la petite famille prend une photo et l'on d\u00e9couvre que l'autre parent est elle aussi une femme. \"Et si on donnait \u00e0 tout le monde la chance d'\u00eatre un bon parent. PMA, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 n'attend pas\", conclut la vid\u00e9o.\n\n\"Ne vous inqui\u00e9tez pas pour nos enfants. Ils sont aim\u00e9s\"\n\nAvec cette campagne, SOS Homophobie \"veut montrer qu'\u00eatre parent est universel, que cela d\u00e9passe les notions de genre et d'orientation sexuelle\", explique son pr\u00e9sident Jo\u00ebl Deumier au HuffPost. Ce dernier souhaite accompagner et sensibiliser \u00e0 la PMA tout au long du d\u00e9bat pour \u00e9viter de \"revivre la d\u00e9ferlante de haine qu'on a v\u00e9cue en 2012-2013 contre les couples homosexuels et les familles homoparentales\".\n\nCe spot de SOS Homophobie diffus\u00e9 sur internet sera accompagn\u00e9 sur le terrain par la distribution de tracts et de guides \"vrai/faux\" pour d\u00e9construire les id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues sur la procr\u00e9ation m\u00e9dicalement assist\u00e9e, pr\u00e9cise Jo\u00ebl Deumier qui notait un peu plus t\u00f4t en conf\u00e9rence de presse qu'\"une majorit\u00e9 de Fran\u00e7ais sont favorables \u00e0 cette mesure mais qui ne le disent pas forc\u00e9ment\". Selon les derniers sondages, entre 60 et 75% des Fran\u00e7ais sont favorables \u00e0 l'ouverture pour toutes de la procr\u00e9ation m\u00e9dicalement assist\u00e9e.\n\nCe jeudi, Franceinfo publie par ailleurs de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 une tribune en faveur de la PMA sign\u00e9e par personnalit\u00e9s politiques, sportives et m\u00e9diatiques ainsi que des associations. \"Ne vous inqui\u00e9tez pas pour nos enfants. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sir\u00e9s. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attendus, parfois longtemps. Ils sont aim\u00e9s. Nos familles n'ont pas moins de valeur que les v\u00f4tres. Il est insupportable qu'elles soient ainsi scrut\u00e9es et jug\u00e9es. Et si nos enfants souffrent de quelque chose aujourd'hui, c'est d'\u00eatre ainsi rejet\u00e9s, montr\u00e9s du doigt par des soi-disant d\u00e9tenteurs de v\u00e9rit\u00e9\", d\u00e9noncent 90 femmes.\n\n\"Qu'est-ce que vous attendez ?

Donc remettons les pendules \u00e0 l'heure d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but: cet article sera \u00e9crit sur le ton de l'humour et de l'autod\u00e9rision. J'aime mes enfants et jamais je ne regretterai de les avoir. M\u00eame si parfois je me demande ce qu'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ma vie sans eux... Ceci \u00e9tant dit, ils sont le centre de mon monde et je suis heureuse d'\u00eatre leur maman. Par contre, vous serez d'accord qu'il a des fois o\u00f9 on aurait aim\u00e9 qu'ils ne soient pas l\u00e0, l'espace d'un instant. Ces moments o\u00f9 ils nous emp\u00eachent de faire des choses qu'on cr\u00e8ve d'envie de faire. Allez, avouez!\n\nQuand on te propose un plan g\u00e9nial \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute\n\nImaginons deux secondes que votre amie vous appelle surexcit\u00e9e, et vous tient ces propos:\"TU SAIS PAS QUOI??? Je viens de gagner des places pour le concert de C\u00e9line Dion ce soir!!!! Viens avec moi!!!\". Imaginons deux secondes que vous \u00eates une fan absolue de C\u00e9line Dion, que vous avez appel\u00e9 votre fils Ren\u00e9-Charles et que votre r\u00e9veil du matin c'est \"Pour que tu m'aimes encore\". BON. Vous voyez o\u00f9 je veux en venir? \"Bah non \u00e9coute je peux pas, tu me prend de court, j'ai personne pour garder Ren\u00e9-Charles, je ne peux pas bouger\". C'est franchement ballot hein.\n\nQuand t'as la cr\u00e8ve\n\n40\u00b0C de fi\u00e8vre, le nez en chute du Niagara, les yeux gonfl\u00e9s comme jamais. Vous n'avez qu'une envie c'est de mourir au fond de votre lit. Vous avez \u00e0 peine du mal \u00e0 tenir debout et votre t\u00eate est occup\u00e9e par l'orchestre philarmonique de Vienne. Bref, c'est pas la grand forme. Oui mais votre enfant, la chair de votre chair, a besoin de vous. Il faut donc l'habiller, le nourrir, l'occuper, toute la journ\u00e9e. 8h longues heures d'affil\u00e9es.\n\nQuand il est malade\n\nGenre gastro d\u00e9gueulasse. Et que tu te retrouveras \u00e0 \u00e9ponger ses fluides corporels tout le weekend. \"fluide corporel\" c'est le mot poli pour d\u00e9signer le caca et le vomi, pour ceux qui voudraient que je sois plus sp\u00e9cifique. Donc comme je le disais, tu passeras le weekend, voire la semaine, \u00e0 nettoyer le caca qui d\u00e9borde, le vomi un peu partout... Que ton chez toi ne sera qu'un nid \u00e0 microbes, pour le peu que tu sois hypocondriaque et l\u00e0 je peux te garantir que tu regretteras de l'avoir fait cet enfant!!\n\nQuand il ram\u00e8ne des poux \u00e0 la maison\n\nPlus ou moins le m\u00eame d\u00e9lire que pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, sauf que l\u00e0, ces petites b\u00eates vivantes et coriaces te feront faire le m\u00e9nage \u00e0 fond du fond pendant minimum un mois. A tout laver, tout trier, astiquer, aspirer, enfermer dans des sacs pour tuer la vermine. Et forc\u00e9ment tu les choppera aussi ces satan\u00e9es bestioles. J'esp\u00e8re juste que tu n'auras pas \u00e0 raser ta t\u00eate comme une \u00e9vad\u00e9e de prison.\n\nQuand tu as accumul\u00e9 2 ans de retard de sommeil\n\nL\u00e0 c'est vicieux car le mal s'installe doucement. Au d\u00e9but t'es pleine de bonne volont\u00e9, pleine d'amour pour cet enfant qui vient de naitre. Et puis au fur et a mesure, la fatigue se fait ressentir au plus profond de ton \u00eatre. C'est \u00e0 dire que m\u00eame tes orteils sont crev\u00e9s. Ton fils fait ses nuits mais bon, les dents, les cauchemars, les pipis nocturnes, les \"pas envie de dormir\", font que tu te r\u00e9veilles r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement dans la nuit.

  "text": "Gone are the days when women political candidates felt they had to imitate their male counterparts and downplay their femininity to win elections.\n\n\u201cWomen had to be seen as tough, tough on crime, tough if there was a war,\u201d says New York-based reputation, crisis and culture consultant Davia Temin. \u201cAfter all, you were going to be commander-in chief if you were running for president, so you had to exude some toughness.\u201d\n\nIn other words, voter expectations of a candidacy were associated with men and masculinity.\n\n\u201cWomen were sort of tasked with adapting to the role of being \u2018man enough\u2019 to be a political leader,\u201d says Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers. \u201cSo that meant proving you\u2019re tough, strong, showing yourself in your suit, talking about national security and defense, all of those things.\u201d\n\nNew York consultant Temin, who has worked with female political candidates to help make their voices more effective and powerful, says projecting too tough of an image can backfire\n\n\u201cThe first time she ran, Hillary\u2019s [Clinton] rap was that she was too tough and everybody loved her when she cried,\u201d she says. \u201cSo this is a see-saw and I don\u2019t think we have gotten to the balance point yet.\u201d\n\nGoing into next month\u2019s midterm elections, more women are nominees for public office, including the U.S. Congress, than ever before. Female candidates are gaining ground in part because they\u2019re done with trying to imitate their male counterparts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a high number and concentration of women who are willing to speak openly and use gender and their distinct experiences as women as a value added to their candidacy instead of like a hurdle they have to overcome,\u201d says Dittmar.\n\nIf you check out a television ad for Congressional candidate Jennifer Wexton, you\u2019ll find the Virginia Democrat touting her minivan-driving, working mom credentials as much as her professional experience as a prosecutor.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Michigan Republican Congressional nominee Lena Epstein, whose television ad underscores how hard it is to be a woman in a man\u2019s world.\n\n\u201cWe see women saying, \u2018I don\u2019t have to just meet the expectations that have already been set about men and masculinity and political leadership,\u2019\u201d says Dittmar.\n\n\u201c'But instead I\u2019m going to offer you some new credentials, some new traits, some new values that you should care about in your political leaders.\u2019 And so they use their experiences and their traits that are more often associated with women, with femininity.\u201d\n\nThese female candidates emphasize the value of being in tune with women, who make up more than 50 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nThey often highlight the empathy that can only come with knowing what it\u2019s like to be sexually abused or assaulted, or understanding how doors can be closed in your face because you are a woman.\n\nTemin says that sense of authenticity can make all of the difference for women candidates.\n\n\u201cYou want somebody steady, firm, believable, true, real, authentic\u2026that what they say truly reflects what they believe,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I believe that when you\u2019re congruent in what you\u2019re talking about, you channel a power\u2026it\u2019s a real power. It\u2019s not just made up stuff, it\u2019s not just talking points, and it\u2019s not just playing to the surveys and the polls.\u201d",

  "text": "Every year in mid-March, the International Nomads Festival brings people from around the world to the desert town of M\u2019hamid el Ghizlane. They gather to celebrate nomadic life of the Sahara desert. For three days and nights, the town is abuzz with activities ranging from 4\u00d74 Sahara tours to the Great Dunes of Erg Chigaga to late night, desert-rock concerts.\n\nIn 2017, I enjoyed all of these activities immensely. There is something about the vastness of the Sahara that opens my spirit like no other place on earth.\n\nLike the spirit opening effect of the Sahara, the music at the festival was also breathtaking. For three nights, internationally renowned Nomad desert-blues and rock bands, such as Bombino (Niger) and Terakaft (Mali), and Moroccan superstars like Saida Charaf and Mohamed Jbara, rocked the town stage.\n\nThe streets were crowded with local townsmen, women, school kids, hippies, Sahara trekkers, adventurers and festival goers from all over the world. Vendors were hustling their specialties: kabobs, hot coffee, spiced tea, argan oil, soap, sugar-coated nuts. Men dominated most of the standing spaces in front of the stage. Women and children stood and sat on street curbs and landscape. There was a special place on one side of the stage reserved for a boisterous class of school girls. The ambiance was sweet.\n\nHowever, the best part of the music was not on the stage. Not for me anyway. It was back at the Hotel Kasbah Azalay before and after the concerts. This hotel housed all the musicians, international journalists, special guests, dignitaries and tourists. The rooms are beautiful and spacious and the hot showers were amazing! The dining room served as the meeting point at breakfast primarily and the bar/cafe had reliable WiFi, good espresso, and alcohol. This was the true \u201cchill and jam\u201d spot of the festival.\n\nHere is where I bumped into Terakaft for this impromptu jam\u2026\n\nOutside and around the corner, Bombino agreed to play even though he didn\u2019t even have an amp for his electric guitar. The start-up group from M\u2019hamid, the Young Nomads, also gathered in the same spot, eager to play for the press.\n\nAnother day oudist and music professor Abdou Ouardi played for me on the rooftop. We even jammed together to the tunes of George Gershwin\u2019s Summertime and Tizol and Ellington\u2019s Caravan.\n\nThe magic of the music at the Nomad Festival happens on and off stage. Combine that with the beauty of the desert and its people, it\u2019s an experience worth having. Don\u2019t expect to find a lot of diversity just yet, however. The \u201cinternational\u201d aspect of the Nomad Festival is limited to the countries close to and bordering the Moroccan Sahara. There was the exception with the trio of Polish bands that performed; Dikanda, Dudy Skrzypce, and Magda Navarette, but the trio was a bit of head scratcher. While the groups were the most international of musical acts, their connection to nomadism was not obvious. In an earlier publication of this article I stated that none of the Polish bands were nomads or gypsies. According to Festival Director Noureddine Bourgrab however, some of them have nomadic roots in the Beskid Mountains in the Carpathians.\n\nDespite the limited geographic scope of the music acts, the festival still has other cultural and historical features that continue to attract international attention. I look forward to future festivals that can keep its current chill and jam ambiance, yet also add nomadic music that comes from other deserts of Africa and the world.\n\nAll photos were taken at the 2017 International Nomads Festival by Heather Maxwell and Louis Tissier.",

  "url": "http://blogs.voanews.com/music-time-in-africa/2016/09/20/music-post-ebola-artist-amaze-says-hipco-songs-made-tremendous-impact/",
  "text": "Music had a big role to play both during and in the aftermath of the West Africa Ebola epidemic. I found that out when I visited Monrovia in August. A lot of artists wrote songs about the personal experiences people had facing the disease. Henry Amazin\u2019 Toe, a.k.a Amaze, is a well-established hipco artist who composed and recorded such songs.\n\nI met Amaze several times during my stay in the Liberian capital. The first time was during a group interview I held in Mamba Point with other artists (Teddy Ride and Margaret Cephus). Then again at our VOA Town Hall at the YMCA. Amaze performed with his female MC counterpart Peaches and answered questions about music and Ebola after his set. I also saw him perform live at the number one hipco music joint in Monrovia, \u2018146\u2018. The club is owned and run by hipco pioneer and revered music legend, Takun J.\n\nAmaze, who\u2019s is 29 years old, made two important points about music and Ebola during our conversations . First, he said that music impacted Ebola immensely.\n\n\u201cMusic is what people listened to. Its what made people wash their hands with chlorine. It was what made people start being hygienic\u2026especially hipco.\u201d And those last two words, \u201cespecially hipco,\u201d was Amaze\u2019s second important point.\n\n\u201cHipco is sub of what they call Hip Hop in America. We borrowed it. Co is Coloquois (or Kolokwa) \u2013 our local way of speaking in Liberia. So people listen mostly to hipco mostly because we communicate through hipco easily.\u201d\n\nIn my earlier post about hipco star Teddy Ride, I\u2019d discovered that for some musicians, like Teddy, Ebola helped them become famous. It boosted the music industry in Liberia. But my encounters with Amaze in Monrovia made it very clear that music made a difference for a lot of terrified, grief and panic-stricken Liberians. Just before I met him outside of the Town Hall on Broad Street, I had a chat with another musician about the impact of music and musicians during the Ebola epidemic in 2014-16. Ebeneezer is the keyboard player and leader of the band who backed up Amaze, Peaches, Teddy Ride and the other featured artists.\n\nAmaze composed two songs about Ebola: \u201cSpread the Word\u201d and \u201cKickback Kick to Ebola.\u201d The first song was released during the height of the outbreak. Its purpose was to sensitize and educate people about the disease. He said, \u201cEvery artist back then would contribute. So we had to do everything we could do to sensitize and \u201cconscietize\u201d through music. After the Ebola period, when Ebola subsided fear was still in Liberians so I thought it wise to write a song \u201cKickback Kick to Ebola.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026so we had to make people come back to doing what they used to do because the fear was very in Monrovia and Liberia. As artists who people listen to we had to find a way to make people happy again. Here\u2019s a little more from his performance at the Town Hall with Peaches.\u201d\n\nThese days Amaze is focusing on the upcoming 2017 national election. He is currently on tour and promoting his new song and music video to engage voters to get involved in the election process now. In his most recent video \u201cKnow Who to Vote For,\u201d Amaze teams up with his familiar partner Peaches, plus J-Glo and Hovor. Their message in colorful Coloquois: \u201cDon\u2019t vote on the basis of ethnicity, money, education level, or nepotism. Vote for the common good of Liberia.\u201d\n\nLiberia was declared free of active Ebola transmission on January 14 2016.",

  "text": "On August 9th, 2016 I visited Liberia, about eight months after it was declared Ebola Free. My VOA colleague Jackson Mvunganyi and I went as a team to learn the role music played during and after the epidemic that ravaged that country in 2014-2015.\n\nWe held a Town Hall meeting and over six days met with youths and musicians in Monrovia and neighboring regions.\n\nI met over a dozen musical artists and interviewed six of them in Monrovia. Each had their own unique experience within their communities during the active Ebola period and its aftermath. Music indeed played a powerful and positive role throughout the crisis, but conversely, the epidemic had a powerful impact on the music industry and the lives of Liberian artists.\n\nIn the next few posts, I will focus on several of the artists interviewed. But here its all about 24 year old Teddy Ride.\n\n\u201cI had talent in high school and I was always thinking about how to get started on my songs. Okay so all of a sudden I came up to town and then I saw this engineer. I had money on me. Everybody never wanted to work because it was Ebola time. But I still stay with the whole program with the little money I had. and then people said \u2018 okay let\u2019s go to the studio hear what he got. And then when I start there, my very first song was a hit.\u201d\n\nThat hit song was \u201cPretty Mama\u201d . . .\n\n\u201cThe Ebola period caused our entertainment industry to grow. Now people don\u2019t often by Nigerian digs: other countries\u2019 movies. Liberian movies are on the rise\u2026and some artists like me have our fame \u2026 and we still got thousands and thousands of people who follow our songs all over Liberia. So it now goes to us, even though we came up small, but now its almost like a responsibility\u2026something we need to do.\u201d Teddy Ride.\n\nTeddy gives much of the credit for his success to Ebola. \u201cEbola helped make some of us popular,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then everybody was glued to the radio. Everybody was listening to the radio.\u201d\n\nPeople stayed inside their homes during the height of the epidemic for fear of catching the virus. So Teddy enjoyed massive, captive audiences with his new songs. Here\u2019s Teddy alongside Margaret Cephus and Amazin\u2019 after our interview doing a drop for MTIA.\n\nAnother important thing about Teddy Ride is he\u2019s a hipco artist. What\u2019s Hipco? Teddy described is this way: \u201cHipco is music that speaks to people\u2019s minds.\u201d In more technical terms, hipco is the Liberian style of Hip Hop. Its been around since the 1980s. Hip is borrowed from American English and \u2013co comes from coloquois (or kolokwa), the most common pidginized form of Liberian English.\n\nThe Town Hall was well attended by groups of engaged youths, both men and women.\n\nListen here to the Music Time in Africa radio feature on Ebola and music in Liberia featuring Teddy Ride and also Amazin\u2019 and Quincy B.",

  "url": "http://blogs.voanews.com/science-world/2018/09/15/study-pluto-should-be-a-planet/",
  "text": "NASA released this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on 9/25/15. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC) on 7/14/15. (NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI)\n\nIn 2006, members of the International Astronomical Union or the IAU, an organization recognized as the authority for naming celestial bodies, voted on a set of characteristics that define what makes a planet a planet.\n\nOne of those traits required a planet had to \u201cclear\u201d its orbit; meaning it had to provide the greatest gravitational force in its orbit.\n\nSince the gravity of Neptune influences Pluto (and whose orbits intersect twice over one rotation of the Sun), the new IAU standards could no longer allow the Kuiper Belt object to be considered a full-fledged planet, so it was demoted to dwarf planet status.\n\nThere are some people who say that, under the new IAU definition, even our own planet, Earth, is a dwarf.\n\nInvestigators led by Philip Metzger, a planetary scientist with the Florida Space Institute at the University of Central Florida, in Orlando, Florida, claim that the reason for Pluto\u2019s demotion was not valid.\n\nSo they went through and analyzed 200 years\u2019 worth of scientific literature to prove their point.\n\nAfter reviewing the various publications, they say only one publication, from 1802, used the \u201cclear-orbit\u201d requirement to classify planets and that was later found to be based on disproven reasoning.\n\nThe researchers documented their findings in a new study that was recently published online in the journal Icarus.\n\n\u201cThe IAU definition would say that the fundamental object of planetary science, the planet, is supposed to be a defined on the basis of a concept that nobody uses in their research,\u201d says Metzger in a university press release. \u201cAnd it would leave out the second-most complex, interesting planet in our solar system,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Florida researchers say what defines a planet should be based on its own fundamental properties, rather than variables such as the dynamics of its orbit.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Pluto be reclassified and regain its planet status?",

The game opened my eyes to realize that whatever I wanted to do through medicine, I can do it faster through sports.\u201d\n\nFall credits African players like Mutombo, Hakeem \u201cThe Dream\u201d Olajuwon and Luol Deng with helping fuel the dreams and aspirations of a whole new generation of young players on the continent.\n\nJoel Embiid and Pascal Siakam are two young Cameroonian players who will compete in the NBA Africa Game 2018 on August 4.\n\nThe 24-year-old Embiid, a center for the Philadelphia 76ers, earned his first NBA all-star selection last season after going to the Basketball Without Borders Africa camp in 2011.\n\nAnd the 24-year-old Siakam, a forward for the Toronto Raptors, went to the Basketball Without Borders Africa camp in 2012.\n\nThe campers at Basketball Without Borders Africa 2018 will be trying to improve not just their basketball skills, but also their life skills.\n\nThere will be seminars on such topics as leadership, gender equity, character development and HIV/AIDS prevention.",

  "text": "I\u2019m looking forward to returning to South Africa where I\u2019ll be covering Basketball Without Borders Africa activities and the NBA Africa Game 2018.\n\nThis will be my second trip to South Africa.\n\nI traveled to the country eight years ago for coverage of the FIFA World Cup football tournament.\n\nThe NBA Africa Game 2018 will be played Saturday, August 4, at Sun Arena in Pretoria.\n\nThis will be the NBA\u2019s third in game in Africa, and it will once again feature a Team Africa versus Team World format.\n\nThe game will be played in support of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, and it also will honor the 100th anniversary of the birth of South Africa\u2019s former President and Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nI remember being inside a chilly Soccer City Stadium when Nelson Mandela waved to more than 84,000 fans attending the Spain versus Netherlands World Cup final.\n\nIt was a warm and special moment, and the last public appearance by the anti-apartheid icon.\n\nNelson Mandela was a big sports fan, and I think if he were alive today, he might attend the NBA Africa Game 2018.\n\nThe NBA says there are more than 80 current and former NBA players from Africa, or with direct family ties to the continent, including Hall of Famers Hakeem \u201cThe Dream\u201d Olajuwon, who is from Nigeria, and Dikembe Mutombo, who is from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMutombo is planning to attend the NBA Africa Game 2018, and so is another big man who left a big imprint on basketball, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer.\n\nThe NBA says league Commissioner Adam Silver will also participate in the game, as will Masai Ujiri, a 48-year-old Nigerian who is President of the NBA\u2019s Toronto Raptors team.\n\nTeam Africa includes 24-year-old Cameroonian Joel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers center who earned his first all-star selection last season.\n\nAlso on Team Africa are Luol Deng (Los Angeles Lakers; South Sudan), Bismack Biyombo (Charlotte Hornets; Democratic Republic of the Congo), Cheick Diallo (New Orleans Pelicans; Mali) and Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors; Cameroon), among others.\n\nThe 24-year-old Siakam was drafted by the Raptors in 2016, four years after participating in a Basketball Without Borders (BWB) Africa camp.\n\nSince 2003, the NBA, in partnership with FIBA, has hosted the BWB camps for young basketball players.\n\nIn addition to teaching basketball skills, the clinics promote leadership, education, sportsmanship and healthy living.\n\nThis will be the 16th edition of Basketball Without Borders Africa.",

  "text": "A new bill making its way through the U.S. Congress proposes to arm consumers with information about the privacy and security risks of connected devices. The move comes as some industry experts and privacy advocates are raising concerns about a flood of everyday items on the market that are connected to the internet.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, dubbed the \u201cIOT Consumer TIPS Act,\u201d instructs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop cybersecurity resources for consumers to protect themselves against cybercriminals when using Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as thermostats, cameras, or digital assistants that are always connected to the internet via Wi-Fi networks.\n\nAccording to the bill, the FTC has to provide within a year voluntary educational material that cites consumer attitudes and expectations and advises on device setup, passwords, recovery in case of hacking, and \u201cend of life considerations such as resetting, deleting, or modifying data collected or retained by a covered device when it is no longer in use or expected to be used by the consumer.\u201d\n\nAndrei Petrus, IoT director with cybersecurity firm Avira, applauded the bill as a good, first step toward raising consumer awareness and setting industry standards. Once users are more educated, they will have some sort of benchmark to consult for their next IoT device.\n\nHe urged legislators to \u201cenable a solid, sane framework\u201d to preset and then handle security credentials on IoT products after their sale.\n\n\u201cA significant number of smart devices, including smart CCTV cameras, thermostats or smart TVs, are insecure by design,\u201d said Petrus. \u201cIt\u2019s not even possible to make some of them more secure as they\u2019ve been made with hard-coded account names and passwords that can\u2019t be changed.\u201d\n\nHard-coded features are built into the hardware or software code so that they can\u2019t be modified. The approach, added Petrus, \u201ctransforms \u2018security\u2019 into a big vulnerability just waiting to be exploited\u201d by hackers who could compromise the network and take over the device.\n\nIn an effort to rush their products to market, some IoT manufacturers and vendors overlook security due to lack of expertise or the desire to keep costs down, said Petrus. And there are cases where vendors skip asking users to change default passwords, a basic security measure.\n\nSecuring every device is critical. The entire network has to be secured, he said, including \u201call smart devices at the gateway.\u201d\n\nBesides security concerns, there are questions surrounding privacy that not all privacy policies answer clearly. Do these devices listen in all the time in people\u2019s homes or just respond to key commands? How much information do they collect and for how long? And who owns that information. Can it be sold?\n\nIoT devices are \u201calways listening at some level,\u201d said Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for internet rights at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Unless the vendor is forthcoming, he said it is very hard for ordinary people \u201cto really know what it is you are subjecting yourself to in terms of information capture.\u201d\n\nThe maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner, iRobot, for example, went into damage control a few months ago after revelations it was planning to sell the map data the Roomba collected inside people\u2019s homes (without permission) to third parties. CEO Colin Angle later said this would never happen.\n\nAlways-on connected devices take data-collection to a whole new level, said Tien.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, I knew for certain that my phone was collecting data but I didn\u2019t worry about my TV requesting data,\u201d he said. \u201cAll sorts of formerly-mute appliances are now talking appliances and we do not know what they are talking about.\u201d\n\nWhile marketers and vendors can learn a lot about consumer behavior from data collection, Petrus cautioned that the practice puts users at risk.\n\n\u201cMining the usage data we leave behind with smart TVs,\u201d he added, \u201ccan tell a lot about user\u2019s political sympathies, movies or music genre preferences, who\u2019s at home, when, what other Internet connected devices we have at home.\u201d\n\nThese concerns are discouraging faster adoption of IoT devices, he said. But as the market matures, he expects consumers to force manufacturers to negotiate a way to create cheap, smart devices that are also secure.\n\nAnd this has to begin with the original concept, said Tien. If connected devices are the future, will they be designed for the next decade? Will they be too complex to be figured out by ordinary users? Or will they have features that let users flip a switch to control and stop data collection? Will users actually know what the device is doing?\n\n\u201cWhat we have an ability to do, shape, or try to shape are the social norms around the technology,\u201d he said.",

  "url": "http://blogs.voanews.com/techtonics/2017/11/17/even-after-death-social-media-still-connects-loved-ones/",
  "text": "Social media is turning into a vast graveyard for profiles of owners who have passed away, leaving them unattended or as standing memorials. And some experts are urging social networks to do more to help users prepare for their digital deaths.\n\nThere are millions of them \u2013 pages that remain on social media sites, and in some cases, automatically update after their owners\u2019 death.\n\nThe numbers vary from 5 million to as many as 300 million, according to Jed Brubaker, a digital death expert with the University of Colorado, Boulder. But it\u2019s hard to know the exact numbers because \u201ctracking the rate of death across the world is hard,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook, in particular, has millions of dead profiles that could overtake those of the living by the latter half of the century, if the social media giant fails to grow its user base further.\n\n\u201cThis of course presumes that \u2026 what Facebook will look like 20 years from now is what it looks like right now in 2017,\u201d Brubaker noted.\n\nSocial media was developed as a place for people to connect with friends, family and colleagues. And Brubaker\u2019s research shows this continues to be the case even after people have died.\n\n\u201cWe turn to social media profiles as a way to remember, to reflect on the memories of loved ones, or to remain connected to them and remind ourselves of who or what they meant to us while they were alive,\u201d he said.\n\nBut unlike funerals, typically attended by relatives, friends, and acquaintances, social media breaks down space and time barriers. A post about someone\u2019s death reaches friends and strangers around the world. Sometimes people don\u2019t see it until months later as it gets buried under a deluge of information.\n\nFacebook alone shares up to 4.7 billion pieces of content daily, according to Ken Huening, founder of MiLegacy, a media archive service. When something is posted in the morning, \u201cif you don\u2019t look on your Facebook [account] until later in the evening,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to scroll through a number of different top topics and various different people\u201d to find what you are looking for.\n\n\u201cPeople get information about death the way they might learn about \u201cthe latest political update or shoot viral cat videos,\u201d said Brubaker. \u201cAnd this is in contrast to what we historically might have thought of as a fellow picking up the phone and calling you, and learning about it in a more intimate and supportive conversation.\u201d\n\nSome death studies experts, noted Brubaker, argue that social media is \u201crepositioning\u201d death back into everyday practices as a way to keep information about ancestors present for reflection.\n\nThese are memories and photographs that often are tucked away in physical scrapbooks and photo albums. And they are the things people risk their lives to save when disaster strikes.\n\nBut in a world that increasingly digitizes everyday life, these prized possessions are now on smartphones, social media sites, and cloud servers. When they disappear, then \u201cwhat we\u2019re losing is actually all the photos that maybe ever existed of those people,\u201d said Brubaker.\n\nYet his research shows that people tend to de-prioritize non-material things, so they defer making decisions about the fate of their digital assets. At the same time, when asked about the experiences they\u2019ve had with loved ones and their digital memories, people spoke about \u201cthe immense, incredible importance of those spaces,\u201d he said.\n\nServices like MiLegacy are filling the gap. Registered users can upload the memories they have on their phones to their profiles, where they can curate them and share them with trusted contacts. And with the \u201ctime capsule\u201d feature, users can leave audio and written messages for their children and grandchildren \u201cthat will post in the future,\u201d said Huening.\n\nThese types of services are relatively new. Some, like MiLegacy, let people save their digital credentials to pass on after their death to designated caretakers. The process takes away \u201cfrom having to go through a whole legal process,\u201d he said.\n\nBrubaker said social media services also should do more to help people decide the fate of their digital profiles. And he has been working to reconcile the living and the dead on social media by figuring out \u201chow postmortem data and how our digital legacies can inform our lives today and encourage us to be more reflective.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an irony with social media,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re so bent on capturing our social lives that maybe we need to pay a little more attention or at least build up the policies or tools to let users make their own choices for what is inevitably one of the most important social things that will ever happen to us, which is our death.\u201d",

  "text": "Voice-enabled devices have the potential to unlock a world of information for illiterate populations around the world. But certain needs have to be met before voice recognition can significantly impact literacy, says a leading education technology expert.\n\n\u201cThere is so much going on where you need to be literate,\u201d said Michael Trucano, the World Bank\u2019s senior education and technology policy specialist.\n\nOne issue is that the world, particularly in developing regions, is full of printed content \u2013 documents that need to be written or signed, and vital information about health and well-being that needs to be read. For 780 million non-literate people in the world, the inability to do any of these things is a huge impediment.\n\nBut voice recognition technologies can be a potential bridge to promote literacy, Trucano said. One example is the subtitling of karaoke or movies in India.\n\nSmall pieces, big picture\n\nWorking with local partners, PlanetRead uses eye-tracking and karaoke-style subtitles to push literacy through a sound-to-text system. As people watch television, they see the lyrics of music videos and film songs displayed on the screen in the same language as the audio.\n\nCalled \u201cSame Language Subtitling,\u201d the approach strengthens correspondence among weak and struggling readers by \u201cintegrating perfectly matching text into their film song viewing,\u201d the organization said.\n\nThe subtitling \u201cgives automatic and inescapable reading practice to millions of viewers,\u201d said \u200bPlanetRead founder Brij Kothari. It\u2019s \u201ckaraoke on existing Bollywood content on TV for everyday and lifelong reading practice.\u201d\n\nA different approach is taking place in Ghana, in regions with few resources and low literacy levels. Using a low-cost audio computer called the Talking Book, the Literacy Bridge, a nonprofit group, disseminates information to users about health, agriculture, and education \u201cin their own dialect,\u201d said the group\u2019s executive director, Cliff Schmidt.\n\nUsers also record their own messages and feedback, thereby creating their own digital content in areas where there is none.\n\nWhile promising, these low-cost interventions yield \u201cmarginal and diffuse\u201d literacy gains, said Trucano of the World Bank. They are, however, pieces of a much larger \u201cliteracy, low literacy, illiteracy challenge.\u201d Paired with voice recognition, they could spur people to increase their literacy skills.\n\n\u201cThese will be important building blocks of many of the illiteracy efforts that we\u2019re going to see,\u201d he said.",

Cet enfant guin\u00e9en est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le patient z\u00e9ro de ce qui va devenir la plus grave \u00e9pid\u00e9mie d\u2019Ebola de l\u2019histoire. Sa famille et tout le village de M\u00e9liandou ne le savent pas encore. C\u2019est Augustin Mamadouno, chef du poste m\u00e9dical dans cette partie de la pr\u00e9fecture de Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, qui examine l\u2019enfant malade.\n\n\u201cIls \u00e9taient venus pour une simple consultation car l\u2019enfant avait beaucoup de fi\u00e8vre. On l\u2019a trait\u00e9 pour le paludisme, mais au bout de trois jours, l\u2019enfant a rendu l\u2019\u00e2me\u201c, se souvient M.Mamadouno au micro de VOA Afrique.\n\nAugustin Mamadouno est le chef du poste m\u00e9dical de M\u00e9liandou (Z.Camara/VOA)\n\nEn effet, Emile meurt le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Quelques jours plus tard, c\u2019est au tour de sa grande s\u0153ur Philom\u00e8ne. Les sympt\u00f4mes sont les m\u00eames : fi\u00e8vre, naus\u00e9es, frissons et des h\u00e9morragies internes et externes. Dans le village on s\u2019interroge, Qui a jet\u00e9 un sort sur la famille Ouamouno ?\n\nLa panique gagne le village quand le responsable du poste m\u00e9dical ordonne l\u2019\u00e9vacuation de la grand-m\u00e8re d\u2019Emile. Deux jours apr\u00e8s son admission \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, la vieille dame meurt sous les yeux de ses trois filles.\n\nEtienne Ouamouno est le p\u00e8re du petit Emile, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme la premi\u00e8re victime de cette \u00e9pid\u00e9mie d\u2019Ebola (Z.Camara/VOA)\n\nTrois ans apr\u00e8s cette trag\u00e9die, VOA Afrique a retrouv\u00e9 le p\u00e8re du petit Emile. Etienne Ouamouno se souvient qu\u2019avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son fils, Emile \u201ca pass\u00e9 quelques jours de traitement chez le gu\u00e9risseur du village en compagnie d\u2019une dame malade en provenance de la Sierra L\u00e9one. C\u2019est parce que j'aimais mon fils que je ne voulais pas le voir aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de cette dame malade.\u201c.\n\nAujourd\u2019hui, son p\u00e8re est persuad\u00e9 que cette dame est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la contamination.\n\nUne crise sanitaire hors de contr\u00f4le\n\nAvec 28 636 cas et 11 315 morts (bilan en janvier 2016, selon l\u2019OMS), les sp\u00e9cialistes du virus tueur se demandent encore comment a-t-on pu en arriver l\u00e0. Sur les bords du Lac L\u00e9man, \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve, Joanne Liu se souvient parfaitement de ce jour de mars 2014 o\u00f9 MSF publia un communiqu\u00e9 rageur pour demander au monde d\u2019agir face \u00e0 une \u00e9pid\u00e9mie d\u2019Ebola \u201cd\u2019une magnitude sans pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent.\u201c\n\nJoanne Liu est la pr\u00e9sidente de M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res (N.Pinault/VOA)\n\nDeux ans plus tard, la pr\u00e9sidente de l\u2019ONG se confie \u00e0 VOA Afrique : \u201cJusque-l\u00e0, la plus grande \u00e9pid\u00e9mie d\u2019Ebola jamais connue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 celle de l\u2019an 2000 en Ouganda o\u00f9 425 personnes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 infect\u00e9es.

C\u2019\u00e9tait le premier signal que quelque chose de diff\u00e9rent se passait. MSF est une organisation qui travaille sur la fi\u00e8vre h\u00e9morragique depuis des ann\u00e9es et qui en tire un savoir-faire que peu d\u2019autres organisations ont. Je ne les bl\u00e2me pas.

  "text": "Curiosity is Susan Orlean\u2019s superpower.\n\nHundreds of L.A. firefighters fought the devastating fire.at downtown\u2019s Central Library on April 29, 1986. Thousands of people contributed to the Save the Books campaign afterward. Millions heard the news that the library was burning and then that it was caused by arson. But more than three decades later, only Orlean was asking who did it and why, and wonderingwhether anyone today should care. In a reverse \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d Orlean took a fire and turned it into a book.\n\nTitled \u2014 aptly and ingeniously \u2014 \u201cThe Library Book,\u201d it tells the story of the mysterious fire that burned 400,000 books while also tracing Orlean\u2019s love of libraries, from trips with her mother to taking her son. Along the way, she relates the unexpectedly colorful history and future of the L.A. Public Library.\n\n\u201cMy first interest was writing a book about the day-to-day life of a big city library. I could have done that anywhere,\u201d she said over lunch after we visited the library together. \u201cI liked the idea of doing it in L.A., out of this contrarian idea that people don't associate libraries with L.A., which made it kind of delectable.\u201d\n\nThat said, the 1986 fire (forgive me) was the spark.\n\nA longtime staff writer for the New Yorker, Orlean had begun living in Los Angeles part of the year (she and her husband also maintain a home in New York). While exploring the city\u2019s institutions, she visited the flagship of the L.A. Public Library and learned of its catastrophic fire. Although no people were seriously injured, the fire destroyed 400,000 books and damaged 700,000 more, causing $22 million in damages \u2014 more than $50 million today. It remains the largest library fire ever in America.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing story,\u201d she said. As we walked through the library, Orlean \u2014 petite, stylish and with electric auburn hair \u2014 was greeted by staffers she\u2019d gotten to know during her research.\n\nTapping a concrete wall, she explained where the fire had started, in the stacks. Built as two secure concrete chutes within the original 1926 building, the stacks held hundreds of thousands of books and were connected by a catwalk for librarians. After the fire started \u2014 leaping across the catwalk from the first stack to the second \u2014 the chutes served as dual furnaces, books trapped inside with the fire.\n\n\u201cTheir covers burst like popcorn. Pages flared and blackened and then sprang away from their bindings, a ream of sooty scraps soaring on the updraft. The fire flashed through fiction, consuming it as it traveled,\u201d Orlean writes in her book. \u201cIt reached for the cookbooks. The cookbooks burned up. The fire scrambled to the sixth tier and then to the seventh. Every book in its path bloomed with flame.\u201d\n\nIf you, like me, care about books, reading her brilliant, awful description of the conflagration feels like watching a snuff film.\n\nWreckage after the fire in L.A.'s Central Library. Larry Bessel / Los Angeles Times\n\nOrlean agrees. \u201cThere's something that we feel deeply about books that we don't feel about other objects \u2014 you know, it\u2019s an object!\u201d It was as if she were trying to convince herself. \u201cAnd nowadays, it's an object that can be replaced pretty easily. Even so. There is something about it that feels raw and vicious and aggressive.\u201d\n\nShe is a lifelong journalist, known for her careful, in-person research, showcased in her New Yorker pieces and books, including \u201cRin Tin Tin,\u201d a history of the Hollywood dog; \u201cThe Bullfighter Checks Her Makeup\u201d; and (despite Charlie Kaufman\u2019s fabrications in \u201cAdaptation\u201d) \u201cThe Orchid Thief.\u201d So I was surprised to hear what she said next. It was so mystical.\n\n\u201cI think we have some association with books that feels like there was a soul in there,\u201d Orlean said. \u201cThat there's a being in there, whether it's because writers have poured themselves onto the pages, whatever it is, I think there's something ineffable, mysterious about what makes books special, and I'm glad of that.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the underlying ideas of \u201cThe Library Book\u201d \u2014 that books, as both objects and ideas, are essential to the human project; that libraries are a vital destination that holds them safe.\n\nSo who would want to torch one?\n\nThat was a question L.A. authorities thought they had answered on Feb. 27, 1987, when they arrested 28-year-old Harry Peak on suspicion of arson. Peak was released three days later after the district attorney declined to file charges against him.\n\nIt is a fine mystery: Fire officials said there was an arsonist; Peak claimed, then disavowed, responsibility for the fire; no one else has ever been arrested in connection with the blaze. Whether Peak was the actual culprit is one of the central questions of Orlean\u2019s book.\n\nHarry Peak emerges into the glare of TV lights after being released from jail on Mar. 2, 1987. Jack Gaunt / Los Angeles Times\n\nOrlean describes Peak as \u201cthe consummate storyteller.\u201d Handsome and underemployed, he was a little bit rootless and quite a big talker; some news reports called him a part-time actor. He matched a sketch of the suspect. According to some (but not all) accounts, he was downtown at the time.\n\n\u201cThere were two big storytellers in the book,\u201d Orlean tells me. \u201cOne was Harry Peak and the other was Charles Lummis, who was an incredibly admirable and important figure in the history of LA.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an unexpected pairing. Lummis was the first city editor of the L.A. Times and founded the Southwest Museum; more pertinent to this story, he was also L.A.\u2019s city librarian, a tenure Orlean details in the book. His hand-built stone home, which is now a museum on the southern edge of Highland Park, was known for the rowdy parties \u2014 he called them \u201cnoises\u201d \u2014 he threw there. By any measure, Lummis was a significant figure in the history of Los Angeles, while Peak, apart from being the arson suspect, passed through barely leaving a mark. But, Orlean says, Lummis \u201cwas a bit of a fabulist, and he would tell stories that his friends didn't always believe.\u201d So did Peak.\n\n\u201cWe tell stories to ourselves, to each other,\u201d Orlean says, as though forgiving the fabricators. \u201cIt's the lifeblood of being human.\u201d\n\nSusan Orlean at L.A.'s Central Library. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nPerhaps she is sympathetic to the tale-spinners, because to be a writer in 2018 means to side with art. Right now, looking at this, you could Google \u201cHarry Peak\u201d or \u201clibrary fire\u201d and easily read the nuggets the internet spits out at you. Orlean\u2019s project is bigger. It has to be.\n\n\u201cI think that one of the great burdens of being a nonfiction writer is this feeling that anybody could go look this stuff up,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not delivering any information that no one else can access. I've gone on a trip to the pyramids and you're sitting around the dinner table and people say, \u2018How was your trip? What were the pyramids like?\u2019 Well, they could go look it up online, but that's not the point.\u201d\n\nPyramids in Egypt or a 32-year-old news story in Los Angeles, the point is elevating the narrative so it tells us something about ourselves or the world, making it something worth noticing. \u201cThe history of the library is fascinating, and reminding people that libraries are kind of cool and interesting is exciting,\u201d Orlean said. \u201cI got very charged up about it.\u201d\n\nFire Capt. Don Stukey examining the damage after the 1986 fire, which was determined to be arson. Boris Yaro / Los Angeles Times\n\nShe admits that editors are rarely convinced by her story ideas on the surface. \u201cThere is some kind of pleasure that I find in saying, \u2018I know you think that this couldn't possibly be interesting, but it really is. Give me a minute, I'll persuade you.\u2019 That awareness that I'm having to prove to people every sentence of the way that this is something worth their time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, this is super interesting. No, no, wait, wait, no. There's more,\u201d she demonstrated. \u201cAnd then there's more, and you're not going to believe. That's how it feels to me, that I'm tugging on somebody\u2019s sleeve saying, \u2018Wait, wait, one more second. Let me just tell you one more thing, you're not going to believe it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom where we sat at lunch, we could see the library building. I asked our server if she knew that it was the site of the biggest library fire in American history. She didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cOoh, I just got the chills,\u201d the server said. She turned to Orlean. \u201cAnd you wrote a book about it? What\u2019s it called? What caused the fire?\u201d\n\nFor generations of Angelenos, this will be the first they\u2019ve heard of the fire, the massive fight to contain it, the thousands of books frozen in an effort to preserve them, the water damage, the stop-start effort to restore and expand the library where its visionary architect put it at the corner of 5th and Flower in downtown Los Angeles, of the man who may have set it aflame, maybe even of libraries around the world destroyed by fire through the ages, taking untold stories with them.\n\nIt\u2019s all there. They just have to borrow \u201cThe Library Book.\u201d\n\nSusan Orlean inside the Los Angeles Central Library.

  "text": "In other parts of the country, spring is when gardeners go into a planting frenzy. But here in California, fall is the best time to plant. This is when the soil is still warm, but the air is cool. Cooler air reduces heat stress, and warm soil encourages rapid root growth. And with any luck, Mother Nature will help keep the soil damp all the way through next spring.\n\nIf it\u2019s still hot weather for the first week or two of October, put your planting on hold. But once the heat abates, get ready, get set and start planting. Here are 24 ideas to get you inspired:\n\n1. Plant just about any tree, shrub, perennial, vine or succulent that is native to our sister climates of southwestern and western South Africa, Australia, the west coast of Chile, and the Mediterranean coast. Also, this month is still warm enough to plant tropicals like banana, citrus, avocado or guava.\n\n2. Before you plant, be sure your garden has a solid infrastructure: Grade the property so water flows away from the house and into planting beds or bioswales, so water remains on site.\n\n3. If your garden is heavy clay soil, create large planting mounds of well-draining soil to plant into. A mix of 30% organic matter to 79% inorganic soil is a good starting point for all California natives and other Mediterranean climate plants.\n\n4. Set up an in-line drip irrigation system (not the individual emitter style drip), and install an automatic irrigation controller.\n\nSet up an in-line drip irrigation system (not the individual emitter style drip), and install an automatic irrigation controller. itman__47 / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n5. Prepare for planting: Water the plant in its pot and let it drain for an hour or so. Then gently pull the plant out of its pot so you can see the rootball. Dig a hole as deep as the rootball is tall, and slightly wider. Experts recommend making squared-off holes with roughed up edges. This shape encourages roots to grow beyond the hole rather than circling around and around. Add a few handfuls of worm castings to the hole but no other amendments. Fill the hole with water and let it drain.\n\n6. Once the plant is out of the container, carefully loosen the roots (except for bougainvillea or Matilija poppy, Romneya coulteri). Set the plant into the hole, just barely higher than the plant was in the pot (it will settle). Refill the hole with soil, wetting the soil and tamping it down as you go to eliminate air pockets. Once the planting hole is full, make a watering basin \u2014 basically a moat \u2014 around the stem or trunk. Set your hose to trickle water into the basin until the soil is saturated. Layer 3 or 4 inches of mulch onto the soil surface, starting at the outer edges of the basin and covering the entire planting bed.\n\n7. Fall is a great time to renew your garden\u2019s mulch. Organic mulch \u2014 that\u2019s mulch made from leaves, bark, wood, etc. \u2014 acts as a sponge to hold water; it keeps moisture in the soil; it protects soil from erosion; and, as mulch breaks down, feeds the micro flora and fauna that help build healthy soils to support plants. Mulch should cover nearly all the soil surfaces in your garden, but do leave some large bare spots for our native, ground-dwelling bees. They are important garden pollinators.\n\n8. With the sun lower in the sky, plants slow down and need less water.\n\n9. Adjust your irrigation clock to water less often. If you have a smart irrigation controller, see if it is making the necessary adjustments on its own.\n\n10. Do you know how long to water? Plants take up water from their roots, so water long enough to get the water that deep. Five minutes isn\u2019t enough, and neither is 15 minutes if you are using drip irrigation. Use a soil probe and pull up a narrow core of garden soil. With a soil probe, it is easy to see how wet or dry the soil is, from the surface, down to a foot or more. Adjust your watering schedule so water reaches the deep roots every time, and then gets to dry down before you water again. How often you water should change with the seasons, but how long you water should always stay the same.\n\n11. Watch for spring bulbs like Watsonia, Narcissus and Babiana to pop up their green spears now. If you have bulbs that didn\u2019t get planted, go ahead and plant them now. They may not flower next spring, but they should flower their second spring in the ground.\n\n12. Plant seeds for spring-blooming California poppies now. Try your hand at the common and beautiful sunny orange California poppies (Eschscholzia californica), the diminutive, yellow-flowered foothill poppy (Eschscholzia caespitosa) or red-orange wind poppies (Papaver heterophyllum).\n\nTime to harvest pumpkins. Marcia Straub / Getty Images\n\n13. Harvest the last of the melons, pumpkins and winter squash when the stems turn brown and separate from the base easily. Leave a few inches of stem attached as a handle. Store in a cool, dry, dark location.\n\n14. Divide iris plants. Carefully separate the rhizomes (they look like tiny, jointed potatoes) and replant or share with friends. Use a sharp knife wiped clean with alcohol. If you divide more than one iris plant, wipe the knife with alcohol between plants to avoid spreading any pests or diseases.\n\n15. Plant sweet pea seeds \u2014 the flowering kind \u2014 this month and next for a spring of color and fragrance.\n\n16. Trim branches of scented geraniums and Martha Washington geraniums early in the month. In another month, you\u2019ll cut off the long branches to force plants to grow new shoots at their bases, but for now, just shorten the branches by a couple of inches.\n\n17. It\u2019s time to switch to cool-season vegetables including greens, late-season beans, onions, peas, kohl rabi, broccoli and cauliflower. Plant these from seed or from seedlings.\n\n18. This is the time of year when vegetable gardeners face a dilemma. Should we pull out our tomatoes, eggplants, peppers and squashes that are near the end but still producing so we can plant cabbage, kale and spinach? Or should we leave them in the ground and wait another month to plant the cool-season crops? Hmmm.\n\n19. Grow root vegetables from seed in the garden, since they don\u2019t transplant well: carrots, beets, radishes, turnips, rutabagas, etc.\n\n20. Start an herb garden. Plant permanent herbs like rosemary, oregano and bay in the ground. Plant annuals like cilantro, dill and parsley into large pots or raised vegetable beds. It\u2019s too late, though, to plant more annual basil this year.\n\n21. Consider cover crops. They help replenish your vegetable gardens\u2019 nutrients and add organic matter. The best cover crops are mixes of legumes for nitrogen with grains for organic matter. Mustard helps dampen down soil pathogens like fungi and nematodes. Order cover crop seeds now.\n\n22. Protect next year\u2019s fruit and vegetable crops by cleaning up planting areas and sending debris off in the green waste instead of composting it at home. At the greenery, they\u2019ll be hot composted to kill off pests and diseases.\n\n23. Feed roses with liquid fertilizer at midmonth. Inspect leaves for mold or rust or black spot. Pull or cut off infected leaves and put them into the green-waste bin rather than into your compost pile.\n\n24. Clean drains and rain gutters before the (hopefully) rainy season begins in earnest.",

So lawmakers allowed owners to pay a fee instead \u2014 with the money going toward a ranch-wide route to be built by the state \u201cas expeditiously as possible.\u201d\n\nBut decades later, no one has held up that end of the bargain.\n\nThe fees? Still sitting in the bank \u2014 and amounting to a lot less than the state envisioned.\n\nThe path to the beach promised to the public? Still just a promise.\n\nThe standoff continues to this day, with some of California\u2019s most-coveted beaches and surf breaks closed off to everyone but landowners, their guests, select groups and those strong enough to paddle in through treacherous waters. Coastal officials faced public backlash this year when they gave up a key fight by agreeing to ocean-only access.\n\nWith renewed public pressure to open Hollister Ranch once and for all, many have dusted off old records and reexamined the special provision of the Coastal Act on page 110, part (b) of section 30610.8.\n\nWhile other property owners up and down the coast have over the decades been forced to play by the rules, how did 8.5 miles of coastline manage to remain so private \u2014 and with so little scrutiny \u2014 for more than 36 years?\n\nRanchers had the money to continue a legal fight in perpetuity. They had the defense that nature, under their private stewardship, has thrived. And as the legislative history faded from memory, the political will to bring about change petered out.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had a handful of extremely wealthy, powerful people who have doggedly fought and delayed access at every turn. \u2026 They have lobbied in Sacramento, and they have bought the best lawyers that money can buy,\u201d Coastal Commissioner Aaron Peskin said. \u201cBut because of the public outcry and all the attention, everything has now bubbled to the surface.\u201d\n\nPristine coastline on Hollister Ranch. Tamlorn Chase / For The Times\n\nThe long standoff\n\nInitiated by voters and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in his first term, the 1976 Coastal Act was a response to unregulated shoreline development. Almost immediately after its passage, beachfront owners and interest groups across the state began jostling to amend or repeal sections of the law.\n\nAt Hollister Ranch, where a dozen owners could jointly own one of the subdivision\u2019s 136 parcels, enforcing access rules proved particularly complicated. Property owners challenged this in court, saying that individual lot owners were unable to each provide a public accessway because the common roads were controlled by a third party \u2014 the Hollister Ranch Owners Assn.\n\nThe litigation pressed on, keeping landowners from developing their properties and the public from accessing the coast. The Legislature, in an attempt to resolve the standoff, added in 1979 a special section to the Coastal Act: Rather than require public access be provided parcel by parcel, permit by permit, owners could pay an \u201cin-lieu\u201d fee that would fund a public beach access program for the whole ranch.\n\nDocument \"Every person receiving a coastal development permit or a certificate of exemption for development on any vacant lot within an area designated pursuant to this section shall ... pay to the commission, for deposit in the Coastal Access Account, an 'in-lieu' public access fee.\" \u2014 California Coastal Act see the document\n\nBut landowners resisted, according to public records, and blocked state surveyors from appraising the parcels needed to create the public path.\n\nCoastal officials, using what site data they could gather, created in 1981 the Hollister Ranch Coastal Access Program. The plan included a walking trail and bicycle lane that would run parallel to the ranch\u2019s main private road. To minimize the number of cars \u2014 in the interest of privacy and environmental protection \u2014 a bus would operate from nearby Gaviota State Park to six Hollister beaches, where there would be campsites and bathrooms.\n\nRead the Hollister Ranch coastal access plan \u00bb\n\nStill facing pushback, officials agreed in 1982 to implement the plan in three phases. The proposed campsites were removed. A cap was also set on the number of people allowed on the ranch each day, beginning with 100 people in phase one and a maximum of 500 in phase three.\n\nBut Hollister kept fighting, with the standoff now over the cost of the in-lieu fee. So the Legislature stepped in again and added another section to the Coastal Act, fixing the fee at \u201c$5,000 for each permit\u201d until the appraisal was completed and an official fee could be established.\n\nDocument \"... with respect to the Hollister Ranch public access program, the in-lieu fee shall be five thousands dollars ($5,000) for each permit.\" \u2014 California Coastal Act see the document\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the Coastal Conservancy will be loaned $500,000 \u2026 so that work can begin immediately on the access program,\u201d according to a legislative memo explaining each section of the 1982 bill. \u201cThe entire $500,000 will be repaid as individual fees are collected.\u201d\n\nDocument \"Each of the 100 property owners will contribute $5000 to the access program when applying for a permit to develop his/her property... In the meantime, the Coastal Conservancy will be loaned $500,000... so that work can begin immediately on the access program. ... The entire $500,000 will be repaid as individual fees are collected.\" \u2014 AB 321 (1982) see the document\n\nBut as Gov. Brown left office and Gov. George Deukmejian came in, the push to open Hollister lost steam. The attorney general in 1983 obtained a court order authorizing state officials to enter Hollister Ranch and complete the appraisal, but records show no evidence it took place. Other records show almost half of the $500,000 loan was spent on the fight to survey the land.\n\nDeukmejian, who was in office from 1983 to 1991, sought to dismantle the Coastal Commission, which he viewed as a barrier to local control of development. The Legislature passed a few bills that would have given coastal officials more authority to carry out the Hollister access plan \u2014 he vetoed them all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the momentum really hit the wall in terms of access at Hollister,\u201d Sarah Christie, the commission\u2019s legislative director, said during a recent meeting. \u201cThe governor reduced our budget by 50%, we laid off half of our staff \u2014 so as you can imagine, the Coastal Commission itself got diverted in terms of its priorities on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental purity\n\nAs other access battles took center stage and Hollister faded from institutional memory, the ranch remained a private oasis. Owners have long contended that letting the public in could spoil the ranch\u2019s coastline and undo years of effort to protect the land. They point to the temporary access that they already grant to scientists, academics, historical societies, environmental groups and schoolchildren.\n\nOver the years, this stance as private caretakers of the environment won the support from some members of the community. For a time, it even helped Hollister escape scrutiny by some of the state\u2019s fiercest coastal advocates who until recently had focused their access battles elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI never really questioned it. I just accepted that they\u2019ve always turned people away,\u201d said Susan Jordan of the California Coastal Protection Network, who is now fighting for greater access with a coalition of advocacy groups through a court intervention. \u201cEveryone here had just accepted that Hollister was an exclusive fiefdom of environmental purity.\u201d\n\nRead more: Coastal advocates challenge deal that bars public from reaching Hollister Ranch by land \u00bb\n\nJohn Schleuss / Los Angeles Times\n\nCarter Ohlmann, a research oceanographer at UC Santa Barbara, supports the environmental protection. He points to the high biodiversity that has thrived at Hollister without heavy human interruption.\n\nAnthony Friedkin, a photographer who has visited the ranch since the 1960s, said that it makes him sad that the ranchers are \u201cgetting portrayed as these evil rich elitists.\u201d Yes, some are wealthy, he said, \u201cbut to their credit they have been exceptional guardians of this exceptional land.\u201d\n\nHe still recalls the first time he stepped onto Hollister \u2014 it felt spiritual, with packs of butterflies and wildlife that roamed free.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you how overwhelmingly magnificent this land is, and it really deserves to be left alone and preserved,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many beautiful beaches that the public can access in the area. Why not let this small stretch of land be without pavement, without parking lots, restrooms, trash and crowds so thick you can smell the sunscreen in the air?\u201d\n\nA young buck scrambles into the hills along Hollister Ranch Road. Landowners have long contended that letting the public in could undo years of effort to protect the environment. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nIn a history book published by the Hollister Ranch Conservancy, its authors explained that the ranch \u201crepresents a concept of land development that is a model for both landowners and environmentalists \u2014 allowing very limited development and achieving conservation of habitat and resources, and sharing those resources for education and science \u2026 while still preserving property rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven time, money and human sensitivity,\u201d the book said, \u201cthe integrity of a magnificent piece of land such as the Hollister Ranch can remain intact.\u201d\n\nThe fees\n\nThe special sections carved into the Coastal Act have given Hollister Ranch unique standing \u2014 but even that legal language is now in dispute.\n\nThe sticking point was the recent realization that based on the way the law was written, the sections addressing Hollister Ranch can be read a few different ways. And for 30 some years, no one had seemed to challenge the property owners\u2019 interpretation of how the fees should be paid.\n\nBut based on the way state officials now say the law should be interpreted, the numbers don\u2019t add up.\n\nSanta Barbara County has issued 206 coastal development permits to Hollister Ranch since 1982, according to a Times records request. If the 1982 amendment to the Coastal Act did indeed require a $5,000 in-lieu fee per permit, that would amount to more than $1 million.\n\nTo date, officials have received only $295,000.\n\nWhen asked about the discrepancy, Dianne Black, the county\u2019s planning and development director, whose department is responsible for issuing the permits, said that the county had been collecting an in-lieu fee only as a one-time payment for the first coastal development permit issued on a vacant property at Hollister Ranch \u2014 not for every permit.\n\nThe Hollister Ranch Owners Assn., which represents the more than 1,000 people today who own a share of the ranch, also says the fee is a one-time payment per parcel, citing a clause that says the in-lieu fee is required for a permit seeking to develop \u201con any vacant lot\u201d on the ranch. So if an owner built a house on an empty parcel and paid $5,000, their lawyers said, that\u2019s the last fee they would have to pay.\n\nIf the fee was required for each and every permit, the lawyers said in a letter to state legislators, then \u201cif the owner wants to build a barn, he pays another $5,000. If he wants to put up a fence \u2026 that\u2019s another $5,000. An owner who puts up six different structures (barn, guest house, ag worker housing, etc) would pay $5,000 x 6 = $30,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be no limit to the number of times that an individual property owner would be subject to the fee. This is clearly not what the Legislature intended when enacting these provisions of the Coastal Act,\u201d an attorney for the owners group wrote in a recent letter to the Coastal Commission, calling on officials to continue the practice of requiring a fee per vacant lot. \u201cTo do otherwise would be acting beyond its Legislative mandate and likely an unconstitutional taking.\u201d\n\nThe 1982 access plan, they added, is obsolete and infeasible.\n\nThe Coastal Commission, now aware of this discrepancy, said it has updated the wording in local planning documents to clarify that the $5,000 fee is required for every project.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, it\u2019s going to be per permit, not per vacant lot. We made sure the county is clear on that,\u201d executive director Jack Ainsworth said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be monitoring all the permits coming in.\u201d\n\nwww.hollister-ranch.com\n\nThe push to open Hollister Ranch had gone quiet until this year, when coastal officials ceded a claim to a public path in a controversial deal that many considered favorable to landowners.\n\nFacing public outrage, the state started looking for ways to finish what it started decades ago.\n\nA number of coastal commissioners, not enamored with the deal they approved, have begun speaking out. Two commissioners recently appealed a Hollister Ranch permit that had been issued to build a new house, guest house and footbridge \u2014 citing for the first time in decades that a condition of any permit, under the Coastal Act, is providing public access in a timely manner.\n\nThe panel will vote this month whether to overrule this permit, marking perhaps another legal avenue for public access.\n\nRead more: Amid backlash, Coastal Commission asks state to 'explore all potential options' to open Hollister Ranch to the public \u00bb\n\nAt the same time, Gov. Brown rejected a separate attempt by lawmakers to open the ranch.\n\nThe legislation would have recommitted the state to the 1982 access plan and clarified the purpose of the in-lieu fees. It also laid the foundation for more aggressive strategies, such as acquiring private land for public use through eminent domain.\n\nBrown said the legislation was well-intentioned \u2014 but years too late.\n\n\u201cAlthough this program could have been completed over three decades ago,\u201d Brown wrote in his veto message this week, \u201cit was not and it is now outdated.\u201d\n\nSo he urged state officials to go back to the drawing board and craft a better plan.\n\nrosanna.xia@latimes.com\n\nInterested in coastal issues?

  "text": "(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe team of Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies cruises the 5 Freeway, stopping motorists on the Grapevine in search of cars carrying drugs.\n\nThey\u2019ve worked the mountain pass in Southern California since 2012 and boast a large haul: more than a ton of methamphetamine, 2 tons of marijuana, 600 pounds of cocaine, millions of dollars in suspected drug money and more than 1,000 arrests.\n\nBut behind those impressive numbers are some troubling ones.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the drivers pulled over by the Domestic Highway Enforcement Team were Latino, according to a Times analysis of Sheriff\u2019s Department data. And sheriff\u2019s deputies searched the vehicles of more than 3,500 drivers who turned out to have no drugs or other illegal items, the analysis found. The overwhelming majority of those were Latino.\n\nSeveral of the team\u2019s big drug busts have been dismissed in federal court as the credibility of some deputies came under fire and judges ruled that deputies violated the rights of motorists by conducting unconstitutional searches.\n\nThe Times analyzed data from every traffic stop recorded by the team from 2012 through the end of last year \u2014 more than 9,000 stops in all \u2014 and reviewed records from hundreds of court cases. Among its findings:\n\nLatino drivers accounted for 69% of the deputies\u2019 stops. Officers from the California Highway Patrol, mainly policing traffic violations on the same section of freeway, pulled over nearly 378,000 motorists during the same period; 40% of them were Latino.\n\nTwo-thirds of Latinos who were pulled over by the Sheriff\u2019s Department team had their vehicles searched, while cars belonging to all other drivers were searched less than half the time.\n\nThree-quarters of the team\u2019s searches came after deputies asked motorists for consent rather than having evidence of criminal behavior. Several legal scholars said such a high rate of requests for consent is concerning because people typically feel pressured to allow a search or are unaware they can refuse.\n\nThough Latinos were much more likely to be searched, deputies found drugs or other illegal items in their vehicles at a rate that was not significantly higher than that of black or white drivers.\n\nHow a team of L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputies stops Latino drivers at a disproportionate rate\n\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department said that racial profiling \u201cplays no role\u201d in the deputies\u2019 work and that they base their stops only on a person\u2019s driving and other impartial factors.\n\n\u201cThe [team] has removed tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of illegal narcotics from circulation, including heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl,\u201d the department said in a statement responding to The Times\u2019 analysis. \u201cA recent arrest involved the seizure of approximately 10,000 Oxycodone tablets, a small dent in the opioid addiction crisis that has enveloped our nation.\u201d\n\nA Sheriff\u2019s Department spokeswoman declined interview requests to discuss The Times\u2019 specific findings. The department would not say whether it has conducted its own analysis of the deputies\u2019 stops.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Department officials said the team was launched as a response to a spate of drug overdoses in the Santa Clarita area. Similar units operate around the country as part of a federal program designed to use local and federal law enforcement agencies to combat drug trafficking.\n\nIn December, Sheriff Jim McDonnell heaped praise on the team, ticking off its accomplishments in a lengthy statement. \u201cThe importance of this mission cannot be overstated,\u201d the sheriff said.\n\nBut several legal and law enforcement experts said the department\u2019s own records strongly suggest the deputies are violating the civil rights of Latinos by racially profiling, whether intentionally or not.\n\n\u201cWhen they say, \u2018We\u2019re getting all these drugs out of here,\u2019 they are not taking into account the cost,\u201d said David Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies racial profiling by police. \u201cThey are sacrificing their own legitimacy in the community as a whole and the Latino community in particular.\u201d\n\nKimberly Fuentes, research director for the California League of United Latin American Citizens, described The Times\u2019 findings as \u201cextremely disturbing and troubling\u201d and said the advocacy organization would demand a meeting with Sheriff\u2019s Department officials.\n\n\u201cThese findings risk tarnishing any trust between the Sheriff\u2019s Department and the Latino community,\u201d Fuentes said.\n\nOn Thursday, after The Times published its findings, McDonnell released a statement saying he was proud of the team\u2019s work but also \u201cconcerned about any allegation of racial and ethnic profiling.\u201d He said he takes \u201cvery seriously questions about race and police procedures\u201d and would work with the county\u2019s inspector general \u201cto examine any issues of concern.\u201d\n\n\u2018Looking for a defeated expression\u2019\n\nOn a recent morning, Deputy John Leitelt wound his way up the Grapevine.\n\nThe shift had been uneventful. Leitelt had stopped several vehicles, but he quickly cut the drivers loose after exchanging a few words and seeing nothing suspicious.\n\nHe had spent an extra few minutes with a Latina motorist he stopped for an expired registration. When Leitelt learned she was traveling to Fresno to visit a friend, he asked where she would be staying. When she said she hadn\u2019t yet made a reservation, he would say afterward, he was suspicious.\n\nHe asked whether he could squeeze a large stuffed toy dog sitting in the passenger seat. She agreed, and Leitelt then asked whether he could look in the trunk. Inside was a small suitcase, and Leitelt decided she was telling the truth. He thanked the woman and let her go.\n\nLater, Leitelt explained that he carefully studies a motorist\u2019s reaction when he asks for permission to search their car. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a defeated expression,\u201d he said.\n\nLeitelt, a deputy for 18 years, joined the highway team at its start. He and the team\u2019s three other deputies \u2014 all white men \u2014 typically work alone in marked SUVs. Their terrain spans the roughly 40 miles of freeway from the border with Kern County to just south of Santa Clarita.\n\nL.A. County Sheriff's Deputy John Leitelt patrols a stretch of the 5 Freeway near Castaic. Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cIf we search everyone just because as cops we think we have carte blanche and have authority over people, then we\u2019ve lost our way.\u201d L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy John Leitelt\n\nThough the deputies are looking for any criminal, nearly all of the arrests are for drug-related crimes. The 5 Freeway, they say, is a pipeline for cartels to move drugs up the West Coast and return to Mexico with cash from drug sales as well as weapons purchased in the U.S.\n\nAlthough The Times\u2019 review of department data shows that 74% of the drivers he pulls over are Latino, Leitelt said race or ethnicity does not influence whom he chooses to stop.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for people from Mexico \u2014 not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for people who are driving a certain way\u2026. If we search everyone just because as cops we think we have carte blanche and have authority over people, then we\u2019ve lost our way.\u201d\n\nHe later declined to comment on The Times\u2019 analysis of the team\u2019s stops.\n\nIn deciding whom to stop, Leitelt said, he looks for certain behavior, such as drivers traveling at or below the speed limit and then hitting the brakes when they see his cruiser. He also tirelessly \u201ckills plates\u201d \u2014 cop jargon for running license plate numbers through a state law enforcement database on his in-car computer. Cars with expired registrations, a man driving alone in a car registered to a woman, or an older car with a recent registration will get closer attention, he said.\n\nOnce he sees a car he believes is worth checking out, Leitelt needs a valid reason to make a stop. That can include any minor traffic violation, such as speeding or crossing a lane line without signaling.\n\nTo prolong a stop and continue questioning a driver, Leitelt and other law enforcement officers need reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed, a legal bar that the U.S. Supreme Court defined as something more than a hunch.\n\nThey can search a vehicle if the driver gives permission. Otherwise, an officer needs probable cause \u2014 where the facts and circumstances indicate a crime is being committed. The smell of an illegal drug, a weapon lying on a seat or a police dog outside the car signaling the scent of drugs inside can be enough.\n\nAs he was on his way back to the station at the end of his shift, Leitelt noticed an old Volkswagen Beetle struggling up a hill in the middle lane. The deputy drove up alongside the car and saw a young Latino-looking man behind the wheel.\n\nThe deputy dropped back and slid in behind the car. Tapping the California plate into his laptop, he saw the vehicle had new license plates and was recently registered to someone who lived several hours north. Leitelt noticed the windshield was cracked \u2014 a violation of the state\u2019s vehicle code and legal justification to stop the car.\n\nThe man, who said he spoke no English, explained in Spanish he was driving slowly because the car\u2019s engine was old and \u201cdidn\u2019t have any heart.\u201d He said he worked in California and was making his way to Mexico to visit his young daughters.\n\nLos Angeles County sheriff's deputies take a driver to wait in a patrol car so they can search his car.

Right: Deputies Michael Vann, left, and John Leitelt search the man's vehicle. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe man seemed fidgety and nervous to Leitelt. With traffic zooming by, the deputy instructed him to get out and walked him to the back of the Volkswagen. Leitelt asked in Spanish whether he was carrying methamphetamine. Heroin? Cocaine? Marijuana? A large amount of cash?\n\nThe man repeatedly said no, and his voice and expression remained unchanged \u2014 usually a sign, the deputy said later, that someone is being truthful. But Leitelt also thought the man was avoiding eye contact, which he interpreted as an indication of possible deception.\n\nLeitelt and another member of the highway team did a quick pat-down of the man\u2019s clothes for weapons and then put him in the back of a patrol SUV.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s super nervous,\u201d Leitelt said.\n\nLeitelt wondered aloud if the driver feared the deputies would ask him about his immigration status. Nonetheless, he pressed ahead, opening the car\u2019s hatch with the man\u2019s key and unzipping his suitcase. Inside were neatly folded clothes, including new dresses for young girls, and some greeting cards.\n\nThinking the suitcase could be \u201ca prop,\u201d Leitelt kept going. Using an assortment of prying tools, he and the other deputy popped off a section of the dashboard in search of a hidden compartment traffickers sometimes build.\n\nL.A.

Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nWhen a density meter dubbed \u201cthe Buster\u201d gave an irregular reading on the passenger-side door, Leitelt knocked, peered down into the window well and swung the door open and shut several times before deciding there were no drugs hidden inside. The stop lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nThe deputies walked back to the SUV and opened the door.\n\n\u201cOK, adios,\u201d the other deputy told the man, making a shooing gesture with his hand. Without saying a word, the man walked back to his car and drove off.\n\n\u2018Psychological babble\u2019\n\nAllegations of racial profiling by police are common, but researchers using data on traffic stops say it is difficult to show definitively that officers selectively target one race or ethnicity. In the case of the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s highway team, experts said using the population of L.A. County, which is 48% Latino, as a benchmark would be misleading. Ideally, they said, they would want to know the racial breakdown of all drivers on the particular section of the 5 Freeway.\n\nBut the fact that Latinos made up such a smaller percentage of stops by CHP officers along the same stretch strongly indicates that the Sheriff\u2019s Department team was targeting the group, said several racial profiling experts who reviewed The Times\u2019 findings.\n\n\u201cNo matter how justified the stops are, this is what we call selective enforcement,\u201d said Jeffrey Fagan, a Columbia Law School professor who was an expert witness for plaintiffs in a federal civil rights lawsuit against the New York Police Department over its now-defunct stop-and-frisk policy.\n\nOrange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties\u2019 sheriff\u2019s departments have similar highway enforcement teams. In response to public records requests, officials in Orange County said the Sheriff\u2019s Department does not collect racial data on traffic stops. The other two agencies refused to release data.\n\nThe federal Domestic Highway Enforcement program drew criticism in recent years over concerns that teams were using stops to improperly seize cash and other property from motorists. In California and elsewhere, defense attorneys have challenged stops, arguing that the highway teams overstep constitutional lines.\n\nIn 1999, drug searches by a group of CHP officers during traffic stops led to a lawsuit alleging racial profiling of Latino drivers. To settle the claims, the department banned all officers from asking drivers for consent to search vehicles for several years and retrained them on racial biases.\n\nDouglas Wright, executive director of the National Criminal Enforcement Assn., a nonprofit group that provides training to highway teams, described such units as an effective tool for finding drug traffickers. He said they also help deter unsafe driving whether or not they search vehicles and find anything illegal.\n\nHis organization, he said, teaches officers to avoid any profiling.\n\n\u201cAll races, all genders and all people are capable of committing these crimes \u2026 smuggling these drugs, guns, humans,\u201d he said.\n\nHave you been stopped by L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputies on the Grapevine?

The U.S. Supreme Court has sanctioned such searches, viewing consent as a straightforward green light from drivers or passengers to proceed unless there is evidence of coercion.\n\nThe Times reviewed data from nearly 4,500 searches conducted by the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s highway team and found that about 75% were based on consent from drivers or passengers.\n\nA Sheriff\u2019s Department spokeswoman said the agency was \u201cconfident that the DHE team appropriately uses consent searches as a recognized investigative tool, in compliance with all applicable legal standards.\u201d\n\nSome legal scholars have raised concerns about police routinely seeking permission to search.\n\nConsent searches \u201care based on this fiction that people who say yes \u2026 are gleefully saying, \u2018Yes, officer, I am happy to help,\u2019 and that anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be searched will simply say no,\u201d said Hofstra University law professor Alafair S. Burke. \u201cBut, in reality, the average person hears an officer\u2019s request as a command.\u201d\n\nIn Rhode Island and New Jersey, police are prohibited from asking for consent to search a car unless they have reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\nData for all types of searches by the L.A. County team show that deputies found contraband in 20% of vehicles driven by Latinos. For black drivers, contraband was found 18% of the time; for whites, 16%. Those differences were not significant, according to a regression analysis conducted by The Times.\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s highway team has run into trouble in federal court, but not because of racial profiling allegations. In nearly two dozen cases filed by U.S. prosecutors, no judge has ruled whether the team is selectively targeting Latinos. Instead, the deputies\u2019 tactics and credibility have come under fire, resulting in 11 cases being dismissed.\n\nIn one, attorneys for a man caught with 38 pounds of cocaine and 8 pounds of heroin argued that Deputy Adam Halloran illegally prolonged the stop to grill the driver about whether he was carrying drugs.\n\nDeputy John Leitelt pulls a piece of a dashboard panel modified to hide drugs in an impounded vehicle. Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert H. Whaley agreed and warned that the highway team\u2019s practice of frequently seeking consent to search vehicles \u201cimposes an enormous burden on the privacy interests of drivers. Most drivers would be anxious to move on and would fear that a denial of permission to search would indicate something to hide\u2026. Voluntariness of such consent, if given, does not justify the tactic.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, Whaley said the team\u2019s mission seemed certain to lead to more illegal arrests.\n\n\u201cA policy of the police to create a department to make traffic stops only to seek consent or probable cause [for a search] is troubling,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSeven more federal cases were dismissed amid questions over the credibility of one deputy, James Peterson. Defense attorneys questioned the cases against their clients by pointing out that Peterson had been disciplined in the past for misconduct that involved dishonesty and that a federal prosecutor had once raised doubts about Peterson after the deputy changed his account of an arrest.\n\nPeterson was reassigned from the highway team last year.\n\nDefense attorneys have also challenged claims that deputies can tell whether a motorist is concealing drugs by their responses to simple questions.\n\nIn an arrest report detailing the seizure of 48 pounds of methamphetamine from a car he stopped, Deputy Michael Vann said the driver handed over his license so quickly it \u201cseemed abnormal, as if he wanted to speed up the traffic stop \u2026 as if he were trying to distance himself from me.\u201d The man\u2019s rocking slightly back and forth in his seat, Vann wrote, was possibly \u201ca way for him to release built up nervous energy.\u201d\n\nHow we reported this story on the L.A. County Sheriff's Department highway enforcement team \u00bb\n\nWhen the driver, Mario Manjarrez, told Vann he had been visiting family in Los Angeles and pointed toward the city, the deputy saw the gesture as \u201can anchor point movement,\u201d which he said criminals use to distract officers. In this case, Vann concluded, Manjarrez had been struggling to recall a made-up story about visiting family and pointed toward the city in an attempt to seem more confident.\n\nWhen the motorist took a step away from the car, the deputy wrote, it was an unconscious attempt at \u201cdistancing himself\u201d from what was inside. And the fact that he switched from saying \u2018no\u2019 to silently shaking his head when asked if he had methamphetamine or cocaine was reason for Vann to suspect he was carrying the two drugs.\n\nManjarrez\u2019s lawyer questioned how handing a license over too quickly could be a telltale sign of deception. She noted that Vann claimed in other stops that it was suspicious when drivers were slow and clumsy in handing over their licenses.\n\nAnd she pointed out that although Vann maintained that Manjarrez\u2019s finger pointing was a sign of a forgotten cover story, the deputy also had said that in other stops he based his suspicions on people who recited their stories too smoothly.\n\n\u201cI have doubts about the magical psychological powers of Deputy Vann.\u201d U.S. District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez\n\nVann argued that each stop was unique and that he had based his suspicion of Manjarrez on all he said and did.\n\nU.S. District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez concluded that Vann\u2019s justifications could make any word or movement grounds for suspicion.\n\n\u201cI have doubts about the magical psychological powers of Deputy Vann,\u201d Gutierrez said at a hearing in November. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s psychological babble.\u201d\n\nProsecutors dismissed the case before the judge issued a ruling on whether Vann\u2019s search of the car was illegal, and Manjarrez went free.\n\nAnother man caught with 10 pounds of methamphetamine concealed in a tire was let go after a different judge ruled that Vann violated the man\u2019s constitutional rights when he kept him detained without a valid reason. In a third case, a judge upheld the legality of a drug seizure but found that Vann had violated the driver\u2019s Miranda rights.\n\nVann, Peterson and Halloran did not respond to a request for comment made through the Sheriff\u2019s Department. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nOnly a small proportion of the arrests made by the highway team result in federal prosecutions, which generally carry stiffer sentences than state charges. In state court, more than 450 people pulled over by the deputies have been convicted of drug transportation and other crimes, according to a Times analysis of court data. About the same number of people arrested were not charged with a crime.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Department officials who oversee the highway team said in interviews they were unaware that any of the deputies\u2019 arrests had fallen apart in federal court. Sgt. Daniel Peacock, the team\u2019s direct supervisor, said the department no longer sends the team\u2019s cases to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for review.\n\nTimes staff writers Ryan Menezes and Ruben Vives contributed to this report.\n\nAdditional credits: Graphics by Swetha Kannan.

  "text": "It happens so quickly that you are left wondering if it ever happened at all. During a frenzied onslaught of music dominated by a manic piano line, 11 massive puppets seemingly float onstage above the action in the Philip Glass opera, \u201cSatyagraha,\u201d a revival of which is running at Los Angeles Opera from Oct. 20 to Nov. 11.\n\nMade of yellowing newsprint and old wicker baskets, the towering apparitions grimace and grin, smirk and scowl, revealing razor-like rows of rotten teeth. They have bulbous noses, top hats and monocles. Their eyes squint and glare. They are the bankers, politicians and wall street brokers that nightmares are made of and they are propelled, half-ragged and aghast, into the spotlight by performers \u2014 some on stilts that resemble decaying wooden crutches.\n\nDuring a recent weekday rehearsal, the grotesque puppets remain just long enough to take your breath away, and then disappear back into the shadows.\n\nThe giant puppets in the Philip Glass opera are made from newsprint and wicker baskets.

Director Phelim McDermott\n\nThis trick is part of a mesmerizing production design by associate director Julian Crouch that acts as a living, breathing backdrop for an abstract, non-linear opera informed by a deep dedication to ensemble work as opposed to the glorification of any one star or individual.\n\n\u201cStrength doesn\u2019t come through ego or force,\u201d says director Phelim McDermott. \u201cIt comes through a shared intention of what\u2019s happening between people \u2014 of what people can do collectively.\u201d\n\nIn another display of stunning teamwork, members of the chorus sing the word \u201cha\u201d 1,992 times during one section of the opera. The word, intoned repetitively in a kind of hypnotic chant \u2014 \u201cha ha ha ha ha ha ha\u201d \u2014 is not supposed to symbolize laughter, but rather to stimulate the dream-like environment that allows the opera to morph into a meditation about the power of collective action to effect change on both micro and macro levels.\n\nIt\u2019s a mantra, an om, of sorts. The spiritual sound that, in the Hindu tradition, signifies a higher level of consciousness.\n\nThat sound is embodied in the person of Mohandas K. Gandhi (played by Sri Lankan tenor Sean Panikkar) during the 20 pivotal years he spent in South Africa developing his philosophy of nonviolent resistance to political oppression.\n\nTina Koch straps on stilts before donning one of the puppets in the opera \"Satyagraha,\" during a rehearsal at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cSatyagraha\u201d is an L.A. Opera company premiere and \u2014 in addition to \u201cEinstein on the Beach\u201d (2013) and \u201cAkhnaten\u201d (2016) \u2014 completes the company\u2019s staging of Glass\u2019 \u201cportrait trilogy\u201d of operas about powerful thinkers who changed the world. This version is a revival of a 2007 staging in the United Kingdom presented by the English National Opera and Improbable Theatre, co-produced by New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera, and directed by McDermott.\n\nMcDermott co-founded Improbable in 1996 with Crouch and others, and the idea of a cohesive, non-hierarchical ensemble is dear to his heart. It is also, he says, an extension of the word \u201cSatyagraha,\u201d which translates from Sanskrit as \u201ctruth force,\u201d and was coined by Gandhi to describe the ideology he used as a leading force in the Indian independence movement.\n\nThe opera is more of a fever dream than a biopic, and hovers around a profound moment in Gandhi\u2019s life when he was kicked out of a first-class carriage in South Africa for the color of his skin. He had to decide whether to go home, or stay and resist. The world knows his answer, and the opera seeks to crack open the spirit of that choice in order to convey it in an atmosphere thick with provocative sights and sounds.\n\nThe cast of the opera \"Satyagraha\" rehearses at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles. Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe cast and crew of the opera \"Satyagraha\" prepare for rehearsal at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel that presenting a piece like \u2018Satyagraha\u2019 is really what we\u2019re here for,\u201d says L.A. opera resident conductor, Grant Gershon,. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece by a living American composer who has a lot to say and who says it really beautifully. It\u2019s a piece that can speak to many different kinds of audiences, and it has such a strength of purpose to it.\u201d\n\nSince there is no driving narrative in any traditional sense, the task of conveying what it all means falls to the opera\u2019s nine soloists, 40 chorus members, four supernumeraries, 12 \u201cskills ensemble\u201d members and 46 orchestra musicians, who taken as a whole, weave the tapestry that becomes the experience of the show.\n\nThe skills ensemble are the silent performers who propel the puppets and constantly shift and change the landscape onstage by manipulating basic materials including paper, sticky tape, wicker and corrugated tin \u2014 building transitory images as they go. Paper that waves and rages like fire, a fish that turns into Ganesh, a procession of newspaper that whizzes across the stage like a conveyor belt. (18,900 sheets of newspaper, all told, are used in this production.)\n\nThere is no dialogue, just pieces of music of varied length with lyrics derived by Constance DeJong from the sacred Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never sung something with so much repetition, and musically it can be challenging because you have to have extreme focus, otherwise you\u2019ll get lost,\u201d says J\u2019Nai Bridges, a mezzo-soprano who plays Gandhi\u2019s wife Kasturbai. \u201cBut at the same time, you also have to let go. It\u2019s a strange balance.\u201d\n\nMezzo-soprano J'Nai Bridges plays Gandhi\u2019s wife Kasturbai. Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times\n\nPeter Relton, associate director of the production, says it doesn\u2019t matter that most audience members won\u2019t understand the words. Glass\u2019 intention, he says, was to create a distinct \u201csound world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the soloists are singing, and moving through this world, the skills ensemble creates the atmosphere and the environment they\u2019re in,\u201d he explains.\n\nRob Thirtle, skills ensemble lead, is one of a few members of the performance team to have been with the production since 2007. He jokes that he is \u201cmulti-talentless\u201d and that he ended up in the skills ensemble because he is \u201cnot very good in a lot of areas.\u201d But really, he is a skilled craftsman and an adept performer who knows how to move with purpose in silence, and understands the transformational power of improvisation onstage.\n\nThe idea of metamorphosis is specific to the design concept, Thirtle says, adding that Crouch says he considers puppetry to be a \u201cgutter art\u201d\u2014 a puddle in the road that isn\u2019t particularly pleasing to the eye, but is transformed into something beautiful as soon as the moon is reflected in it.\n\n\u201cIn this show, our hope was to transform found garbage \u2014 bits of materials blowing around on the street \u2014 and to turn those into beautiful images before the audience\u2019s eyes,\u201d he says. \u201cImages that appear for a moment and then disappear back into the wind.\u201d\n\nIn order to allow this kind of controlled, creative chaos to thrive onstage around her, Bridges says that she has learned to relinquish her ego entirely. A rare practice, indeed, in the world of opera.\n\n\u201cIt really feels like we\u2019re just one big unit,\u201d she says. \u201cNot one person is more important than the other.\u201d\n\nThat once again, says McDermott, is the definition of Satyagraha. It\u2019s a message he feels is more pressing than ever, and one he hopes the audience carries with them into the streets after the show.\n\nA scene from the Metropolitan Opera's 2011 production of \"Satyagraha,\" directed by Phelim McDermott.

  "text": "Curiosity is Susan Orlean\u2019s superpower.\n\nHundreds of L.A. firefighters fought the devastating fire.at downtown\u2019s Central Library on April 29, 1986. Thousands of people contributed to the Save the Books campaign afterward. Millions heard the news that the library was burning and then that it was caused by arson. But more than three decades later, only Orlean was asking who did it and why, and wonderingwhether anyone today should care. In a reverse \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d Orlean took a fire and turned it into a book.\n\nTitled \u2014 aptly and ingeniously \u2014 \u201cThe Library Book,\u201d it tells the story of the mysterious fire that burned 400,000 books while also tracing Orlean\u2019s love of libraries, from trips with her mother to taking her son. Along the way, she relates the unexpectedly colorful history and future of the L.A. Public Library.\n\n\u201cMy first interest was writing a book about the day-to-day life of a big city library. I could have done that anywhere,\u201d she said over lunch after we visited the library together. \u201cI liked the idea of doing it in L.A., out of this contrarian idea that people don't associate libraries with L.A., which made it kind of delectable.\u201d\n\nThat said, the 1986 fire (forgive me) was the spark.\n\nA longtime staff writer for the New Yorker, Orlean had begun living in Los Angeles part of the year (she and her husband also maintain a home in New York). While exploring the city\u2019s institutions, she visited the flagship of the L.A. Public Library and learned of its catastrophic fire. Although no people were seriously injured, the fire destroyed 400,000 books and damaged 700,000 more, causing $22 million in damages \u2014 more than $50 million today. It remains the largest library fire ever in America.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing story,\u201d she said. As we walked through the library, Orlean \u2014 petite, stylish and with electric auburn hair \u2014 was greeted by staffers she\u2019d gotten to know during her research.\n\nTapping a concrete wall, she explained where the fire had started, in the stacks. Built as two secure concrete chutes within the original 1926 building, the stacks held hundreds of thousands of books and were connected by a catwalk for librarians. After the fire started \u2014 leaping across the catwalk from the first stack to the second \u2014 the chutes served as dual furnaces, books trapped inside with the fire.\n\n\u201cTheir covers burst like popcorn. Pages flared and blackened and then sprang away from their bindings, a ream of sooty scraps soaring on the updraft. The fire flashed through fiction, consuming it as it traveled,\u201d Orlean writes in her book. \u201cIt reached for the cookbooks. The cookbooks burned up. The fire scrambled to the sixth tier and then to the seventh. Every book in its path bloomed with flame.\u201d\n\nIf you, like me, care about books, reading her brilliant, awful description of the conflagration feels like watching a snuff film.\n\nWreckage after the fire in L.A.'s Central Library. Larry Bessel / Los Angeles Times\n\nOrlean agrees. \u201cThere's something that we feel deeply about books that we don't feel about other objects \u2014 you know, it\u2019s an object!\u201d It was as if she were trying to convince herself. \u201cAnd nowadays, it's an object that can be replaced pretty easily. Even so. There is something about it that feels raw and vicious and aggressive.\u201d\n\nShe is a lifelong journalist, known for her careful, in-person research, showcased in her New Yorker pieces and books, including \u201cRin Tin Tin,\u201d a history of the Hollywood dog; \u201cThe Bullfighter Checks Her Makeup\u201d; and (despite Charlie Kaufman\u2019s fabrications in \u201cAdaptation\u201d) \u201cThe Orchid Thief.\u201d So I was surprised to hear what she said next. It was so mystical.\n\n\u201cI think we have some association with books that feels like there was a soul in there,\u201d Orlean said. \u201cThat there's a being in there, whether it's because writers have poured themselves onto the pages, whatever it is, I think there's something ineffable, mysterious about what makes books special, and I'm glad of that.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the underlying ideas of \u201cThe Library Book\u201d \u2014 that books, as both objects and ideas, are essential to the human project; that libraries are a vital destination that holds them safe.\n\nSo who would want to torch one?\n\nThat was a question L.A. authorities thought they had answered on Feb. 27, 1987, when they arrested 28-year-old Harry Peak on suspicion of arson. Peak was released three days later after the district attorney declined to file charges against him.\n\nIt is a fine mystery: Fire officials said there was an arsonist; Peak claimed, then disavowed, responsibility for the fire; no one else has ever been arrested in connection with the blaze. Whether Peak was the actual culprit is one of the central questions of Orlean\u2019s book.\n\nHarry Peak emerges into the glare of TV lights after being released from jail on Mar. 2, 1987. Jack Gaunt / Los Angeles Times\n\nOrlean describes Peak as \u201cthe consummate storyteller.\u201d Handsome and underemployed, he was a little bit rootless and quite a big talker; some news reports called him a part-time actor. He matched a sketch of the suspect. According to some (but not all) accounts, he was downtown at the time.\n\n\u201cThere were two big storytellers in the book,\u201d Orlean tells me. \u201cOne was Harry Peak and the other was Charles Lummis, who was an incredibly admirable and important figure in the history of LA.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an unexpected pairing. Lummis was the first city editor of the L.A. Times and founded the Southwest Museum; more pertinent to this story, he was also L.A.\u2019s city librarian, a tenure Orlean details in the book. His hand-built stone home, which is now a museum on the southern edge of Highland Park, was known for the rowdy parties \u2014 he called them \u201cnoises\u201d \u2014 he threw there. By any measure, Lummis was a significant figure in the history of Los Angeles, while Peak, apart from being the arson suspect, passed through barely leaving a mark. But, Orlean says, Lummis \u201cwas a bit of a fabulist, and he would tell stories that his friends didn't always believe.\u201d So did Peak.\n\n\u201cWe tell stories to ourselves, to each other,\u201d Orlean says, as though forgiving the fabricators. \u201cIt's the lifeblood of being human.\u201d\n\nSusan Orlean at L.A.'s Central Library. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nPerhaps she is sympathetic to the tale-spinners, because to be a writer in 2018 means to side with art. Right now, looking at this, you could Google \u201cHarry Peak\u201d or \u201clibrary fire\u201d and easily read the nuggets the internet spits out at you. Orlean\u2019s project is bigger. It has to be.\n\n\u201cI think that one of the great burdens of being a nonfiction writer is this feeling that anybody could go look this stuff up,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not delivering any information that no one else can access. I've gone on a trip to the pyramids and you're sitting around the dinner table and people say, \u2018How was your trip? What were the pyramids like?\u2019 Well, they could go look it up online, but that's not the point.\u201d\n\nPyramids in Egypt or a 32-year-old news story in Los Angeles, the point is elevating the narrative so it tells us something about ourselves or the world, making it something worth noticing. \u201cThe history of the library is fascinating, and reminding people that libraries are kind of cool and interesting is exciting,\u201d Orlean said. \u201cI got very charged up about it.\u201d\n\nFire Capt. Don Stukey examining the damage after the 1986 fire, which was determined to be arson. Boris Yaro / Los Angeles Times\n\nShe admits that editors are rarely convinced by her story ideas on the surface. \u201cThere is some kind of pleasure that I find in saying, \u2018I know you think that this couldn't possibly be interesting, but it really is. Give me a minute, I'll persuade you.\u2019 That awareness that I'm having to prove to people every sentence of the way that this is something worth their time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, this is super interesting. No, no, wait, wait, no. There's more,\u201d she demonstrated. \u201cAnd then there's more, and you're not going to believe. That's how it feels to me, that I'm tugging on somebody\u2019s sleeve saying, \u2018Wait, wait, one more second. Let me just tell you one more thing, you're not going to believe it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom where we sat at lunch, we could see the library building. I asked our server if she knew that it was the site of the biggest library fire in American history. She didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cOoh, I just got the chills,\u201d the server said. She turned to Orlean. \u201cAnd you wrote a book about it? What\u2019s it called? What caused the fire?\u201d\n\nFor generations of Angelenos, this will be the first they\u2019ve heard of the fire, the massive fight to contain it, the thousands of books frozen in an effort to preserve them, the water damage, the stop-start effort to restore and expand the library where its visionary architect put it at the corner of 5th and Flower in downtown Los Angeles, of the man who may have set it aflame, maybe even of libraries around the world destroyed by fire through the ages, taking untold stories with them.\n\nIt\u2019s all there. They just have to borrow \u201cThe Library Book.\u201d\n\nSusan Orlean inside the Los Angeles Central Library.

  "text": "Fear of earthquakes is part of life in California.\n\nBut people experience this anxiety in different ways. For some, the fear prompts them to take steps to protect themselves: strapping down heavy furniture, securing kitchen cabinets and retrofitting homes and apartments.\n\nFor others, the fear prompts denial \u2014 a willful ignorance of the dangers until the ground starts shaking.\n\nSeismologist Lucy Jones has spent her career trying to understand public attitudes about earthquakes, with a focus on moving people past paralysis and denial.\n\nJones said the way experts like her used to talk about earthquakes wasn\u2019t very effective. They tended to focus on the probability of a major earthquake striking in the next 30 years \u2014 the length of a typical home mortgage. They also took pains to say what they didn\u2019t know, which she now believes allowed the public to tune out and hope for the best.\n\nNow she is making a dramatically different point, emphasizing that a devastating earthquake will definitely happen, and that there is much the public can do to protect themselves.\n\nDenial may getting a bit harder these days. Over the last several years, a few California cities have taken dramatic steps to require retrofits of thousands of vulnerable buildings. And next year, scientists and the U.S. Geological Survey are expected to unveil the first limited public phase of an earthquake early warning system that would eventually offer seconds and perhaps more than a minute of warning through smartphones and computers. The system has been planned for years but still could be derailed by budget cuts proposed by President Trump.\n\nOK, now what? Here's how to plan your actions for before \u2014 and during \u2014 an earthquake \u00bb\n\nThree factors that make something especially frightful\n\nThere are several factors that make a peril especially frightening, Jones told a joint meeting of the Japan Geoscience Union and American Geophysical Union. She named three of the biggest ones, citing the work of University of Oregon psychologist Paul Slovic:\n\nSomething that cannot be seen.\n\nSomething that is very uncertain.\n\nSomething that seems unknowable.\n\n\u201cAll of these trigger our primal fears of the unseen predator hiding in the jungle,\u201d Jones said.\n\nResearchers inspect a fissure running through fields for five miles following an earthquake near Kobe, Japan, in 1995.. (Tokyo Shimbun/ Associated Press)\n\nHumans hate randomness\n\n\u201cWe have literally evolved to be afraid of randomness,\u201d Jones said at a recent conference in Japan.\n\n\u201cSo we respond \ufeffby trying to find the pattern. We evolved to find these patterns to infer that waves in the grass means a predator in hiding. We find patterns even when they\u2019re not real,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see constellations in the stars. When there is no pattern, we still try to make one.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem\n\nRather than accepting the randomness, the public has turned to scientists to take the uncertainty out of future earthquakes, and researchers have spent much effort trying to find an answer.\n\nThere was some optimism in the successful prediction of the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Haicheng, China, in 1975, in which people were evacuated before the quake struck, saving lives, Jones said.\n\nA large part of the answer? There were more than 500 \u201cforeshocks\u201d to the big temblor, most of them in the 24 hours before the largest quake hit.\n\n\u201cThe prediction did not happen because the Chinese knew more than we do about foreshocks,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey used the basic principle \u2026 quantified more than a century ago: One earthquake makes another earthquake more likely, and guessed that having a swarm of over 500 events made a big earthquake even more likely.\u201d\n\nOfficials in that region of China had more to gain by ordering evacuations because of the weakness of the buildings against earthquakes. And they had less to lose from a false alarm, given the political and economic system of China at the time, she said.\n\nSuccess in predicting a 1975 earthquake in China was shortlived. In 1976, scientists did not predict a magnitude 7.6 earthquake that killed a quarter-million people. Visitors stop at a memorial to the dead in 2016. (European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t repeatable\n\nBut the great guess of 1975 wasn\u2019t repeated when California scientists tried to do the same thing in the central part of the state.\n\nScientists in California were so convinced of a seemingly logical pattern of earthquakes in the Monterey County town of Parkfield that they projected a 95% chance of another magnitude 6 earthquake happening between 1988 and 1993.\n\nThe scientists were wrong. It would be until 2004 before the quake hit. The model, it turned out, wasn\u2019t always right.\n\nMurray and Kelly James look at their Christchurch, New Zealand, home, destroyed in an earthquake in 2011. (Mark Baker / Associated Press)\n\nTelling us the future probability of a quake wasn\u2019t making us safer\n\nAnd therein lies the great problem of being so obsessed with when the next big earthquake will come: It wasn\u2019t making us safer.\n\nPublicizing the odds of a devastating earthquake in the next 30 years just didn\u2019t translate well to the public.\n\nCities up and down California were doing little, if anything, about ordering vulnerable buildings to be strengthened or demolished before they collapsed in a future earthquake.\n\n\u201cPsychologists tell us that uncertain things are more frightening. Something that is frightening and uncertain is something we would like to ignore,\u201d Jones said.\n\nSo what could be done?\n\nA home in Fillmore, Calif., nearly six months after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. (Joe Pugliese / Los Angeles Times)\n\nChanging the question\n\nInstead of asking themselves, \u201cWhat does society want from us?\u201d scientists began considering a separate question: \u201cWhat does society need from us?\u201d\n\nSo, in the case of earthquakes, Jones shifted the answer.\n\nSeismologist Lucy Jones stands on the San Andreas fault on May 3. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nTalking about what scientists know \u2014 instead of what they don\u2019t\n\nJones said she learned to focus her talking on what she did know, rather than what she did not.\n\nFor one, she and a team of researchers published a scientifically plausible scenario of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the San Andreas fault that could cause many deaths and the collapse of numerous buildings.\n\nAlso, Jones said she learned to tell property owners they would have to pay for how their building fares in an earthquake \u2014 either as a retrofit or by picking up the pieces after the building collapses.\n\n\u201cBy emphasizing the financial aspects, I moved people away from fear that can paralyze decision-making,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI showed them that they were going to have to pay for the earthquake, one way or another. Either now or after it happens. It was just a matter of when.\u201d\n\nPlus, there was a community responsibility \u2014 the collapse of one building would affect their next-door neighbor, as well as the entire community. \u201cSomeone\u2019s decision not to be ready increases the chances that others will suffer,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAfter decades of doing little to nothing, political leaders and property owners agreed something had to be done. In 2015, Los Angeles passed the nation\u2019s most sweeping seismic retrofit law, which will require as many as 15,000 buildings at risk of damage in an earthquake to be strengthened.\n\nWooden apartments can collapse because of flimsy ground-story columns. Click on the link for an explainer of this flaw, and how it can be fixed. (Raoul Ra\u00f1oa / Los Angeles Times)\n\nA moral responsibility\n\nTragedy can happen when the public does not understand the risk as scientists do.\n\nJones recalled a previous trip to a devastated area of Japan washed away by a tsunami after the magnitude 9 earthquake off the nation\u2019s east coast in 2011. Communities there endured a death toll as high as 10% of the population, she said.\n\nShe remembered being taken to Otsuchi, where the city hall sat behind a 20-foot sea wall. Experts had forecast a 16-foot tsunami from the quake.\n\n\u201cThe city leaders ignored protocol that said to move to higher ground and conducted their emergency meeting in the city hall. When the tsunami poured over the sea wall, they lost over 1,000 people, including most of their city government,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThe woman who gave me the tour asked me to begin by entering this shrine constructed in front of the city hall and to pray for the victims, because, as she said, we need to remember why we are doing this,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cI want us to remember the victims. Remember that society wants our help \u2014 needs our help \u2014 to save people\u2019s lives and their livelihoods,\u201d she told her fellow scientists. \u201cI am saying that, as a scientific community, I believe we should \u2014 as a moral duty \u2014 be fostering the creation of information that can be used to make a safer society.\u201d\n\nGet ready for a major earthquake.

  "text": "Tahlia Hein moved to New York City on a tight budget and without a TV. When she and her roommates finally got one, chipping in for cable on top of a $50 utilities bill per roommate just wasn\u2019t feasible. So she opted instead to subscribe to TV streaming services like Netflix and Sling TV.\n\nCutting the cord, she said, \u201cwas very liberating.\u201d\n\nForgoing cable and satellite TV is a decision that\u2019s increasingly common \u2014 1 in 7 Americans is a cord cutter and an additional 9% have never had a cable or satellite TV subscription, according to Pew Research Center. In the first three months of the year, cable and satellite services lost about 762,000 subscribers, about five times as many the same period last year, according to research firm MoffettNathanson.\n\nWith the average monthly price of cable or satellite TV hovering around $100 in the U.S., cutting the cord can save consumers hundreds of dollars each year.\n\nThat is, until they start subscribing to streaming alternatives.\n\nCord cutting has been heralded as a consumer-friendly revolution that lets audiences pay only for the content they enjoy. But as the market becomes more crowded and competitive, it\u2019s uncertain whether digital-only services will necessarily prove less expensive than the cable and satellite services they\u2019re quickly supplanting.\n\nThat much is clear already to customers who rely on multiple streaming services, such as Hein, who wound up subscribing to Sling TV, Netflix, CBS All Access and Amazon Prime.\n\n\u201cSling is how I've been getting my cable jones for about a year now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was also a hefty subscription to hang on to.\u201d\n\nHer predicament isn\u2019t unique, according to Ian Olgeirson, an analyst with the Kagan division of S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen consumers complain about spending but at the same time have ramped up their spending,\u201d he said.\n\nWith more than 130 streaming services (also referred to as over-the-top services), a hodgepodge of sticks and boxes such as the Roku streaming stick and Google \u2019s Chromecast for viewing on television sets, and cloud DVRs, there\u2019s no shortage of products tailored to a la carte viewing.\n\nVideo-on-demand staples such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have thousands of movies and television shows available at any time, as well as original shows. At just a few dollars a month, they helped drive many to digital alternatives and continue to attract both cord cutters and pay-TV subscribers alike.\n\nStreaming services Monthly base fee Original content Special features Live TV Streaming Services Amazon Prime Video Monthly Base Fee $8.99 Original content Yes Special Features Free two-day shipping on Amazon purchases with $10.99 monthly plan Live TV Streaming Services Hulu Monthly Base Fee $7.99 Original content Yes Special Features None Live TV Streaming Services Netflix Monthly Base Fee $7.99 Original content Yes Special Features DVD by mail with additional monthly fee Live TV Streaming Services YouTube Red Monthly Base Fee $9.99 Original content Yes Special Features Ad-free YouTube content; Google Play Music\n\nSource: LATimes, Makeda Easter\n\nHigher-cost offerings such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, DirecTV Now and the recently announced Hulu With Live TV are growing in popularity.

The streaming service features original scripted programs.\n\n------------------------\n\nUntil recently, live sports programming was nearly impossible to watch without a cable-TV subscription. But now sports fans can get their fix through add-on packages via Sling TV, for $45 a month, and fuboTV, which starts at $14.99 a month.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous niche services like Crunchyroll, an anime streaming service, for $6.95 a month; Acorn TV, dedicated to British content, for $4.99 a month; and Curiosity Stream, a documentary platform, for $2.99 a month.\n\nIndividually, these services are far less expensive than cable-TV packages. But for viewers whose favorite programs aren\u2019t covered by a single streaming provider, the costs can quickly mount.\n\n\"You're going to see consumers who look at those packages and realize a smaller package is going to ultimately not hitting all buttons they want to hit,\" Olgeirson said. \"We\u2019re entering a phase of more choice but not one in which consumers have ultimate leverage.\"\n\nUltimate leverage would allow customers to pay for just the programs they like: say NFL Football, \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d local news programming and Nickelodeon. But for now, that could require purchasing an antenna and subscriptions to DirecTV Now, Netflix and PlayStation Vue.\n\nThat\u2019s because of what telecommunications analyst Craig Moffett calls the value chain. Studios make shows, which are bundled to networks, which are bundled to media conglomerates, which are bundled into a broad package from a cable or satellite provider.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk about unbundling ... they mean unbundling individual networks from each other,\u201d Moffett said. \u201cCustomers find it frustrating that selecting individual networks is not one of their options.\u201d\n\nAnd on top of subscription costs, there\u2019s that pesky Internet bill.\n\nAccording to analyst Bruce Leichtman at Leichtman Research Group, in 2016 the average cost for pay-TV service nationwide, including plans bundled to broadband and sold on their own, was $103 per month. And according to Kagan, the price of Internet access only, without pay TV, was $52.29 per month in the first quarter of 2017.\n\nSo hypothetically, if a cord cutter pays the average rate for an Internet-only package and subscribes to Hulu\u2019s live-TV service ($39.99 per month) and YouTube Red ($9.99 per month), they\u2019ll pay $102.27 \u2014 saving 73 cents per month compared with the average pay-TV bundle. Throw in Amazon Prime Video ($8.99 per month) or any streaming sports service and cord cutting becomes the costlier alternative.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to find a streaming mix that matches or exceeds the average costs of cable. And streaming prices could rise in the future.\n\nAlthough broadband rates don\u2019t appear to be rising substantially as a whole, there\u2019s a chance that cord cutting could someday lead providers to increase monthly Internet bills to mitigate the loss of cable customers, according to a MoffettNathanson report.\n\nWith a strong correlation between the amount of video consumed and the Internet speed that consumers think they need, providers could possibly upsell customers on costlier broadband packages. They could also increase price of unbundled Internet or simply raise prices for everyone.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s efforts to walk back net neutrality rules \u2014 potentially allowing Internet service providers to offer priority treatment to certain websites and services \u2014 could also make streaming products more expensive.\n\n\u201cWithout these rules, cable companies will be free to degrade the video quality of any streaming service they disfavor,\u201d said Joshua Stager, a policy counsel at the New America Foundation\u2019s Open Technology Institute.\n\nThat could push customers into costlier services.\n\nBroadband providers, Stager said, \u201ccould also force streaming services to pay onerous access fees \u2014 fees that would almost certainly be passed on to consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk to all streaming services,\u201d Sling TV Chief Executive Roger Lynch said.\n\nAlso a risk: price hikes due to the scarcity of the very content that makes streaming services so popular in the first place.\n\nNetflix, Hulu and Amazon have helped usher in another golden era in television thanks to their ambitious shows such as \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d They\u2019ve sparked a demand for high-quality and imaginative storytelling that studios are eager to fill.\n\nThese shows, however, aren\u2019t cheap or easy to make. Despite studios\u2019 efforts to ramp up production, there\u2019s a chance that demand for such programming from streaming services and TV channels will outstrip the supply from studios \u2014 potentially raising costs.\n\nThough competition between streaming services could rein in some price hikes, if costs go up across the industry, expect the viewers to be the ones who foot the bill.\n\nQuestions of cost aside, the cord-cutting trend is only likely to accelerate. Emarketer estimates that cord cutters and cord nevers (people who have never subscribed to pay TV) will grow from 51 million in 2017 to more than 66 million by 2020.\n\nDon\u2019t count Hein among that number. After seeing her combined Internet and streaming bills climb to about $112, the 31-year-old, who works in digital media, made a call to a cable company, which offered an Internet and cable bundle that was $20 more per month than what she was paying as a cord cutter. The cost was greater, but so was the convenience: No longer would she have to futz with different apps to find her favorite shows.\n\nOn Friday, she began the transition back to cable.\n\nThat said, she\u2019s not ruling out subscribing to streaming services. Hein said she\u2019d happily shell out for a channel dedicated exclusively to the \u201cLaw & Order\u201d franchise.\n\n\u201cI can't believe we aren't there yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI would pay real money to subscribe to that.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writer James F.

  "text": "Catherine Nadeau was never a supporter of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, but as a resident of historically conservative Orange County she had never bothered to get involved in local politics either.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s surprise presidential win changed that.\n\n\u201cThis has been a wake-up call for me that it\u2019s very important, that you need to vote locally,\u201d Nadeau, 48, said as she and two dozen district residents waved signs about climate change outside Rohrabacher\u2019s office on a recent sunny Tuesday. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about getting Trump out right now, but I can do something in the next 567 days to get this guy out.\u201d\n\nNadeau is among the newly energized residents giving Democrats hope they can claim at least some of the congressional seats in Orange County that have been red for a generation. Despite the vocal optimism from activists and local dissatisfaction with Trump, it will be an uphill battle for Democrats to flip the four heavily Republican congressional districts in Orange County, all but one of which the incumbent won in 2016 by double digits.\n\nMore than a dozen resistance groups have formed in Orange County since the presidential election. They\u2019ve demanded meetings with the four Republican members of Congress, and staged town halls in their name when the members decline. They\u2019ve delivered petitions and Valentines and even protested outside the members\u2019 homes. Most Tuesdays, at least a few dozen people show up with signs outside district offices (some of which they\u2019ve been told they can no longer enter).\n\nThey\u2019re bolstered by the fact that last fall marked the first time Orange County chose a Democrat for president since 1936, a gradual decline in voters registering as Republicans and growing numbers of Latino and Asian voters.\n\nGround zero\n\nSo, 17 months before the 2018 election, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making Irvine ground zero for its efforts in western states, with a full-time staff member brought in to help with races.\n\nThe four targeted Republicans are Reps. Ed Royce of Fullerton, Mimi Walters of Irvine, Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach and Darrell Issa of Vista. They have been among the most lambasted after Republicans voted to roll back the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough the minority party historically wins seats in midterm elections, the national Democratic Party faces a tough path to flip the 25 districts it needs to reclaim majority control of the House in 2018.\n\nFewer and fewer congressional districts are considered competitive, so districts where the political parties think they have a chance \u2014 such as places where voters picked a member of Congress from one party and a president from another \u2014 can expect to see a lot of action in the coming months. (Radio and online attack ads are already running in Orange County.)\n\nSeven of the 23 congressional districts that sent a Republican to the House and also picked Hillary Clinton for president are in California.\n\n\u201cThey need to cast a wide net for opportunities, and as soon as Donald Trump lost Orange County that set off some sirens at the DCCC,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan political analysis site Inside Elections.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean voters there are suddenly Democrats\n\nPerhaps Republicans just didn\u2019t like Trump, Gonzales said. That doesn't make them liberals.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know that we can throw away a couple of generations of history, of election results, after one race,\u201d he said.\n\nExcept for president, Republicans won the majority of other races in Orange County, all the way down the ticket. The state\u2019s voters rejected a ballot measure to require voter approval of revenue bonds, but the county voted 57.1% in favor. A vote signaling opposition to the Citizens United decision allowing money to flood into politics passed statewide but garnered just 46.6% in Orange County.\n\nRepublicans still lead voter registration here, though they make up less than 45% of registered voters in any of the targeted congressional districts.\n\nDemocrats have managed to narrow the registration gap over the last four years from 10 percentage points to 3.7 points, and they'll have to continue to chip away if they want to win seats. Almost a third of voters are registered as having no party preference, and Democrats are hoping to leverage independent voters to win. As one activist pointed out, the majority of voters in Orange County don\u2019t back the Republican Party, and might be willing to go in a new direction.\n\nThe normal political rules don\u2019t seem to apply right now\n\nOrange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Fran Sdao said she has never experienced anything like this enthusiasm. The number of local Democratic clubs has nearly doubled since the election, and her phone rings off the hook with people asking what they can do to help.\n\n\u201cI don't think any of us could have predicted this surge in interest,\" she said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in uncharted territory.\"\n\nThat\u2019s already attracted four Democrats challenging Rohrabacher, three in Walters\u2019 district, two for Issa and one for Royce. Sdao said about a dozen more people have expressed interest in running.\n\nWhich candidate has the best chance to grab a Republican seat? Narrowing the field may be the most delicate part of Democrats\u2019 balancing act. The national Democratic Party has a history in California of backing candidates who can raise a lot of money but don\u2019t always have strong local ties.\n\nThe first hints of that habit are popping up in Walters\u2019 45th District, where the national party appears more excited about UC Irvine associate law professor Dave Min over UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter, who has been active with the local resistance groups. Both Democrats have started making appearances at the protests outside of Walters\u2019 office.\n\nAfter this story was published, a spokesman for the DCCC said the party supports all the Democrats in the race. And at the local level, Sdao said Democrats aren\u2019t picking favorites just yet. \u201cThey just need to go out there and talk to people,\u201d Sdao said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to hope they weed themselves out a little bit.\u201d\n\nPicking battles\n\nDemocratic strategist Mike Trujillo said Democrats have a better chance of flipping seats in the Central Valley, where they\u2019ve trained operatives and built a political infrastructure over years of challenging the region\u2019s Republicans. In 2016, voters reelected Reps. David Valadao (R-Hanford) and Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) but also backed Clinton for president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you have that same cohort of field organizers that have been trained in Mimi Walters\u2019 district, or Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s district,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cWhen you have the infrastructure in place like we do in the Central Valley it just gives you the edge and it makes the chances of flipping those districts even better.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have to set their sights on more seats than they expect to win, and that probably includes some of the long-shot Orange County seats, he said.\n\n\u201cYou sort of have to over-target if we really want to flip the House. You can\u2019t just go after the 25 seats that we need,\u201d he said.\n\nConstituents from California's 48th Congressional District protest in Huntington Beach in an effort to get Rep. Dana Rohrabacher to hold a town hall meeting. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)\n\nA heavy lift\n\nFlipping seats held by the other party for generations with 17 months of investment isn\u2019t a light lift, said California Republican strategist Jason Cabel Roe.\n\nIn his Irvine law office, Orange County Republican Party Chairman Fred Whitaker seemed pleased by the idea of Democrats aiming to win local races.\n\n\u201cLet them spend their money,\u201d Whitaker said with a laugh. \u201cIf they are spending all their money here where we\u2019re going to win, then that allows us to win in other places where Democrats might have a chance across the nation.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Rohrabacher won reelection in 2016 by 16.6%, Royce by 14.4% and Walters by 17.2%. Even in the closest race, where Issa eked out a win over a novice opponent with 0.6%, or 1,621 votes, the congressman performed strongly in the Orange County section of the district.\n\nWhitaker also dismissed the activists as the same group of people moving from district office to district office.\n\n\u201cOrange County doesn\u2019t respond real well to mass protests,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cIt does nothing but help us.\u201d\n\nCalifornia 45th organizer Amy Stevens smiled at Whitaker\u2019s take.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK. I would love for them to continue to think that way, because that will mean that they won\u2019t fight hard enough and it gives us an even better chance,\u201d the 43-year-old from Mission Viejo said.\n\nStevens joined two dozen people to march from Walters\u2019 Irvine office to a nearby intersection to wave signs. At protests throughout the county, people told the same story: They didn\u2019t realize how many of their neighbors were frustrated with Republicans until after the election and the women\u2019s marches that took many by surprise the day after the inauguration.\n\nStevens, a lifelong Democrat, said she respected Walters\u2019 experience as a local volunteer and even voted for the Republican in her first race.\n\n\u201cWe were all really complacent before this election, thinking that we lived in safety and things weren\u2019t that bad in Orange County,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cPeople who lived here just sort of assumed it was red and the Democratic Party assumed it was red too. I don\u2019t think there was very much effort made to make any change.\u201d\n\nsarah.wire@latimes.com\n\nFollow @sarahdwire on Twitter\n\nRead more about the 55 members of California's delegation at latimes.com/politics\n\nALSO:\n\nCalifornia's Republicans all voted yes on the healthcare bill.

DeMille, giant of the motion-picture industry, marked his 77th birthday yesterday with a party for 100 old and new friends.\n\nThe city of Los Angeles marked it by proclaiming it Cecil B. DeMille Day. ...\n\nParamount studio's luncheon room was well appointed as to decorations. But 45 years of memories swept the room and no one paid much attention to the flowers or the food.\n\nAll eyes were on the head table, with tangent glances at other tables. Famous stars of yesterday joined stars of today in singing \"Happy Birthday\" to the renowned filmmaker.\n\nSamuel Goldwyn, DeMille's partner 45 years ago when the made \"The Squaw Man\" in a Hollywood barn, was there. The late Jesse Lasky was another partner in this movie that made history.\n\nWhen DeMille, spare and erect, came into the room, Mary Pickford (\"America's Sweetheart\") embraced her old friend.\n\nThere were few dry eyes at that point.\n\nAmong members of the honoree's family were a daughter, Mrs. Joseph Harper; a granddaughter, Mrs. Cecilia Boughdadly, and two sons-in-law, Harper and Anthony Quinn.\n\nThrough DeMille's 77 years have been marked by monumental accomplishments, the emphasis for the septuagenarian is on the present and the future.\n\nY. Frank Freeman, head of the studio and a vice president of Paramount, presented a handsome album of 70 stills from 70 DeMille pictures.\n\nThe book has 20 blank pages for 20 more pictures.\n\nMany people talked. Some with wit, some with nostalgia.\n\nAmong them, Bob Hope, Danny Kaye, Mary Pickford, Joel McCrea and Sam Goldwyn.\n\nBut when DeMille rose, there was instant silence. He said many things \u2013 all of them pertinent. But the guests will remember that he said:\n\n\"This day puts me on a mountaintop 77 years high in which the view of the world is much clearer than it was 45 years ago. I have lived to see the movies become a world theater. In my way, I have helped.\" \u2026\n\nSix months later, on Jan. 21, 1959, DeMille passed away.\n\nThis post was originally published on Sept. 19, 2014.\n\nSee more from the Los Angeles Times archives here",

  "text": "Teachers at Garfield High School were winding down classes for the approaching lunch break when they heard the startling sound of people \u2014 they were not sure who \u2014 running through the halls, pounding on classroom doors. \u201cWalkout!\u201d they were shouting. \u201cWalkout!\u201d\n\nThey looked on in disbelief as hundreds of students streamed out of classrooms and assembled before the school entrance, their clenched fists held high. \u201cViva la revoluci\u00f3n!\u201d they called out. \u201cEducation, not eradication!\u201d Soon, sheriff\u2019s deputies were rumbling in.\n\nIt was just past noon on a sunny Tuesday, March 5, 1968 \u2014 the day a Mexican American revolution began. Soon came walkouts at two more Eastside high schools, Roosevelt and Lincoln, in protest of run-down campuses, lack of college prep courses, and teachers who were poorly trained, indifferent or racist.\n\nBy the time the \u201cblowouts\u201d peaked about a week later, 22,000 students had stormed out of class, delivered impassioned speeches and clashed with police. Scenes of rebellion filled newspapers and television screens. School trustees held emergency meetings to try to quell the crisis; Mayor Sam Yorty suggested students had fallen under the influence of \u201ccommunist agitators.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of the disruptions, Julian Nava, the only Mexican American on the Los Angeles Board of Education, turned to Superintendent of Schools Jack Crowther. \u201cJack,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is B.C. and AD. The schools will not be the same hereafter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Crowther. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThe East L.A. walkouts 50 years ago were the uniquely California embodiment of the fury and hope that marked much of 1968. The first act of mass militancy by Mexican Americans in modern California history set the tone for activism across the Southwest as America drifted into a year of social turmoil, assassinations, war and disillusionment.\n\nRELATED | 1968: A timeline of anger, grief and change \u00bb\n\nThe walkouts focused national attention on a new force on the American political scene, the Chicano movement. Once a pejorative term, \u201cChicano\u201d was adopted by a new generation of urbanized Mexican Americans as an emblem of ethnic pride, cultural awareness and a commitment to community.\n\n\u201cWe caught the entire nation by surprise,\u201d said David Sanchez, founder of the militant Brown Berets, which had its seeds in the movement for educational reform and then took on farmworker rights, police brutality and the issue that managed to mobilize just about everyone who was protesting in 1968: the Vietnam War. \u201cBefore the walkouts, no one cared that substandard schools made it all but impossible for Chicano youths to find strength and pride in their culture, language and history \u2014 or to make the most of their lives,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\n\u201cAfter the walkouts,\u201d he added, \u201cno one could deny that we were ready to go to prison if necessary for what we believed, which was this: With better education, the Chicano community could control its own destiny.\u201d\n\nPete Martinez, a former teacher at Lincoln, said students that year ignited a movement that would transform generations of Latinos in America. \u201cIn 1968, the kids kicked the doors open,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Sanchez, founder of the Brown Berets, in 1968 and today.

(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times; Raul Ruiz)\n\nWith better education, the Chicano community could control its own destiny.\u201d David Sanchez, Brown Berets founder\n\nIn 1968, Mexican American students living east of downtown were funneled into high schools with some of the worst dropout rates in the nation \u2014 57% at Garfield, 45% at Roosevelt, 39% at Lincoln.\n\nEastside schools were run-down and overcrowded, and the community had little political power. The Mexican American community was young \u2014 about half the population was under 20 \u2014 and there were no Mexican Americans on the City Council or Board of Supervisors.\n\nAt Eastside schools, Spanish speakers felt trapped in slower tracks that funneled them toward low-skilled jobs.\n\nHarry Gamboa, now a celebrated photographer and performance artist, remembered the day in elementary school when the teacher led him to the front of the class and helped him fashion a hat made of construction paper as an art project. \u201cShe put it on my head and wrote the word \u2018Spanish\u2019 on it. She said I could take it off when I learned to speak English,\u201d he said. Years later, he would join the walkouts at Garfield.\n\nAlthough the walkouts seemed spontaneous, they grew out of years of social activism. Since 1963, Camp Hess Kramer, a Jewish summer camp in Malibu, had hosted motivational programs for outstanding East L.A. students, who shared grievances about their underperforming high schools and neglected neighborhoods.\n\nRELATED | Do you remember the East L.A. walkouts? Share your memories \u00bb\n\nOthers stopped in at the Social Action Training Center, an effort run out the Church of the Epiphany in Lincoln Heights by John Luce, an Episcopal priest who supported labor leader Cesar Chavez.\n\nFour young activists opened the La Piranya Coffee Shop in 1967 at the corner of Olympic and Goodrich boulevards as headquarters for their organization, Chicano Youths for Community Action. They were led by Sanchez, then a clean-cut 18, who was president of Yorty\u2019s youth advisory commission, and Vickie Castro, a Cal State Los Angeles student who, years later, would become the second Latino ever elected to the Los Angeles Board of Education.\n\nWe were all products of Camp Kramer and Church of the Epiphany and, therefore, aspired to remake society.\u201d Vickie Castro (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cWe were all products of Camp Kramer and Church of the Epiphany and, therefore, aspired to remake society,\u201d Castro recalled. \u201cAt La Piranya, we organized strategies for doing just that, and shared outrage over things like a Time magazine article that described East L.A. as \u2018reeking of garbage and wine.\u2019\u201d\n\nLa Piranya\u2019s walls were covered with murals depicting scenes from Mexico\u2019s past, and a startling declaration in large black letters: \u201cPor mi raza mato,\u201d or \u201cFor my race I kill.\u201d\n\nRevolution was in the air. Black militant Stokely Carmichael swung by La Piranya. So did two figures known for their edgy and angry brand of activism \u2014 Rodolfo \u201cCorky\u201d Gonzales of Colorado and Reies Tijerina of New Mexico.\n\nOne day in 1967, hours before a protest against police harassment, Sanchez ran by the garment district to buy a dozen berets \u2014 the headgear seen on countless posters of Latin American revolutionary Che Guevara. Back at La Piranya, he dealt them out like playing cards, saying, \u201cPut these on, we\u2019re going to a demonstration.\u201d\n\nThe Chicano Youths for Community Action had became the Brown Berets.\n\nThe group operated under a manual written by Sanchez that included a passage members were required to memorize:\n\n\u201cFor over 20 years, the Mexican American has suffered at the hands of the Anglo establishment. He is discriminated against in schooling, housing, in employment and in every other phase of life. Because of this situation, the Mexican American has become the lowest achiever of any minority group in the entire Southwest.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Brown Berets listen to a speaker during the East L.A. walkouts on June 9, 1968.

Los Angeles Times\n\nWhat people were only beginning to realize was that \u2014 much as the students at a Florida high school this year have seized the debate over gun control from the adults \u2014 it was the high school students of East L.A. who would refuse to wait for the adults to act.\n\nSal Castro, then a social studies teacher at Lincoln and a charismatic guest speaker at La Piranya, said his students \u201cwanted things changed at the school. They wanted to hold what they called a \u2018blowout\u2019 \u2014 a walkout.\u201d\n\nHis response: \u201cOrganize. What do you need?\u201d\n\nThe original plan was to present a series of demands \u2014 and the threat of a walkout \u2014 to the school board in 1967. The plot fizzled.\n\nBut the next year, on Friday, March 1, the principal at Wilson High in El Sereno abruptly canceled the school play, \u201cBarefoot in the Park,\u201d a romantic comedy deemed risque. Hundreds of students walked off campus in anger.\n\nThe organizers of the failed walkout plot saw their chance. Sal Castro, Brown Berets, college students and others, including students recruited from high schools, holed up at La Piranya and other hangouts over the weekend to prepare.\n\nBy Tuesday, March 5, they were ready to launch. Joseph Rodriguez, then a sophomore at Garfield High, recalled sitting in basic biology class when \u201csomeone banged on our wooden door yelling, \u2018Walkout! Walkout!\u2019 We heard commotion outside. Many of us, including the teacher, ran to the window to see what was going on.\n\n\u201cMy teacher looked me in the eyes,\u201d Rodriguez recalled, \u201cand said, \u2018I can see you\u2019re really interested in this stuff. You\u2019re free to go.\u2019\u201d\n\nRodriguez saw students hemorrhaging through the gates and onto surrounding sidewalks and streets. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in riot gear arrived and over bullhorns ordered them back to class. Most refused.\n\nJoseph Rodriguez was a Garfield High sophomore during the 1968 walkouts. He watched as students filed out of class and amassed in nearby streets, where some were beaten by police. Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times\n\nA Coca-Cola delivery truck happened to drive up, and students began grabbing bottles and hurling them at deputies. Wading into the fray were the Brown Berets, who had planned to offer students protection. Sanchez later boasted that he outran two deputies \u201cchasing after me with batons waving.\u201d\n\nThe next day, it was Vickie Castro\u2019s mission to occupy the Lincoln principal while cohorts fanned out across campus and encouraged students to leave school. She pretended to be an applicant for a teacher\u2019s assistant position and peppered the principal with questions.\n\n\u201cI held the principal hostage for 20 minutes while one worried staffer after another rushed into his office to whisper the worsening news in his ear,\u201d she recalled with a chuckle. \u201cFinally, he said, \u2018Sorry, but I really have to go.\u2019 Then I drove to Roosevelt High for more action.\u201d\n\nWhen Vickie Castro pulled up at her alma mater, an administrator recognized her. \u201cVickie, if you come on campus I\u2019ll have you arrested,\u201d she said. \u201cTurn around. Now.\u201d\n\nShe drove off \u2014 for the other side of the campus, and joined other activists inciting students to walk. A brief clash with police resulted in several arrests. Students walked out at Belmont the next day. Protest plans there had spread not just by word of mouth, but by messages written in marker on the grout between tiles: \u201cWalkout. Today. 12:30.\u201d\n\nPolice handcuff two women, a Brown Beret and a Free Press photographer, in front of Belmont High School on March 8.

But these early walkouts were about education. Students carried American flags and signs reading, \u201cWe demand schools that teach,\u201d \u201cSchool not prison\u201d and \u201cWe are not \u2018dirty Mexicans.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring one day of protest, a heavy rain broke out. At Lincoln, a few of the demonstrators who braved the downpour noticed that the water streaming down Sal Castro\u2019s face was mixed with tears of pride.\n\nThe unrest continued for about a week, with protests erupting at a few other campuses \u2014 even two junior highs \u2014 not originally included in the walkout plans. At a raucous school board meeting 10 days into the protests, students presented 36 demands. Some seemed excessive: Only pass/fail grades. Student lounges with jukeboxes. Mexican dishes in the cafeteria prepared by local mothers.\n\nOthers were very basic: Smaller classes. New libraries. More bilingual counselors, teachers and principals. Improved testing to distinguish between a lack of English proficiency and lack of intelligence. More lessons on Mexican American culture, art and history. And no corporal punishment.\n\nWilson High School student Peter Rodriguez waves his intact draft card at a school board meeting on March 12 to rebut authorities' claims that the protests were inspired by communism. Raul Ruiz\n\nThe school board agreed outright to two of the demands \u2014 more bilingual personnel and smaller classes. Generally, however, the district said it was already doing what the students asked, or wanted to comply but lacked funds.\n\nIn the walkouts\u2019 aftermath, the organizers basked in support from high-profile leaders, including Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, who made time to congratulate some students on the tarmac at Santa Monica Airport while in California to meet Cesar Chavez.\n\nSome educators supported the students, but quietly. \u201cWe were secretly guided behind the scenes by sympathetic teachers and administrators who used us, in a way, as their own vehicles for change,\u201d Vickie Castro recalled. \u201cThey even helped me write speeches I gave after the blowouts during meetings with school officials.\u201d\n\nWe were secretly guided behind the scenes by sympathetic teachers and administrators who used us, in a way, as their own vehicles for change.\u201d Vickie Castro Sal Castro talks to students at Lincoln High in 1968. Los Angeles Times\n\nBut the walkouts also unleashed ugly emotions. As an example of the attitudes Mexican American students faced, community leaders cited an essay Richard C. Davis, a wood shop instructor at Lincoln, published that spring in the school\u2019s faculty publication.\n\nDeclaring that \u201cmost of the Mexican Americans have never had it so good,\u201d he wrote: \u201cBefore the Spanish came, he was an Indian grubbing in the soil and after the Spanish came, he was a slave. It seems to me that America must be a very desirable place, witness the number of \u2018wetbacks\u2019 and migrants both legal and illegal from Mexico\u2026.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWhen it comes to going to school \u2014 free and the best in the world \u2014 he (the Mexican-American) is passive. Absenteeism is his culture, his way of life \u2014 always manana maybe he will get an education \u2014 manana, when it comes to repairing his home, controlling childbirth, planning for tomorrow, he is passive.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement responded with undercover operations, raids and arrests. In June, authorities rounded up 13 activists, who were indicted by a grand jury on charges including conspiracy in having planned the walkouts. Each faced 66 years in prison.\n\nAmong those indicted were Sanchez and Sal Castro, who was the only teacher to publicly participate and back students\u2019 complaints to news media and school district officials.\n\nHe lost his job but was eventually reinstated after months of protests by Eastside parents. Castro had employment, but was bounced around to different campuses and made a substitute before finally landing at Belmont as a teacher. The indictments against the \u201cEastside 13\u201d were struck down by an appeals court in 1970.\n\nA year after the walkouts, UCLA\u2019s enrollment of Mexican Americans soared from 100 to 1,900. Over the decades, college enrollment increased from 2% to 25% nationwide. Chicano studies programs were founded at colleges and universities across the nation. More Mexican Americans also entered the ranks of vice principals and principals in the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\nBut perhaps the walkouts\u2019 greatest accomplishment was fostering in the Mexican American community a sense of possibility \u2014 the realization that a just cause sometimes requires speaking up.\n\n\u201cUntil that day, it never crossed my mind that Garfield High was run-down, overcrowded and lagging behind public schools in wealthier white neighborhoods,\u201d said Rodriguez, who later became a prize-winning columnist at the San Jose Mercury News. \u201cAll that changed after the blowouts.\u201d\n\nUntil that day, it never crossed my mind that Garfield High was ... lagging behind public schools in wealthier white neighborhoods. All that changed after the blowouts.\u201d Joseph Rodriguez\n\nMexican American parents who had never attended a school board meeting watched their children addressing the board. Rodriguez recalled that his father was initially appalled by the protests, then decided the students were right.\n\nVickie Castro recounted a dinner table confrontation with her own father. \u201cMy dad stared down at me,\u201d she said, \u201cand announced, \u2018Mija, I never thought you\u2019d grow up to be a communist.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no communist, Dad!\u201d she responded. \u201cThere\u2019s something terribly wrong with our schools. Our future is at stake.\u201d\n\nShe went on to become a teacher, principal and a Los Angeles school board member. But her role in the walkouts caused a rift in her family. One cousin, a sheriff\u2019s deputy, refused to speak to her for years.\n\nAs a middle school principal in East L.A. many years later, her radical past collided head on with the establishment world of education when three students walked out of class because they couldn\u2019t access their grades during a teacher\u2019s work stoppage. She suspended them.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be the other side of a walkout situation,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut that situation wasn\u2019t at all the same.\u201d\n\nVickie Castro, one of the leaders of the 1968 walkouts, is now a middle school principal in East L.A. Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times\n\nLater, she was approached by a group of Eastside high school students, many of them flanked by their parents, who were fed up because the campus cafeteria was serving too many burritos, and not enough variety.\n\n\u201cI had to turn around and stifle a chuckle,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, I fought hard for those burritos!\u201d\n\nThis year LAUSD is remembering the walkouts with seminars, instructional materials and an arts festival. The Plaza de Cultura y Artes in downtown will host a major exhibition on the walkouts\u2019 legacy. Many screenings are planned of \u201cWalkout,\u201d a movie about those fiery days produced by Moctesuma Esparza, who was one of the Eastside 13.\n\nThe dropout rates at Eastside high schools have improved dramatically since 1968 \u2014 Garfield, 13%; Roosevelt, 28%; and Lincoln, 21%. But they remain far higher than those at affluent Westside campuses, such as Malibu High, where it hovers at about 5%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d Vickie Castro said, \u201cbut there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nSome of that work is being carried out at a campus just west of downtown. It used to be Belmont Middle School. In 2010 it got a new name: Salvador B. Castro Middle School.\n\nSi desea leer esta nota en espa\u00f1ol, haga clic aqui\n\nSupport our journalism Already a subscriber? Thank you for your support.

  "text": "The year was fading. It was the morning of Christmas Eve, 1968, and the three-member crew of Apollo 8 was on its fourth orbit of the moon \u2014 the fourth such orbit in human history. Following their flight plan, the astronauts were executing a 180-degree roll, slowly turning the capsule as it shot through space.\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d\n\nAstronaut Bill Anders had been peering out a side window, holding up a bulky Hasselblad camera to take photographs of the moon\u2019s cratered surface. Looking up at the lunar horizon, he glimpsed something that no one had seen before: an Earthrise.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the Earth comin\u2019 up,\u201d he said, a trace of wonder in his voice. \u201cWow, is it pretty!\u201d\n\nDown there, on that gorgeous blue orb, it had been a hell of a year. The Vietnam War was raging, and Americans were fighting one another in the streets of their own cities. Half the world was engulfed in protest; angry students nearly shut down France and were slaughtered in Mexico. The Cultural Revolution swept like a fury across China; the Soviet Union crushed the Prague Spring. Assassins claimed the lives of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy; a beleaguered President Lyndon Johnson declined to run for reelection. Now Richard Nixon was weeks away from inauguration.\n\nIt all looked so peaceful, from the moon.\n\nAnders snapped a black and white photo, then hollered to Jim Lovell. \u201cYou got a color film, Jim? Hand me a roll of color, quick, would you?\u2026 Hurry!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the Earth comin\u2019 up. Wow, is it pretty!\u201d Astronaut Bill Anders\n\nThe photograph that Anders took became one of the most celebrated ever. It showed the Earth in all its living glory. It invited people to step away from one of the most contentious years anyone could remember and gain some perspective. Many talked about how it seemed to show the beauty and fragility of their one and only world, spinning through a dark and indifferent universe. The picture was credited with helping to launch the environmental movement.\n\nBut maybe it was Anders\u2019 next words that said the most \u2014 about hoping to capture a perfect image for his camera on the next orbit. \u201cIt\u2019ll come up again \u2014 I think,\u201d he told Lovell. He thought.\n\nBecause in 1968, who knew?\n\nA lot has changed in 50 years. The internet and cellphones have transformed the way we communicate. Our politics have become coarser and more polarized. Progress, however halting, has been made in race relations, in upholding the rights of women and people of different gender identities. Climate change has fundamentally altered the planet.\n\nRELATED | 1968: A timeline of anger, grief and change \u00bb\n\nYet the parallels between now and then are hard to ignore. In 1968, the United States was a deeply divided nation, whose president was viewed by many as crass and unbefitting his office. The United States was mired in a long war that many saw as pointless. White supremacists, rallying behind the presidential campaign of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, appeared newly emboldened. Gun violence and rampant drug abuse had given rise to worries about the fundamental health of American society. Women, people of color and gays and lesbians were demanding equality and respect.\n\nAnd each day seemed to bring a new shock.\n\nA soldier is wounded during the Tet Offensive in January 1968. Demonstrators clash with police in Paris in May 1968.\n\nRussian tanks roll through downtown Prague in August 1968. Guards man a student protest in Mexico City in October 1968.\n\nThe news cycle may have been slower then, but the news was not. Here are just a few of the events of that tumultuous year:\n\nIn January, North Korean patrol boats seized a U.S. Navy spy ship, the Pueblo, and its crew of 83, raising the prospect of war with the reclusive Communist state. Later that month, North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive, a massive assault on U.S.-held bases and cities throughout South Vietnam that deeply shook the confidence of the American public over a war their leaders had told them they were winning.\n\nIn February, Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams took a picture of South Vietnamese Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner on a Saigon street \u2014 a horrifying image that fed concerns that the United States was propping up a corrupt regime.\n\nSouth Vietnamese Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan fires his pistol into the head of suspected Viet Cong officer Nguyen Van Lem on a Saigon street, early in the Tet Offensive. Eddie Adams / Associated Press\n\nIn March, Sen. Eugene McCarthy came within 230 votes of defeating Johnson in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. Four days later, Sen. Robert Kennedy, younger brother of the slain president, announced that he too would challenge the incumbent. At the end of the month, a weary Johnson delivered a long, nationally televised address, ostensibly about the Vietnam War.\n\nRELATED | East L.A., 1968: The day a school walkout helped ignite the Chicano power movement \u00bb\n\nJournalists talk about \u201cburying the lead\u201d \u2014 placing the most important news far down in an article. No one has ever buried the lead like Johnson, who concluded his speech with words that millions of Americans can recite to this day: \u201cAccordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\u201d\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson declined to run for reelection. Associated Press\n\nIt was just four days later, on April 4, that King was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn. He was 39 years old. Kennedy got the word while campaigning in Indianapolis, and delivered the news to a shocked crowd \u2014 five decades later, it is still horrifying to hear their screams. His short, spontaneous speech would go down as one of the most eloquent in American politics.\n\nIt concluded: \u201cLet us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.\u201d\n\nLet us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.\u201d Robert F.

Within hours, riots erupted in 110 American cities, entire swaths of which were burned to the ground. The whole country seemed to be on fire. Had the American experiment failed?\n\nOn June 4, Kennedy won the California Democratic primary, making him the odds-on favorite to become his party\u2019s presidential nominee. A few minutes after midnight, he was shot to death at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nTo millions of Americans, the back-to-back assassinations felt like the end of hope.\n\nPresidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy lies on the floor at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after he was shot in the head. He had just finished his victory speech upon winning the California primary. Boris Yaro / Los Angeles Times\n\nIn August, at a heavily secured convention in Miami Beach, Republicans nominated Richard Nixon as their presidential candidate. Later that month, the Democrats convened in Chicago, where the streets quickly turned into a battle zone. \u201cThe whole world is watching!\u201d antiwar demonstrators chanted as cops used their nightsticks to beat them brutally and cameras captured the mayhem for an international audience. The Democrats nominated Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey as their standard-bearer.\n\nIn October, the Summer Olympics were held in Mexico City, where, days earlier, police and soldiers had turned their guns on student protesters, killing or wounding hundreds. The Games would be remembered for this scene: African American athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith raising black-gloved fists from a medal podium as the national anthem played. It was a moment of singular power, reflecting both black pride and black anger.\n\nExtending gloved hands skyward in racial protest, U.S. athletes Tommie Smith, center, and John Carlos stare downward during the playing of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" during the Summer Olympics in Mexico City.

In a victory speech, he pledged \u201can open administration\u201d that would seek \u201cto bridge the generation gap [and] the gap between the races. We want to bring America together.\"\n\nOn Dec. 21, Apollo 8 began its journey toward the moon.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, hours after the Earthrise photo was snapped, the three astronauts went on live television. Broadcast internationally, their appearance had an estimated audience of 1 billion people \u2014 at that point, the largest audience for any event in history.\n\nAnders said the astronauts had a message for the world. He paused, and began to read from a King James Bible:\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, and God said, \u2018Let there be light.\u2019 And there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness.\u201d\n\nHe handed the Bible to Lovell, who read the next section of Genesis.\n\nMission Cmdr. Frank Borman concluded the cosmic broadcast. \u201cAnd from the crew of Apollo 8,\u201d he said, \u201cwe close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you \u2014 all of you on the good Earth.\u201d",

  "text": "Two dozen ravens circled above Hugo Mountain\u2019s gray crags, swooping, pairing and paralleling one another in a whirl of courtship. As autumn arrives in the northwest corner of Alaska\u2019s Arctic, the land is folding in on itself in a riot of activity, color, cold air and sunshine \u2014 the natural world\u2019s last shout before the arrival of dark and ice.\n\n\u201cI like the fall up here,\u201d said Jay Denton, an educator raised in North Carolina who\u2019s spent the last decade in the small towns and villages of the region. Now he lives in Kotzebue, the town of some 3,200 residents about 20 river miles from Hugo\u2019s bald dome.\n\nDenton stared down at the broad cursive of the Noatak River as it trickled from the western edge of the Brooks Range toward the Chukchi Sea, flanked by taxi-yellow willows and spiky green spruce and miles of rolling tundra.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nFall in the Arctic is something to behold. It begins with a rush of chilled air that prompts the vegetation to change, a shift in the light, and a flurry of movement, both human and animal. It is a season of paradoxes as the flora and fauna come alive on the cusp of winter. But there\u2019s also the inevitable feeling of decay, of an ephemeral landscape slipping away.\n\nThis part of the country rarely makes headlines, even in Alaska. It was front and center for a day or two in 2015 during a visit from Barack Obama, the first-ever trip by a sitting U.S. president to the American Arctic. A celebration was held in the school gym. More recently, the tragic case of a missing 10-year-old girl found dead after a frantic weeklong search elicited gestures of support from around the state, with residents donning purple, Ashley Johnson-Barr\u2019s favorite color.\n\nDenton gestured toward the yellow and green vegetation, which won\u2019t stay that way long. \u201cThat\u2019ll go straight to brown right there,\u201d he said. There might be a brief interlude of red on the way.\n\nAnd that autumnal sense of decline is accompanied by a sensation of gratitude and optimism prompted by morning frost and the return of a dark night sky after months of inescapable sunlight.\n\nRising prominently along this stretch of the river is Hugo Mountain, a semi-popular hiking destination for Kotzebue residents and their guests, graffitied with the names of visitors written in fist- and head-sized stones gathered from the scree: Ted, Dana, Haiden, Carl, Amanda.\n\nThe journey upriver to Hugo in early September is a minor Arctic safari. Angular sandhill cranes perch like tan, circumspect flamingos in reed patches. Round, black seal heads pop out of the water, take an observant breath, then disappear, diving back below with a shimmering flourish. Disintegrating salmon carcasses rot among the riverbed\u2019s roots. The occasional falcon circles around the thin clouds.\n\nA view from Hugo Mountain looking out across the Noatak River. Zachariah Hughes / For The Times\n\nHidden in the vegetation and distance is the source of coveted red meat \u2014 caribou and moose.\n\n\u201cThis time of year it\u2019s really satisfying to gather your own sustenance,\u201d said 34-year-old Hans Hansen. Born and raised in Kotzebue, Hansen practices a hybrid lifestyle melding traditional subsistence hunting with the demands of a professional life in town as a physical therapist, husband and father. It means his fall weekends are spent looking for nourishing flesh to put away for the winter.\n\n\u201cIf I could, I\u2019d take the whole month of September off,\u201d Hansen said. He grew up hunting, taking his first caribou at 12, his first moose in 9th grade. The season is optimal for meat harvesting. The summer-plumped moose are moving. The caribou herds begin migrating south. Hansen loves the fall, not purely for the pragmatism of the season, but the sensation it enlivens.\n\n\u201cThe hunting gets you to establish a stronger connection being out in the nature,\u201d he said.\n\nSummer in the Arctic is intense. The sun never sets, hovering omnipresent with a glaring light that rarely relents. Bugs swarm incessantly. As the melting winter snow turns into mud, a kind of stasis sets in.\n\n\u201cSummer up here is boring,\u201d as Hansen put it.\n\nBut in August the land starts cooling off. The angle of the sun begins to sharpen. Colors saturate the long sunsets. The promise of restful dark nights and the mystery of stars return. Wild berries spring forth on the tundra like tiny jewels.\n\n\u201cBerry picking is part of life,\u201d said Faith Jurs, principal of the school in Noorvik, a small community of fewer than 700 people 43 miles upriver from Kotzebue.\n\n\"Berry picking is part of life\" in Arctic Alaska, a resident says. Zachariah Hughes / For The Times\n\nThe infinite tapestry of the tundra assumes more detail as clusters of ruby-red cranberries plump up. Low-bush blueberries dangle from scrubby vegetation like soft-skinned sapphires.\n\n\u201cBerry picking\u201d means something different here than in the Lower 48, where you might pay by the pound to roam the orderly rows of a tame orchard. Here it\u2019s free and wild. Folks spend hours scouring the ground, often conscripting their kids to help fill buckets with gallons of berries.\n\nMuch of it will be frozen for winter. In a part of the world where store-bought food is expensive and people still wrest enormous shares of protein from the land, sea and air, berries are one of the few locally available fruit options, a rare burst of sweet flavor in the dark tedium of deep February.\n\nAccording to Jurs, if you miss the weeks-long window to spend hours berry plucking, in Noorvik, folks will call out over the town\u2019s VHF radio \u2014 a sort of community-wide intercom still popular in rural bush communities \u2014 with offers to sell a gallon for $45. \u201cI think that\u2019s a bargain.\u201d\n\nEven though it was 9 p.m., Jurs was sitting in a lawn chair wearing sunglasses, enjoying the steep orange rays of sunlight, even as the chill air necessitated a jacket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect amount of light,\u201d she said of the season.\n\nJurs was in Kotzebue visiting her honey, Joe Groves, who in between sips of his drink would tend to cooking on the porch. Through the evening small plates suddenly materialized with samples of piping hot meatloaf, or freshly caught trout cooked so tender it dissolved at first taste like a meringue.\n\n\u201cSoon those greens won\u2019t be there, the caribou won\u2019t be there, and the moose won\u2019t be fat,\u201d Groves said of the fleeting fall.\n\nA view of Kotz Harbor in Kotzebue, a town of around 3,200. Zachariah Hughes / For The Times\n\nHistorically, fall was a difficult time, Groves said, because it used to be brief and intense. Climate change is altering that rhythm. The Arctic is warming much faster than southern environments, and fall is a prime example: The season is elongating.\n\n\u201cIt starts earlier and lasts longer,\u201d Jurs said. When she first came to the region 22 years ago, it snowed without fail before her birthday on Sept. 13. \u201cNow it may or may not.\u201d\n\nYears ago, there was no chance of launching a boat in the river during October because the ice would have started forming. \u201cNow you\u2019re almost guaranteed two weeks in October,\u201d Groves said.\n\nThe flip side is a later freeze-up along the rivers and tundra, delaying travel by \u201csnow machine,\u201d as Alaskans call snowmobiles, later and later. The variability is an undeniable threat for the region: unpredictable ice conditions, coastal erosion, changing animal patterns, infrastructure havoc \u2014 and unforeseen variables yet to pour out of a Pandora\u2019s climatological box.\n\nBut for inhabitants it is not a uniform blight.\n\n\u201cThis season is wonderful,\u201d Jurs said. \u201cIt used to be like two weeks long, and now it might be six weeks long. Which is bad for the world and great for us.\u201d\n\nEven for fans, the pleasure is unsettling.\n\n\u201cI know global warming is terrible,\u201d Jurs said, \u201cbut it\u2019s kind of nice.\u201d\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

  "text": "Of all the places to discover a lost city, this pleasing little community seems an unlikely candidate.\n\nThere are no vine-covered temples or impenetrable jungles here \u2014 just an old-fashioned downtown, a drug store that serves up root beer floats and rambling houses along shady brick lanes.\n\nYet there\u2019s always been something \u2014 something just below the surface.\n\nLocals have long scoured fields and river banks for arrowheads and bits of pottery, amassing huge collections. Then there were those murky tales of a sprawling city on the Great Plains and a chief who drank from a goblet of gold.\n\nA few years ago, Donald Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeology professor at Wichita State University , began piecing things together. And what he\u2019s found has spurred a rethinking of traditional views on the early settlement of the Midwest, while potentially filling a major gap in American history.\n\nUsing freshly translated documents written by the Spanish conquistadors more than 400 years ago and an array of high-tech equipment, Blakeslee located what he believes to be the lost city of Etzanoa, home to perhaps 20,000 people between 1450 and 1700.\n\nThey lived in thatched, beehive-shaped houses that ran for at least five miles along the bluffs and banks of the Walnut and Arkansas rivers. Blakeslee says the site is the second-largest ancient settlement in the country after Cahokia in Illinois.\n\nOn a recent morning, Blakeslee supervised a group of Wichita State students excavating a series of rectangular pits in a local field.\n\nJeremiah Perkins, 21, brushed dirt from a half-buried black pot.\n\nOthers sifted soil over screened boxes, revealing arrowheads, pottery and stone scrapers used to thin buffalo hides.\n\nBlakeslee, 75, became intrigued by Etzanoa after scholars at UC Berkeley retranslated in 2013 the often muddled Spanish accounts of their forays into what is now Kansas. The new versions were more cogent, precise and vivid.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, their eyewitness descriptions are so clear it\u2019s like you were there.\u2019 I wanted to see if the archaeology fit their descriptions,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single detail matched this place.\u201d\n\nKacie Larsen of Wichita State University shakes dirt through a screened box to see what artifacts may emerge. David Kelly / For The Times\n\nConquistadors are often associated with Mexico, but a thirst for gold drove them into the Midwest as well.\n\nFrancisco Vazquez de Coronado came to central Kansas in 1541 chasing stories of a fabulously wealthy nobleman who napped beneath trees festooned with tinkling gold bells. He found no gold, but he did find Native Americans in a collection of settlements he dubbed Quivira.\n\nIn 1601, Juan de O\u00f1ate led about 70 conquistadors from the Spanish colony of New Mexico into south-central Kansas in search of Quivira in the hopes of finding gold, winning converts for the Catholic Church and extracting tribute for the crown.\n\nAccording to Spanish records, they ran into a tribe called the Escanxaques, who told of a large city nearby where a Spaniard was allegedly imprisoned. The locals called it Etzanoa.\n\nAs the Spaniards drew near, they spied numerous grass houses along the bluffs. A delegation of Etzanoans bearing round corn cakes met them on the river bank. They were described as a sturdy people with gentle dispositions and stripes tattooed from their eyes to their ears. It was a friendly encounter until the conquistadors decided to take hostages. That prompted the entire city to flee.\n\nO\u00f1ate\u2019s men wandered the empty settlement for two or three days, counting 2,000 houses that held eight to 10 people each. Gardens of pumpkins, corn and sunflowers lay between the homes.\n\nThe Spaniards could see more houses in the distance, but they feared an Etzanoan attack and turned back.\n\nThat\u2019s when they were ambushed by 1,500 Escanxaques. The conquistadors battled them with guns and cannons before finally withdrawing back to New Mexico, never to return.\n\nThis bluff overlooks the spot where many believe Spanish conquistador Juan de O\u00f1ate met a delegation of Etzanoans. David Kelly / For The Times\n\nFrench explorers arrived a century later but found nothing. Disease likely wiped out Etzanoa, leaving it to recede into legend.\n\nBlakeslee enlisted the help of the National Park Service, which used a magnetometer to detect variations in the earth\u2019s magnetic field and find features around town that looked like homes, storage pits and places where fires were started.\n\nThen, relying on descriptions from the conquistadors, he discovered what he believes was the battle site in an upscale neighborhood of Arkansas City.\n\nVolunteers using metal detectors found three half-inch iron balls under the field. Blakeslee said they were 17th century Spanish cartridge shot fired from a cannon. A Spanish horseshoe nail was also found.\n\nIt all lent credibility to the detailed accounts left by the conquistadors.\n\nThe battlefield sits in Warren \u201cHap\u201d McLeod\u2019s backyard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great story,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lost city right under our noses.\u201d\n\nMcLeod, 71, offered a quick tour of the area.\n\nHe started at Camp Quaker Haven overlooking the spot where O\u00f1ate would have encountered the Etzanoans. McLeod then drove up to the country club, the highest point in the city of roughly 12,500 people.\n\n\u201cLots of artifacts have been taken from here,\u201d McLeod said.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nIn 1994, thousands of relics were unearthed during road construction. In 1959, the renowned archaeologist Waldo Wedel wrote in his classic book, \u201cAn Introduction to Kansas Archeology,\u201d that the valley floor and bluffs here \u201cwere littered with sherds, flints, and other detritus\u201d that went on for miles.\n\n\u201cNow we know why,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cThere were 20,000 people living here for over 200 years.\u201d\n\nLocal rancher Jason Smith, 47, said he had seen collections \u201cthat would blow your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruckloads of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWorked stone tools, flints. One guy had 100 boxes at his house.\u201d\n\nRussell Bishop, 66, worked at the country club as a kid.\n\n\u201cMy boss had an entire basement full of pottery and all kinds of artifacts,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe\u2019d be out there working and he would recognize a black spot on the ground as an ancient campfire site.\u201d\n\nBishop, who now lives outside Denver, has coffee cans full of arrowheads. He spread some on his counter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knew how big this all was,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re finally getting to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nKansas State Archaeologist Robert Hoard said that based on the Spanish accounts and the evidence of a large settlement, it\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d that Blakeslee has found Etzanoa.\n\nStill, he would like more evidence.\n\nThe early Great Plains had long been imagined as a vast empty space populated by nomadic tribes following buffalo herds. But if Blakeslee is right, at least some of the tribes were urban. They built large towns, raised crops, made fine pottery, processed bison on a massive scale and led a settled existence. There were trade connections all the way to the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan in Mexico.\n\n\"So this was not some remote place. The people traded and lived in huge communities,\" Blakeslee said. \"Everything we thought we knew turns out to be wrong. I think this needs a place in every schoolbook.\"\n\nAnd that may just be the beginning. Blakeslee has found archaeological evidence in Rice and McPherson counties for other large settlements extending for miles, which he believes existed around the same time as Etzanoa.\n\nHe has published his findings in the peer-reviewed journal Plains Anthropologist, and next spring he will present his evidence for Etzanoa at the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. A bigger excavation is planned for next summer.\n\nThe Wichita Nation, based three hours south in Anadarko, Okla., is watching all of this carefully. Experts believe the Etzanoans were their ancestors.\n\n\u201cThe accounts of O\u00f1ate and Coronado have been interpreted for years,\u201d said Gary McAdams, cultural program planner and historic preservation officer for the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, which number about 3,300. \u201cWe had a suspicion it was settled like this, but now it\u2019s starting to be documented, which makes it feel more real.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Arkansas City is trying to determine how to promote its new claim to fame. Etzanoa remains mostly underground or on private land. Yet that hasn\u2019t deterred interest.\n\n\u201cWe get about 10 calls a day to see the lost city,\u201d said Pamela Crain, director of the Convention & Visitors Bureau. \u201cThe vision is to have a visitors center. The other key is to persuade landowners to allow people onto their property.\u201d\n\nProfessor Donald Blakeslee of Wichita State University shows a black pot unearthed by student Jeremiah Perkins, behind him. David Kelly / For The Times\n\nRussell Bishop still has the arrowheads he collected as a kid in Arkansas City. David Kelly / For The Times\n\nLimited tours began last spring, focusing on key historical and archaeological sites. Town leaders are hoping for a UNESCO World Heritage site designation.\n\nBack at the dig site, all eyes were on Jeremiah Perkins as he lifted the hefty black potsherd from the dirt.\n\nBlakeslee dropped into the pit for a closer look. It was the largest artifact of the summer, perhaps 12 inches high.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice big cooking pot,\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nYet many mysteries remain about the people of Etzanoa.\n\n\u201cHow were they organized? How did they farm the bluffs? How did they maximize bison herds?\u201d Blakeslee asked. \u201cThe questions go on and on and on.\u201d\n\nAnd the thought of that made him smile.\n\nKelly is a special correspondent.\n\nALSO\n\nBeads, booze and babies?

  "text": "In the weeks after her deportation, Mayra Machado sat alone in a dark room, staring at her phone.\n\nIn video chats, her three children battered her with questions. Where was she? Why had she abandoned them? When would she come home to Arkansas?\n\nShe couldn\u2019t bear to tell them the truth \u2014 that she was in a remote village in El Salvador overrun with gangs \u2014 so she lied. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d\n\nThe United States deports hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year. But for Machado and other parents of American-born children, staying in their home country sometimes simply isn\u2019t an option, despite the risk.\n\nTo keep her promise to her kids, Machado had to embark on a dangerous journey abetted by abusive smugglers linked to a powerful drug cartel.\n\nShe would eventually make her way back to the sleepy town of Siloam Springs, Ark., but a reckless decision from her youth \u2014 and a little-known feature of American immigration policy \u2014 would threaten to separate her family yet again.\n\nMachado was 5 when she and her mother crossed illegally to the United States, fleeing bombings in their village during the final years of El Salvador\u2019s civil war.\n\nShe grew up speaking English with a laid-back California accent during her youth in Santa Ana. Later, after she and her mother moved to be near family in Arkansas, she adopted a gentle Southern drawl. She loved shopping and football and moved through life with a cheerful American optimism.\n\nAt age 19, Machado made a foolish mistake. After she fell behind on loan payments, her car was impounded. To get it out, she forged a friend's signature on two checks totaling $1,500.\n\nShe was found guilty of three felonies and, after completing a court-ordered boot camp program, vowed to never mess up like that again.\n\nA decade later, Machado said, she had turned her life around. She worked at an ophthalmologist\u2019s office, drove a BMW and had three photogenic kids. The father of her children was out of the picture, but Machado had met a kind man with a good job and they were engaged.\n\nShortly before Christmas in 2015, a routine traffic stop changed everything. Because she had an unpaid ticket, Machado was taken to a police station. There, an officer deputized to act as an immigration agent discovered Machado\u2019s felony convictions and began the process that led to her deportation.\n\nUnlike previous administrations, which had often targeted immigrants for deportation using arbitrary traffic checkpoints or workplace raids, President Obama had vowed to prioritize removals only of people with criminal convictions, saying he would target \u201cfelons not families.\u201d Machado thought she had paid her debt to society but discovered that as an immigrant in the country illegally, she didn\u2019t have the luxury of making mistakes.\n\nAfter fighting her case for 13 months, Machado was deported in January 2017. She arrived in El Salvador in shackles on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement plane.\n\nDistant relatives had offered her a place to stay in the rural hamlet of Hacienda La Carrera, but her broken Spanish and American clothing made her a target. Many homes had been abandoned by residents fleeing gangs that levied \u201ctaxes\u201d on locals and forced pretty women to be their girlfriends. In an interview in the village last year, Machado said machete-toting gang members had begun loitering outside.\n\nStill, what kept her up at night, as she listened for occasional bursts of gunfire and swatted away the mosquitoes that bit her arms and legs raw, was fear for her children: Dominic, 12; Dyanara, 11; and Dorian, 8. They were living in Siloam Springs with their grandmother, who rose before dawn to work at a meat-packing plant.\n\nMayra Machado shortly after she was deported to El Salvador in 2017. She didn't have a Salvadoran passport and didn't even know her native country's telephone code. Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times\n\nDominic still didn\u2019t know where she was but blamed himself for his mother\u2019s disappearance. At the time of the 2016 traffic stop, Machado had been returning to the store where he had left his eyeglasses.\n\nThe bright, outgoing boy, who shared his mother\u2019s wide smile and almond-shaped eyes, had become withdrawn during the months Machado spent in immigrant detention. He had started lashing out at his younger sister. His grades were slipping.\n\nMachado knew the dangers of trying to return to the United States. But, she told herself, she was a mother, and mothers are supposed to be with their kids.\n\nSo one morning in March 2017, less than three months after she was deported, Machado woke at dawn and trudged through miles of sugar cane fields toward a narrow highway, where she caught the first of many buses north.\n\nShe was finally nearing the U.S. border when a smuggler put a gun to her head.\n\nMachado had been on the migrant trail for weeks, hiding from authorities in taxi trunks and crowded tractor-trailers. She had gone days at a time without eating and had begun dreaming about what it would feel like to take a shower.\n\nBut only now, as the smuggler cocked his gun, did she realize the danger she was in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the hands of the Gulf cartel ,\u201d she thought. And then: \u201cI might die, and my children will never see their mother again.\u201d\n\nMachado had used $8,000 of her savings to pay a smuggling network that had promised a short journey to the United States. But arriving that April in Tamaulipas, the northern Mexican state where drug gangs had entered the human trafficking business, it didn\u2019t matter that Machado had paid all that cash weeks before. The smugglers said she would have to wait to cross the border until they were ready.\n\nAt a dingy safe house filled with dirty mattresses, Machado was made to cook and clean. She knew nothing about Mexican cuisine, and when she messed up while making salsa, the men threw it in her face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fat and lazy!\u201d screamed one cartel member as he beat her. Twice, Machado said, she fought off his attempts at rape.\n\nAfter months in captivity, the smugglers helped Machado cross the border. It was the Fourth of July, 2017.\n\nTwo family members picked her up in Texas and drove all night to Arkansas. Shortly before sunrise, she opened the door to the bedroom where her children were sleeping and woke them up with hugs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dreaming,\u201d they murmured.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really here.\u201d\n\nBack in Arkansas, Machado knew she had to earn back the trust of her children. Dominic had made that clear.\n\n\u201cWhy did you have to go away?\u201d he would ask on the days that he spoke to her at all.\n\nFor so long, she had lied. Finally, she decided to tell him the truth.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, and I don\u2019t have citizenship,\u201d she said. Then she told him about the forged checks: \u201cIt was the worst mistake of my life.\u201d\n\nMachado opened a map, pointed to El Salvador and showed Dominic the more than 2,000 miles she had traveled. Dominic asked if she was going to disappear again. She shook her head.\n\nIn March of this year, she and the kids moved in with her fiance, Tony, whom her youngest son had started calling Dad. But she still lived a life in the shadows. Machado didn\u2019t have an ID. Didn\u2019t have a job. On the rare occasions she drove, she scanned the rearview mirror for police.\n\nOn a hot afternoon in May, she took the risk of picking up her daughter, who had just completed fifth grade. At a roundabout, the car in front of her stopped suddenly. Machado didn\u2019t.\n\nThe woman\u2019s Mercedes was not badly damaged, and Machado offered to pay on the spot for repairs. But the driver was angry and called the police.\n\nMachado panicked. She phoned her best friend, who urged her to flee. That would be wrong, Machado said.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d her friend urged. \u201cWhen the police come, give them my name instead of yours.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Machado did, but the officer grew suspicious. Why didn\u2019t Machado\u2019s photo flash on his screen when he typed her name into his system?\n\nWhen he threatened to call a fingerprint expert, Machado started crying. \u201cMy name is Mayra,\u201d she said.\n\nThe officer charged her with a felony for obstruction of government operations. The charge was eventually dropped, but by then Machado had been flagged by ICE, and she was once again taken into immigration custody.\n\nOnly this time, she would be charged with a more serious crime.\n\nDyanara Solis, 11, from left, and her brothers Dominic, 12, and Dorian 8, in Siloam Springs, Ark. The children are living with relatives after their mother, Mayra Machado, was deported to El Salvador last year. Michael Woods / For The Times\n\nThe Washington County Detention Center in Fayetteville, Ark., is a cluster of low-slung buildings in a suburban office park. Machado has been living there for months alongside women charged with federal crimes that include drug trafficking and murder.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the U.S. government stepped up the criminal prosecution of immigrants, reversing its longtime practice of treating immigration offenses as civil matters. Machado is one of thousands of immigrants who have been charged this year with the felony crime of reentering the U.S. after a previous deportation.\n\nHer court-appointed attorney has asked Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican whose reelection campaign has been endorsed by President Trump, to pardon Machado for the check forgery, in hopes of eliminating the rationale for deporting her. A grass-roots campaign has also taken up Machado\u2019s cause, recently holding a rally outside the Arkansas prison where activists chanted \u201cFree Mama Mayra!\u201d\n\nIf those efforts fail, Machado faces up to two years in prison \u2014 followed by a second deportation.\n\nThe idea of remaining behind pains her, but it is less scary than the idea of being immediately deported again. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll be safe in prison,\u201d she said.\n\nMachado has been prescribed medication for anxiety and depression, but in phone interviews from prison, she said she still cries all day. Her only respite, she said, is a twice-weekly Bible study class \u2014 and books.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to be a mother from afar, speaking on the phone at a cost of 50 cents a minute.\n\n\u201cWho will do my hair when you\u2019re not here?\u201d her little girl asks. \u201cI want to cuddle with you,\u201d her youngest son says.\n\nDominic doesn\u2019t speak much. He spends much of his time on his PlayStation. But recently, on a phone call, he told his mother, \u201cIf you go away again, it will break my heart.\u201d\n\nIf she is eventually deported, she would not bring the kids to El Salvador, not with the gangs.\n\n\u201cWhat if they looked at my daughter the way they looked at me?\u201d she wonders. \u201cWould my son become one of them?\u201d\n\nMachado wonders, too, if she will be able to stay in El Salvador, or if she will try to reach the U.S. once again.\n\nkate.linthicum@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @katelinthicum",

  "url": "http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-spot-miles-theft-20180603-htmlstory.html#nt=barker",
  "text": "It\u2019s almost summer vacation time. Do you know where your travel rewards are? Because they may not be tucked safely in your account where you would expect to find them. They may have been stolen.\n\nThat\u2019s the word from Kevin Lee, a trust and safety architect with Sift Science, which fights digital fraud.\n\nLoyalty programs are big business in travel, of course, and many other companies (grocers, drugstores, clothing retailers, etc.). Those points you and millions of others have been stockpiling from a variety of sources are worth about $48 billion, Lee said.\n\nImpressive number. Thieves think so too. But here\u2019s where you and thieves may differ (besides the whole honesty thing): People who steal points and miles think of those awards as currency. You may think of them as a tool to get you where you want to go.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge gulf between those two mind-sets, which may result in a failure to mind your points.\n\n\u201cNot me!\u201d I thought as Lee was telling me this.\n\nYes, me. And probably you too.\n\nHere is how you can protect your stash.\n\n\u2014 Check in them, Lee said. Just as you keep an eye on your bank account, you should take a look at the accounts that have your miles, and not just every few months but once a month or more. The bigger the account, the more often you need to check in.\n\n\u2014 Practice good password hygiene. You have long since stopped using 123456 as your password, of course, and you use a different password for everything, naturally.\n\nBut do you guard that information? \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way: I\u2019ve seen [people] keep passwords on a sheet of paper under a laptop,\u201d said Brian Lapidus, practice leader, identity theft and breach notification, for Kroll, which is in the investigation and risk-mitigation business.\n\nThat\u2019s where a password manager comes in. I finally realized that if I have 125 accounts I have 125 passwords, no two alike. I need that space on my brain\u2019s hard drive for more important stuff, like where I left my car keys.\n\nThere are all kinds of password keepers, some free, some at a small cost, some that allow you access across multiple devices. Lee suggests taking a look at Tom\u2019s Guide for recommendations. You also can consult PCMag.com for its favorites.\n\n\u2014 Set up an alert when points are withdrawn, said Emily McNutt, news editor at ThePointsGuy, a travel reward website that helps people maximize points and miles.\n\n\u201cI know if I get an email that says, \u2018Thank you for using 50,000 of your points\u2019 and that wasn\u2019t me, there\u2019s an issue here,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI opt in for as many [alerts] as possible.\u201d (Check under \u201csettings\u201d on a site to see if that\u2019s where to opt in; otherwise, give your card company a call, she said.)\n\nShe also is a fan of AwardWallet.com, which helps you track your points and miles and will notify you of withdrawals.\n\n\u2014 Limit the amount of information you share on social media, said Lapidus, who said he was astounded at the number of people whose start-of-vacation selfies include their airline boarding pass.\n\nThose passes may contain your frequent-flier number, and if your password is weak, you\u2019ve set yourself up for trouble.\n\nThere is other information on that pass, none of it terribly secret, but why announce to other thieves \u2014 the kind who take stuff out of your house without your permission \u2014 that you\u2019re not home and that Granny\u2019s antique ring, hidden oh-so-insecurely in your sock drawer, is theirs for the taking?\n\n\u2014 Consider a program that monitors the dark web, where stolen information is a hot commodity, Lapidus said. This \u201cunderbelly of the web,\u201d as he called it, isn\u2019t a place for neophytes.\n\nInstead, consider a service that monitors the dark web for your information so you don\u2019t have to get your hands dirty.\n\nBut do be cautious. L.A. Times business columnist David Lazarus looked into Experian\u2019s offer to do a scan to see whether your information is on the dark web.\n\nIn return, the credit agency gets to deluge you with junk email. You would know that, Lazarus said, if only you bothered to read the 17,600-word terms of service.\n\nYou may already have that service. LifeLock, for instance, just notified me about a data breach of a site I use often. \u201cWe detected identity information belonging to you on the Dark Web, a term used which may also include the deep web or a peer-to-peer file sharing network,\u201d its explainer said.\n\n\u201cThe information found is usually from a \u2018list\u2019 that\u2019s being given away, traded or sold. The list could be old, so it\u2019s important to see whether or not the information on it is out of date.\u201d\n\nBefore you sign up with a company, check on the provider\u2019s history and background, Lapidus said, adding, \u201cConsumers can also look for independent verification, such as a high BBB [Better Business Bureau] rating to help them evaluate.\u201d\n\nThese precautions may seem like overkill. But you\u2019ll also never know whether what you do today prevents problems tomorrow.\n\nBesides, that trip to Bora-Bora may be within reach with just a few more points. In that case, the only one who should have their fingers on your dream is you.\n\nHave a travel question or dilemma? Write to travel@latimes.com.

All are drawn from our popular California Bucket List, which has grown to more than 365 entries.\n\nSan Diego\n\nCrystal Pier Hotel, Pacific Beach , San Diego. Christopher Reynolds/Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: You won't find another pier in California with cottages on it, and this pier stands along one of San Diego's most popular beaches.\n\nWhat: The Crystal Pier Hotel & Cottages go back to the 1930s. Despite changes in owners (and many a dispute with city officials) in early decades, the operation has been run by the same family since 1961. The pier is wooden, with fishing at the end. The 31 units are painted white with blue trim and flower boxes. The beachfront promenade, Ocean Front Walk, is San Diego's answer to Venice -- a boisterous concentration of people, bikes and beach culture that runs three miles through the Pacific Beach and Mission Beach neighborhoods.\n\nWhere: 4500 Ocean Blvd., San Diego, 115 miles southeast of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: Rooms (with kitchenettes) run $380 to $600 in summer, with a three-night minimum. And take note: You can't make reservations online -- just by phone and in person.\n\nJalama\n\nJalama Beach County Park, Santa Barbara County. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: Raw coastline, juicy burgers.\n\nWhat: To reach Jalama Beach County Park, you follow a twisting, two-lane highway from Lompoc to the edge of the continent and confront a horizon full of rough surf and raw, windy coastline. This campground (better for beachcombing than swimming) feels solitary, but there's a general store where they'll make you a Jalama Burger (carnivores, say yes) and sell you firewood or groceries, wine or beer. There are 109 campsites, some cabins, hot showers, a playground and a set of railroad tracks.\n\nWhere: 9999 Jalama Road, Lompoc \u2014 which is actually 18 miles southwest of Lompoc, 170 miles northwest of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: $10 per car. Jalama Burger, $7.95.\n\nBolsa Chica, Huntington Beach\n\nMike Anderson of Covina relaxes under an umbrella next to his Casita at Bolsa Chica State Beach in Huntington Beach. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: It's elementary. Homo sapiens like sitting on sand, watching water lap the shore while a bonfire crackles in a light breeze.\n\nWhat: Bolsa Chica State Beach is a prime beach bonfire destination, three miles long, with 200 fire rings available nightly (first come, first served) from 6 to 10 p.m.\n\nThat's an increasingly rare distinction. Authorities have banned fires in many coastal areas, focusing increased attention on those that remain.\n\nBolsa Chica, a long, flat beach, is also known for its surf fishing and grunion runs. Just inland you have the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, a 1,300-acre estuary and wetlands area that attracts about 200 species of birds (and almost as many sub-species of birders). There are various beach concessions nearby.\n\nWhere: Bolsa Chica, north of Huntington Beach's Seapoint Street and south of Warner Avenue, is 33 miles south of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: Day use is $15 per car.\n\nBolinas, Marin County\n\nSmiley's Schooner Saloon & Hotel, Bolinas, Calif. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: Bolinas, a lagoon-adjacent haven of 1,600 bohemian souls in an oft-overlooked corner of Marin County, has been operating incognito for decades. Locals steal road signs so that outsiders can't find their way in.\n\nNow that attitude might be softening, and the town, surrounded by hiking, surfing and kayaking opportunities, is fascinating.\n\nWhat: About 50 years ago, hardcore Bolinas locals started stealing the town's highway sign and they never stopped. The goal, conceived in back-to-the-land idealism, was to build a nature-friendly community without the distractions and economic distortions of tourism.\n\nBut as properties turn over and GPS renders signage moot, Bolinas seems to be evolving. Whether you're on the water or Wharf Road, it's a great place to think about hippie legacies and the nature of community at a time when Bay Area real estate is very nearly a blood sport.\n\nDon't expect a tourist welcome center, but if you show up mellow and humble there's no reason you shouldn't drop in for a bite at the Coast Cafe; browse the tiny but well-appointed Bolinas Museum (open Fridays through Sundays only), or drink at Smiley's Schooner Saloon and Hotel, which goes back to the 19th century.\n\nIn fact, Smiley's (which got new owners in 2015) offers live music four nights a week and rents out six rooms in back. I slept comfortably in one. On the street and in Smiley's, I was an obvious outsider with a camera around my neck, but everyone I met treated me well.\n\nYou'll see plenty of gray ponytails (and experience rotten cellphone service). And keep an eye out for BO Gas, the only nonprofit service station I've ever encountered. The rates are shockingly high ($4.66 a gallon in early August) but the money helps support the Bolinas Community Land Trust.\n\nWhere: Wharf Road, the commercial heart of town, is 25 miles northwest of San Francisco, just north of Stinson Beach, south of Point Reyes Station, 414 miles northwest of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: It's free to take a walk or check out the museum. The rooms at Smiley's go for $135-$225 nightly.\n\nInfo: There's no Bolinas Visitors Bureau \u2014 probably never will be. But there's a Marin Convention & Visitors Bureau to tell you what's nearby.\n\nLa Jolla\n\nSunny Jim Sea Cave, with kayakers beyond, in La Jolla. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: It'll make you feel like a pirate. Or a sea lion.\n\nWhat: Back in the first years of the 20th century, somebody hatched a nutty idea and hired two guys to start digging through this sandstone bluff top toward a sea cave below. And they made it.\n\nNowadays, this neighborhood's real estate prices are enough to chase mere millionaires away, but if you enter the modest-looking Cave Store and head for the rustic-looking stairwell, the tunnel remains.\n\nIts 145 steps will take you down to where waves crash and sea lions sometimes bellow. Chances are you'll also see kayakers through the opening as they make their own approach to the same cave. (The store also stocks jewelry, art and souvenirs.)\n\nThe cave was nicknamed \"Sunny Jim\" by Frank Baum (author of \"The Wizard Oz\") because the outline of the opening looks like a cartoon character called Sunny Jim who was used in advertisements for British Force Wheat cereal products in the early 20th century. (Sunny Jim had unruly hair toward the back of his head.)\n\nWhere: 1325 Coast Blvd., La Jolla, 115 miles southeast of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: $5 for adults, $3 for kids 16 and younger. Open daily. Kayak tours of the caves start at about $40.\n\nManhattan Beach\n\nCasual volleyball action, just north of the pier, in Manhattan Beach. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: If this were just any wealthy beach city, it would be a great place to run, bike, surf, people-watch and nurse your real estate envy. But Manhattan Beach is also the birthplace of beach volleyball as a way of life. Whenever you visit, you'll probably see seriously talented athletes at play.\n\nWhat: Among the South Bay beach cities of Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan, this is the northernmost and wealthiest. Plenty of restaurants and shops are lined up on Manhattan Beach Boulevard, the main drag.\n\nAt the end of the boulevard, the concrete Manhattan Beach Pier reaches 928 feet into the sea, with a cafe and the small, kid-friendly Roundhouse Aquarium at the end.\n\nThe volleyball happens on the sand courts just north and south of the pier. Besides frequent competitions there are lots of classes for kids and adults. Be warned that the Manhattan Beach Open, a summer institution since 1960, draws tens of thousands of fans, making a demanding parking situation downright diabolical.\n\nNo matter when you visit, you can read the brass plaques along the pier's Manhattan Beach Open Volleyball Walk of Fame: Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings has seven plaques there. Karch Kiraly, also an Olympic gold medalist, has 10.\n\nTake a walk along the Strand or bike the Marvin Braude Bike Trail. (Both parallel the shore).\n\nGet a beer at Rock'n Fish, a cone at the always-busy Manhattan Beach Creamery, or a meal at any hour in The Kettle. (All three are within a few blocks on Manhattan Beach Boulevard.) The Shade Hotel is a short walk away, pricey and stylish, in Metlox Plaza.\n\nWhere: The Manhattan Beach Pier is 22 miles southwest of downtown L.A., 5 miles south of LAX.\n\nHow much: Ice cream cones at the Manhattan Beach Creamery cost $5.25 for a single, $6.25 for a double. Homes along the Strand routinely fetch $10 million.\n\nSanta Monica\n\nPacific Wheel, Pacific Park, Santa Monica Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhy: Unless you charter a flight or build a better jetpack, you won't get this view of Santa Monica, the bay and city, any other way.\n\nWhat: The Santa Monica Pier went up in 1909, was largely rebuilt in the 1980s, and added an amusement park, Pacific Park, in the 1990s. Basically, it's the payoff at the end of Route 66. Its high point, about 130 feet up, is the Pacific Wheel, a Ferris wheel that started spinning in 1996.\n\nOn your way to the wheel, notice the carousel, which you might remember from the 1973 movie \"The Sting.\"\n\nOnce you're aloft, take a good look at those bright lights all around you. They were amped up in May 2016. This is billed as the world\u2019s first and perhaps only solar-powered Ferris wheel. Kids taller than 42 inches can ride alone.\n\nWhere: 380 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica, L.A. County, 16.7 miles west of downtown L.A.\n\nHow much: $10 a ride.\n\nchristopher.reynolds@latimes.com\n\nFollow Reynolds on Twitter: @MrCSReynolds",

  "url": "http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-sites-sounds-ryman-nashville-20180927-htmlstory.html",
  "text": "This was the heart of Saturday night, and honky-tonk singer-songwriter Whitey Morgan had Ryman Auditorium in an uproar.\n\nWearing a determined scowl and a long beard, Morgan prowled the stage as if looking for a fight. Now and again he\u2019d let his band, the 78\u2019s, carry the tune while he paused to pull on a bottle of whiskey.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re settin\u2019 here in the Mother Church,\u201d Morgan said, gazing at the colorful Gothic windows at the back. \u201cCome closer and sing with me.\u201d\n\nDown in front, hardcore fans raised their beers in salute. Up in the balcony, they were pounding on the oak pews and flinging fists at the ceiling.\n\nJust outside, Lower Broadway, a.k.a. the Honky Tonk Highway, was teeming with cover bands, club-hoppers and roving bachelorette parties. Two blocks south, Journey and Def Leppard had taken over the 20,000-seat Bridgestone Arena.\n\nIn the stadium across the Cumberland River, Taylor Swift was playing to a crowd of more than 50,000. And 11 miles northeast, Garth Brooks was headlining at the 4,400-seat Grand Ole Opry.\n\nNashville has music the way Willie Nelson has wrinkles. This city of 667,560 has grown so dramatically as a music industry hub, convention venue and tourist destination that if you went by the numbers, the Ryman\u2019s 2,362 seats would make it a minor player.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe building went up in 1892. And although it has hosted orchestras, opera singers and distinguished speakers, the Ryman\u2019s distinct character comes from being steeped in six generations of songs about whiskey, love, cars, joy, sorrow, farms, horses, mules, faithful dogs, faithless mates, mountains, hollows, wild flowers and lonesome train whistles.\n\nIt was home to the \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d radio show for more than 30 years. Now it hosts every stripe of country artist and a smattering of performers of just about every genre but rap.\n\nOn this stage, Bill Monroe and his band more or less created bluegrass music in 1945. One night in \u201949, lanky newcomer Hank Williams won over the crowd so thoroughly that he was called back for six yodeling encores of \u201cLovesick Blues.\u201d Johnny Cash first played here in 1956, got banned for bad behavior in 1965, returned to host a TV variety show in 1969-1971 and was mourned at a memorial in 2003.\n\nNow it was Morgan\u2019s turn at the Mother Church of country music. He brandished his guitar like a sidearm and barked happy profanities as he sang of lost souls, dead-end alleys, cocaine and old men who never gave a damn.\n\nVisit iconic music venues throughout the country \u00bb\n\nThis was a honky-tonk crowd, more Harley-Davidson than Stetson, more T-shirt than western wear. When Morgan called them brother truckers \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure that was the phrase \u2014 they roared with something like love.\n\nIt was a fine moment, and if the people who built this hall weren\u2019t already dead, it might have killed them.\n\nFrom tabernacle to \u2018Grand Ole Opry\u2019\n\nA few days later in the lobby, tour guide Jonathan Brodeur took us back to the 1880s, when the Civil War was a fresh memory and Nashville was about a tenth its current size.\n\nThomas Ryman was one of the city\u2019s richest men, having built an empire of riverboats with plenty of boozing and gambling.\n\nThen one day in May 1885, Ryman stepped into a big tent where a traveling preacher, the Rev. Sam Jones, had gathered thousands of Nashvillians. Jones launched a tirade against sin, and by the time he was done, the riverboat magnate was ready to repent.\n\nBefore long, Jones persuaded Ryman to pay for much of a new building to be shared by local and traveling preachers \u2014 a tabernacle to celebrate Nashville\u2019s newfound faith and probity.\n\nThe Gothic Revival landmark, designed by architect Hugh Cathcart Thompson, was to be built of brown brick with white trim around its tall, narrow windows. It would have a pulpit surrounded by curving wooden pews, seating thousands of worshipers. And it would stand just a block from the vice and revelry of Lower Broadway.\n\nExterior of Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. Exterior of Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. Exterior of the Ryman Auditorium, built in Gothic Revival style, in Nashville.\n\nBut what construction project ever went entirely according to plan? Years passed. Money ran low. By the time the tabernacle was completed in 1892, management needed to stage not only religious events but also secular programs, including lectures and music, to pay construction debts.\n\nBefore long, those secular shows began to reshape the space.\n\nBy 1897, the room had a new balcony, elegantly held aloft by several dozen slender steel columns, principally paid for by a Confederate veterans group. By 1901, the tabernacle\u2019s pulpit had been supplanted by a stage, the better to present opera singers.\n\nBy 1914 Ryman and Jones were both dead, and the tabernacle had been renamed Ryman Auditorium. Scheduling was handled by a former bookkeeper named Lula C. Naff, who would last more than 40 years in the job, booking whatever acts might sell, including orchestras, comedians, movies, theatrical productions, the Imperial Russian Ballet, the Hippodrome Circus, Booker T. Washington, Mae West, Helen Keller and W.C. Fields.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout Appalachia, thousands of amateur fiddlers, guitarists, banjo and mandolin players had been mixing European and African instruments, taking church tunes into the world and creating a new sort of music, rural, vital and uniquely American.\n\nThen in 1943, the music met the room. The \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d radio show, created in 1925 as a Saturday night celebration of country music and rural life, moved to the Ryman. Despite worries about rowdy crowds, Naff and \u201cOpry\u201d management agreed that the live broadcasts would fill the auditorium just about every Saturday night.\n\nView of Ryman Auditorium from the balcony in Nashville, Tennessee.

Interior of the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The balcony was mainly paid for by a Confederate veterans group in the late 1800s.\n\nBy the mid-1940s, comedian Minnie Pearl was a regular, hollering \u201cHowdy!\u201d and bringing homespun news from the half-fictional hamlet of Grinder\u2019s Switch.\n\nIn 1954 Elvis Presley sang Bill Monroe\u2019s \u201cBlue Moon of Kentucky,\u201d got a tepid response and never returned.\n\nIn 1957, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered desegregation of the nation\u2019s schools \u2014 and three years before many Nashville businesses were willing to integrate \u2014 Louis Armstrong played to a Ryman audience that was all white in the balcony, all black in the orchestra level, and targeted by an NAACP boycott.\n\nIn 1966, somebody decided that those tall, narrow windows could use some color and added red, yellow, green and blue tints, creating a stained-glass effect that made the space feel twice as ecclesiastical.\n\nBut even those who loved the Ryman had to admit that it was ungainly. No private dressing rooms. No air conditioning or elevators. And the surrounding neighborhood was getting seedy.\n\nMark Ribowsky, author of \u201cHank: The Short Life and Long Country Road of Hank Williams,\u201d writes that \u201cthe hall was cramped and dirty, smelling of urine leaking from stuffed-up bathrooms and sweat.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegularly, patrons would faint and need to be carried out into the lobby just to breathe.\u201d\n\nIt got so bad, Ribowksy wrote, that Roy Acuff, a major Nashville power broker and member of the \u201cOpry\u201d since 1938, in 1971 called it a miserable place to perform and said, \u201cI never want another note of music played in that building.\u201d\n\nThe Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, built to house preachers in the 1890s, grew into a beloved home for country musicians for much of the 20th century. (Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAnd sure enough, in 1974 the \u201cOpry\u201d fled to a bigger, custom-built hall, 11 miles northeast of downtown \u2014 but first, workers cut out a circle from the Ryman stage to install at the new venue to signal continuity.\n\nThe Ryman, apparently doomed, languished for nearly 20 years.\n\n\u2018At the Ryman\u2019\n\nBy the time Emmylou Harris and the Nash Ramblers recorded a live album there in 1991, the structure was so iffy that no one was allowed to sit on or beneath the balcony.\n\nThat left only about 200 usable seats, but Harris did three shows, savoring the chance to \u201cfeel the hillbilly dust\u201d and dance on stage with 79-year-old Bill Monroe. The resulting record and documentary, \u201cAt the Ryman\u201d (1992), rallied public support for the rescue and restoration of the old hall.\n\nIn 1992 the building\u2019s owner, now known as Ryman Hospitality Partners, announced plans for major renovations. In 1994 the auditorium reopened and a new era dawned.\n\nAddition to the Ryman Auditorium after renovations. Albert Vecerka\n\nToday the Ryman hosts about 200 shows a year, including visits from the \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d every winter and occasional church services and funerals. About 250,000 people a year book tours. The escorted version runs about 40 minutes, takes you through dressing rooms and onto the stage, and costs about $35.\n\nAnd on stage, the story continues to unfold. In April 2017 Loretta Lynn marked her 85th birthday by performing a pair of sold-out Ryman shows.\n\nFive months later, 23-year-old pop singer Harry Styles , formerly of One Direction, made his Ryman debut, telling the audience: \u201cWhen we booked this tour, this was kind of the reason. This room.\u201d\n\nIn August, as Morgan rollicked toward the end of his gig, he was just as reverent about the room but gruffer. He even bowed to history by covering favorites from Roger Miller and John Prine.\n\nThen Morgan went back to his own lyrics, celebrating sinning, whiskey and just about everything that the Ryman\u2019s builders wanted to wipe from this world. Behind him, the 78\u2019s rocked ruggedly enough to offend any \u201cOpry\u201d purist.\n\nIn other words, the Ryman has been soiled. And saved. And my first night there was \u2014cover your ears, Rev. Jones \u2014 a hell of a show.\n\nWhitey Morgan and his band, the 78s, play Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nLive music in Nashville\n\nThe Ryman is just one of Nashville\u2019s many live-music options.

  "text": "\u201cDancing Aloud,\u201d a sign said. On stage, guitarist Corey Dennison, 43, white and well tattooed, had just opened an instrumental conversation with a grandfatherly figure in a White Sox cap.\n\n\u201cThis is my old man, Mr. Carl Weathersby ,\u201d Dennison told the crowd. \u201cHe taught me everything I know about the blues.\u201d\n\nWeathersby, 65, and African American, nodded. The notes rose, fell and tangled like family voices around a dinner table. The players, related only by a passion for music, grinned and winced the way soloists do.\n\nIn the audience 100 blues lovers roared, clapped, drank and chattered in three or four languages.\n\nThis was Kingston Mines, the oldest, biggest club of its kind in Chicago, on a recent Monday night. Like the rest of the international audience, I was here to listen to an embattled American sound \u2014 Chicago-style electric blues, born in the mid-20th century as African American families moved north from the Mississippi Delta.\n\nIn that migration, legions of country blues musicians traded their acoustic guitars for electrics, started playing their harmonicas through microphones and launched an era of rough-edged, streetwise music, sibling to soul, cousin to gospel.\n\nThe sound filled mostly black clubs on Chicago\u2019s south and west sides. New arrivals played for tips on Maxwell Street, and the biggest names released albums on Chess Records and blazed a musical path that rock \u2019n\u2019 roll soon would follow.\n\nBut Chicago and pop culture have moved on. Though the vast, free Chicago Blues Festival takes over Millennium Park every June, and the locally headquartered Delmark and Alligator labels release new blues and roots tunes, rap music now dominates the South and West sides.\n\nYou must go to the Loop and north, where the tourists are, to find the remaining handful of all-blues clubs.\n\nI wanted to see and hear them before things changed any more, so I spent three days and nights this summer chasing Chicago blues through five clubs, one museum exhibition and one storied old studio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just real\u201d Corey Dennison\n\nSinger-guitarist Corey Dennison plays at Kingston Mines blues club in Chicago. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nKingston Mines, born in the late 1960s and a fixture on Halsted Street in Lincoln Park since 1982, was my first stop.\n\nAlthough the surrounding neighborhood is collegiate, urban and prosperous, the club aims for a rural juke-joint feel, with fried okra and catfish fingers on the menu, a map of \u201cblues country\u201d on the wall and tangles of Christmas lights here and there. It\u2019s too big to be called intimate, too gritty to be mistaken for a House of Blues .\n\nIt features two stages (so two bands can alternate sets without long delays in between) and a kitchen (Doc\u2019s Rib Joint). The live music plays until about 3:45 a.m. every night except Saturday into Sunday when it lasts an hour longer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty much no place I know like this on the planet,\u201d said Joanna Connor, a singer and guitarist who has played at the club for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just real, man. It\u2019s real people,\u201d Dennison told me.\n\nSinger-guitarist Corey Dennison and veteran bluesman Carl Weathersby relax at Kingston Mines blues club in Chicago. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nDr. Lenin Pellegrino, a general practitioner and social crusader, owned the club for decades, relying on an audience that\u2019s a mix of locals, tourists and students from nearby DePaul University . \u201cDoc\u201d Pellegrino died in May at age 92. His grown children run the club.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an integrating force,\u201d manager Lisa Pellegrino told me. \u201cWe have people sitting here who, back home, their countries are at war.\u201d\n\nAs I chatted with the musicians between sets, I learned how Weathersby broke in as a guitarist for bluesmen Albert King and Billy Branch, started his own group, then hired Dennison and mentored him for years.\n\nNowadays Dennison and his band play two nights a week at Kingston Mines. Weathersby, who has moved out of state, had dropped by to listen.\n\nAs in all the clubs I checked out, the monthly schedule showed a mix of black and white performers, mostly homegrown. The audiences were probably less than 10% black and included a lot of blues-hungry visitors from Europe and Asia.\n\nMore than once, I thought of a question Chicago Tribune music critic Howard Reich posed in 2011: \u201cHow long can a black musical art form remain dynamic when presented to a largely white audience in settings designed to replicate and merchandise the real thing?\u201d\n\nI have no answer. But the music, done right, still thrills. Stories of loss and longing. Bursts of wild exhilaration. Moments of understanding that reach beyond age and race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s electric folk music,\u201d Bruce Iglauer, the Chicago-based founder of Alligator Records, told me. \u201cAnd folk music changes as the folks change.\u201d\n\nJ.W. Williams and his band play Kingston Mines, a blues club on Halsted Street in Chicago. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times Kingston Mines, a blues club on Chicago's Halsted Street in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, dates back to 1968. (Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times) Kingston Mines, a blues club on Chicago's Halsted Street in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, dates back to 1968. (Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times)\n\nWhatever the future, there is plenty of blues culture to see and hear this year in the city. At the Chicago History Museum, I browsed through the \u201cAmplified: Chicago Blues\u201d exhibition (through Aug. 10, 2019), which includes vintage photos of wild nights in long-gone South Side clubs; hands-on features inviting you to sing or play guitar (with the amp\u2019s distortion level set to good \u2019n\u2019 crunchy); and an introduction to many of the region\u2019s key players.\n\nFrom Mississippi came Muddy Waters to sing \u201cMannish Boy,\u201d Howlin\u2019 Wolf to sing \u201cSmokestack Lightnin\u2019,\u201d Bo Diddley to lay down the five-beat syncopated rhythm that drives \u201cWho Do You Love?,\u201d Willie Dixon to write \u201cHoochie Coochie Man\u201d and shape the Chicago blues scene for years as a bassist and producer.\n\nFrom Tennessee came Koko Taylor to sing \u201cWang Dang Doodle.\u201d From Louisiana came harmonica player Little Walter and guitarist Buddy Guy, now 82 and still performing at his club, Buddy Guy\u2019s Legends.\n\nSites and sounds: Visit iconic music venues throughout the country \u00bb\n\nA heaping of history\n\nMy other daytime stop was Willie Dixon\u2019s Blues Heaven Foundation, a surprisingly compact building that housed Chess Records from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. There, tour guide Janine Judge led me upstairs to the studio where Waters, Diddley, Taylor and Dixon did some of their best work.\n\nThis was also where Chuck Berry recorded \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d in 1958 and Etta James recorded \u201cAt Last\u201d in 1960; where the Rolling Stones recorded a smoldering instrumental track titled \u201c2120 South Michigan Avenue\u201d in 1964 while on their first U.S. tour.\n\nJudge, carrying a portable speaker, cranked up the volume on classic songs and pointed out the late Dixon\u2019s old bass in one corner.\n\nWillie Dixon's Blues Heaven Foundation is where Chess Records used to be. Displays include life masks of blues greats, some living, some dead. Bobby Bland, seen here, died in 2013. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nShe explained how brothers Leonard and Phil Chess built the label and how Dixon sued Led Zeppelin decades ago, accusing the band of using his words and music in the songs \u201cBring It on Home\u201d and \u201cWhole Lotta Love.\u201d This led to settlement payments, amount undisclosed. Without that cash, who knows whether this building would still be standing?\n\nBy night I club-hopped, paying cover charges of $5 to $12.\n\nAt B.L.U.E.S. on Halsted, down the street from Kingston Mines, I stepped in just as host Big Ray was asking the out-of-towners where they were from (England, Hungary, Australia).\n\nThe club, snug and narrow, holds about 60 people. The stage was so small that the bass player sat on the keyboard of an upright piano.\n\nThis bar is known for musicians often sitting in \u2014 \u201cmore jamming, more surprises,\u201d Iglauer said \u2014 and many a music lover has spent an evening wandering back and forth between B.L.U.E.S. and Kingston Mines.\n\nAt Rosa\u2019s Lounge the scene is similarly intimate, and the hospitality has a homespun Italian inflection. Italian immigrant (and drummer) Tony Mangiullo opened the place in 1984, and it\u2019s been a fixture in the Logan Square neighborhood.\n\nI showed up on a slow weekday night \u2014 fewer than 10 customers were inside and nobody on the street outside. On stage, Nigel Mack, a singer and multi-instrumentalist, was working without his usual guitarist. That meant we didn\u2019t get the harmonica heroics Mack is known for, but I was happy to sit up close and admire his slide guitar work.\n\nRosa's Lounge is a longtime blues club in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago. Nigel Mack, who sings and plays slide guitar and harmonica, recently headlined. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe city\u2019s blues scene \u201cgoes up and it goes down,\u201d Mack told me during a break. \u201cBut the state of the blues has got to be healthier here than it is anywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\nAt Buddy Guy\u2019s Legends, a posh place next to the Hilton in the South Loop, I caught Mz Peachez and Her Casanovas.\n\nSitting in the palm of nature: The unique energy \u2014 and performances \u2014 of Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheatre \u00bb\n\nIf I were smarter, I\u2019d have arrived early enough to order dinner \u2014those who reserve ahead and sit to eat get the best spots. While I stood in back, Mz Peachez assessed her crowd and veered from standard blues titles to disco favorites \u201cBad Girls\u201d and \u201cI Will Survive.\u201d\n\nMaybe a few purists were offended, but dozens of Brazilian tourists jumped out of their seats to dance. (I\u2019m guessing that medley doesn\u2019t happen in January, when Guy himself usually does a month-long residency.)\n\nBuddy Guy's Legends has been a popular blues club in Chicago since its opening in 1989. Mz. Peachez and Her Casanovas played there on June 19. Christopher Reynolds / Los Angeles Times\n\nAt the House of Blues in the heavily touristed River North area, I was too early for live music but got a juicy burger with sweet potato fries. To those who would say that patronizing the House of Blues in Chicago is like eating at Taco Bell in Los Angeles, I can only say: Yes, it is. But it books a lot of local blues acts, often two per night.\n\nOn my last night in town, I circled back to Kingston Mines, where Dennison again was prowling the stage, singing Willie Nelson\u2019s lyrics about how \u201cthe nightlife ain\u2019t no good life, but it\u2019s my life.\u201d\n\nWeathersby was in the audience again, this time in a Cubs hat.\n\n\u201cThe things that blues are about \u2014 they aren\u2019t going away as long as there\u2019s people,\u201d he told me. With players such as Dennison on the scene, Weathersby added, \u201cIt\u2019s in good hands for another 20 years.\u201d\n\nThen up on stage, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 invited him to sit in, and the guitars started talking.\n\nIf you go\n\nThe best way to Chicago\n\nFrom LAX, United, American, Delta, Alaska and Frontier offer nonstop and connecting service (change of planes) to Chicago.

  "text": "It was a half-cloudy night at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, with boulders looming and distant lightning in the eastern sky. Singer Colin Meloy was on stage with the Decemberists, chatting up the audience.\n\n\u201cThere are very few places to play in the world that still make me nervous, and this is one of them,\u201d said Meloy, who has been touring for almost 20 years. \u201cIt feels like we should be giving a talk on grizzly bear management.\u201d\n\nRed Rocks, 16 miles southwest of downtown Denver, is an American outdoor music venue like no other.\n\nThe stage and audience areas are sheltered between a pair of 300-foot monoliths, Ship Rock and Creation Rock, and another boulder anchored behind the stage bounces sound forward. Whether you\u2019re in the audience or on stage, occupying Red Rocks is like being held in the palm of a vast sandstone hand.\n\nI recently caught two shows here and spent several more hours exploring the trails, slopes and meadows of Red Rocks Park, which covers 966 acres.\n\nIf you are a sonic purist, this might not be your place \u2014 too many visual distractions. But for the rest of us, it\u2019s a double thrill.\n\nIn the rocks you see nature improvising over the slow click-track of the long geological clock. On stage, there\u2019s a human invention every moment.\n\nAnd every once in a while, human and natural events align in startling ways.\n\nIn a video at the venue visitor center, Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools recalls the day Red Rocks audience members roared their approval when he was in the middle of a song. Just as he was congratulating himself, he glanced up and realized that the fans were cheering a double rainbow overhead.\n\nBeyond the venue\n\nShow up at dawn, when the early light plays on the boulders, and the only music you\u2019ll hear at Red Rocks is birdsong.\n\nStill, you won\u2019t be alone. Besides the 1.3 million concertgoers it drew last year, Red Rocks also attracted an estimated 1.2 million tourists and hikers who never heard a note.\n\nThe park opens daily an hour before sunrise, and if there\u2019s no show that night it stays open until an hour after sunset. (The performance season is April through October.)\n\nFitness buffs huff and puff up and down the amphitheater aisles all year long, and wise ones keep their eyes open. Skunks, rattlesnakes and deer appear regularly.\n\nPeople gather to watch the sunrise from the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times) People walk the Geologic Overlook Trail, with Creation Rock in the background. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nOn show days \u2014 which is almost every day in summer\u2014 the venue closes to visitors in early afternoon. But the trails stay busy, especially the Trading Post Trail.\n\nLou Spirito For The Times\n\nThat route covers 1.4 mostly flat miles through foliage and around rock formations. I encountered no critters on the path in the middle of a spring weekday, but I had plenty of human company, including Jennifer Forsha, a Littleton, Colo., resident who hikes the rocks almost every weekend with her husband and two kids.\n\n\u201cWe run up the trail and we run up the amphitheater,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see all this beautiful stuff. And if you go up to the amphitheater, it\u2019s a bunch of amazing energy.\u2026 It\u2019s my happy place.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll never know who first made music among the boulders. But historians say the site was a longtime gathering point for native people. And we know that by 1906, a promoter named John Brisben Walker had bought the property, named it the Garden of the Titans and set up a wooden platform.\n\nIf you go up to the amphitheater, it\u2019s a bunch of amazing energy.\u2026 It\u2019s my happy place.\u201d Jennifer Forsha\n\nPietro Satriano and his 25-piece brass band played that May. Five years later, soprano Mary Garden sang opera.\n\nIn years to follow, Walker staged all sorts of events in the area and built a funicular railway, later scrapped.\n\nThe city of Denver acquired the amphitheater site in 1927, and architect Burnham Hoyt came up with the plans. Civilian Conservation Corps workers, grateful for work in the middle of the Great Depression, started swinging picks and shovels in 1936 or 1937, often earning $1 per day.\n\nBy 1941, the workers had sculpted the space between Ship and Creation rocks into 70 rows for wooden benches, the aisles flanked by juniper trees. Then, as now, there was room for about 9,500 people.\n\nThe rock amphitheater outside of Denver is a music venue and a place to hike.\n\nThe visitor center, open to concertgoers and sightseers alike, was added in 2007. There\u2019s room for the Ship Rock Grille and a Red Rocks artists\u2019 hall of fame. There\u2019s also a Colorado Music Hall of Fame in the Trading Post building, with a bronze statue in front of \u2014 did you guess it? \u2014 John Denver.\n\nMeanwhile, performers enjoy dressing rooms built around rock formations. In the tunnel between the sound-mixing board and backstage, generations of musicians have made their marks. (Styx, it seems, travels with a stencil.)\n\nThrough the early 1950s, the schedule was short and dominated by classical music, opera and ballet, with each season opened by an Easter sunrise service.\n\nThen pop culture crept in.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Jerry Lewis was doing stand-up, Ella Fitzgerald was scat-singing and Ricky Nelson was playing. Ray Charles appeared in 1962 but did such a short, slapdash show that the audience pelted the stage with beer cans and management briefly imposed an alcohol ban.\n\nThe Beatles played in 1964 (leaving about 2,500 tickets unsold at $6.60 each). Jimi Hendrix came in 1968. When Jethro Tull appeared in 1971, legions of ticket-less fans tried to breach a fence, security forces let loose with tear gas and a five-year rock \u2019n\u2019 roll ban began.\n\nFans listen as Phantogram/Tycho performs at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nBy the late \u201970s, the amphitheater was again busy with rock and just about every other genre. In 1978 Steve Martin brought down the house with \u201cKing Tut,\u201d a performance audible on his album \u201cA Wild and Crazy Guy.\u201d\n\nFive years later, a young U2 played amid fog and rain, a show featured in the film \u201cU2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky.\u201d\n\nAni DiFranco has sung about reproductive freedom here, John Tesh about God. The Moody Blues crooned \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d with the Colorado Symphony providing full orchestral pomp. On April 20, 2014, Red Rocks began its day with an Easter sunrise service and ended with a Snoop Dogg show.\n\n\u201cI did 37 shows last year,\u201d usher Ben Miller, 33, told me one night. \u201cEvery show definitely does have a different energy to it.\u201d His favorite performance: the alternative band Gorillaz last September.\n\n\u201cIt was raining most of the time, but sometimes that makes a better show,\u201d Miller said.\n\nIf you sit in Row 33 or higher, you can see the horizon beyond the stage, but it sometimes gets windy. Lightning or hail occasionally forces a delay or cancellation. And because the stage is about 6,450 feet above sea level, performers sometimes come up short of breath. The crew keeps oxygen canisters backstage.\n\nHigh-energy music\n\nDon\u2019t miss the year-by-year timeline of performers when you browse the visitor center. You\u2019ll notice that the venue gets busier as the economy booms and slower when it slumps (the early 1990s and late 2000s, for instance). As recently as 2012, the Red Rocks performance year included just 78 concerts.\n\nBut it\u2019s booming now, with 161 nights booked for this year\u2014 including about 30 nights of EDM \u2014 electronic dance music. Just as jam bands such as the Grateful Dead, Blues Traveler and Widespread Panic played a key role at Red Rocks in the \u201990s and \u201900s, EDM shows have multiplied lately. In fact, those shows\u2019 thundering bass lines have prompted new volume limits.\n\nA display of every act that has performed at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times) Posters for acts that have played at the amphitheatre line a wall. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cThe crowd is very high energy,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of drug use.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Red Rocks spokesman Brian Kitts about that, he suggested that every new generation of pop music seems to provoke a similar set of complaints. In the larger picture, he said, \u201cI have a hard time believing that having EDM is any different than having Metallica on stage.\u201d\n\nJust my luck \u2014 I missed EDM and Metallica. But I did catch Phantogram, a rock band that favors electronica, often slips into spacey dance grooves and uses lots of light effects and projections. In short, this was a marijuana-friendly band. (Though weed is banned from the amphitheater, enforcement is imperfect.) The house was packed, happy and mostly younger than 30.\n\nThere are very few places to play in the world that still make me nervous, and this is one of them.\u201d Colin Meloy\n\nColin Meloy of the Decemberists during a performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nI returned the next night for the Decemberists. It was a smaller crowd, mostly older than 30 and many older than 50, like me. But from the opening notes of \u201cEverything Is Awful\u201d \u2014 the band\u2019s first song \u2014 it was a happy night.\n\nI joined in when the audience rose and started calling for an encore. For a long neo-tribal moment we all stood clapping, glancing at each other, the boulders and the sky.\n\nThen the band was back, dragging a mysterious canister. Meloy pointed at it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough oxygen for one more!\u201d he shouted.\n\nNear Red Rocks\n\nStroll tiny downtown Morrison (population about 430), which lies two miles southeast of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Have a look at Bear Creek, see the old white Morrison Chapel and browse the shops along Bear Creek Avenue, the main street.\n\nTry breakfast or lunch at the Cow an Eatery. Before you head to a show at Red Rocks, maybe have a game dinner at the Fort.\n\nAlso, stop in at the Buffalo Bill Museum & Grave on Lookout Mountain, which celebrates the life and times of outdoorsman and showman Buffalo Bill Cody (1846-1917). The museum features Wild West show posters and artifacts. As for the gift shop\u2014 you\u2019ve never seen so many refrigerator magnets.\n\nA coffee shop in the tiny town of Morrison, Colo. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nGolden, 8 miles north of the amphitheater, is another worthwhile town near Red Rocks. It\u2019s best known for the Coors Brewery, and, yes, there are tours.\n\nBut you may prefer to walk Washington Street and admire the \u201cHowdy Folks!\u201d sign overhead. Check out the path along Clear Creek, where there are often kayakers. Try the pizza at Woody\u2019s Wood-Fired Pizza. If you like, eat it at a picnic table on the bridge over Clear Creek.\n\nThe Origin Hotel is supposed to open by the end of the summer. Rates start at $212, dipping to $169 in November. (It was still a construction site when I visited.)\n\nIf you go\n\nTHE BEST WAY TO DENVER\n\nFrom LAX, American, United, Delta, Alaska, Frontier and Southwest offer nonstop service to Denver, and American, Delta, United, Southwest and Alaska offer connecting service (change of planes). Restricted round-trip airfare from $151, including taxes and fees.\n\nWHERE TO EAT\n\nThe Cow an Eatery, 316 Bear Creek Ave., Morrison, Colo.; (303) 697-5721. This casual place has a pleasant patio and is popular for breakfast and lunch. Most main dishes $8-$15.\n\nThe Fort, 19192 Highway 8, Morrison; Colo.; (303) 697-4771. It\u2019s a re-creation of an early 19th century fort. Most steaks cost $40-$64. Bison, beef and quail are specialties. (I had the bison sirloin fixed-price combo with potatoes, greens and quail for $39.) Nice views and fire pits on the patio.\n\nWoody\u2019s Wood-fired Pizza, 1305 Washington Ave., Golden, Colo.; (303) 277-0443. Good pizza, festive atmosphere, and a novelty: Diners are encouraged to pour a dollop of local honey on their crusts. Most pizzas $12-$23.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nThe Crawford Hotel, Union Station, 1701 Wynkoop St., Denver; (720) 460-3700. Opened in 2014.

  "text": "When David Kaplan and Jenna Gerbino first laid eyes on their wedding venue, it was love at first sight. Kaplan, who co-owns East Village cocktail mecca Death & Co., and his publicist fianc\u00e9e were instantly smitten with the North Fork vineyard Bedell Cellars. More than just the acclaimed pours or stylish winery, though, it was the gorgeous surroundings that seduced them; they married there last June.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so close to the city, but you feel a million miles away \u2014 you can escape to this completely other world,\u201d raves Kaplan, who calls the combination of great beaches and wineries a \u201ctwo for one.\u201d Indeed, Long Island\u2019s East End is arguably one of the world\u2019s most romantic places, and its breathtaking reputation has made this slim spit of land a mecca for perfect dates, proposals and weddings.\n\nKelli Delaney, who runs the lifestyle bible KDHamptons and married her husband, Dr. Mark Kot, in Southampton, points out that the Hamptons are not only romantic but photogenic \u2014 increasingly critical in our Insta-world. \u201cIt\u2019s so rare that within a matter of five minutes\u2019 drive you could go from a farm stand to one of the best beaches in the country,\u201d she tells Alexa. \u201cThere is something magical about the light, the way it hits the water, so wedding photos are extra gorgeous.\u201d\n\nTo guarantee such swoony snaps, stake out a choice spot \u2014 like the bright-red St. Andrew\u2019s Dune Church (call it Dune, like the locals) and its glorious gardens in Southampton, or Jack Lenor Larsen\u2019s art-filled 16-acre estate and sculpture garden, LongHouse Reserve, in East Hampton. Also in the heart of East Hampton, Mulford Farm makes for a perfect ceremony venue; the rare, intact English colonial from 1680 overlooks the village\u2019s iconic windmills.\n\nVineyards like Bedell or Sagaponack\u2019s famous W\u00f6lffer Estate (celebrating its 30th anniversary this summer) have become iconic for bucolic walks down the aisle. Public-relations exec Britta Towle Morris married her financier husband, Rowan Morris, at W\u00f6lffer two summers ago; the couple had long considered it their favorite date-night spot. \u201cWe have been going to W\u00f6lffer for years to celebrate everything from Valentine\u2019s Day to birthdays to New Year\u2019s, so when we got engaged, it was one of the first places I thought of,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat makes it so special is you can sit there, on a beautiful outside terrace, and see the sun setting over the vineyards for dinner.\u201d\n\nCinephiles Kendra and Nathaniel Feeley, meanwhile, hosted their 2013 wedding at the (now-closed) Montauk Movies. \u201cNat and I bonded over movies throughout our relationship \u2014 cinema was a motif of our romance,\u201d she tells Alexa. \u201cOur names were on the marquee, we had popcorn, Champagne and old-timey movie candies for the guests. And before the ceremony, we had a slideshow movie playing as a preview.\u201d You can stage a similar scene as soon as the fire-ravaged Sag Harbor Cinema is rebuilt \u2014 construction is slated to begin this summer.\n\nWedding planner Sarah Duke of Duke + Van Deusen in East Hampton says marrying out east has another advantage: expertise. Caterers and tent-rental companies are total pros, thanks to the surfeit of charity benefits and parties held in the area by demanding socialites every summer. She suggests considering a wedding weekend in July, which is now often less busy than June or September when it comes to working with those vendors (couples have started shying away from what they assume is peak season).\n\nAnd always make a Hamptons wedding a three-day \u2014 not a one-evening \u2014 event: perhaps a beach clambake on Friday, a swanky ceremony on Saturday and a kitschy pool party come Sunday morning. Then again, the relaxed rules here mean you can make the entire event into a giant beach party, as one of Duke\u2019s clients did.\n\n\u201cThe wedding favors were beach bags filled with sunscreen and towels, and after the ceremony the guests changed into their bathing suits for a party on a beach in front of the groom\u2019s grandmother\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nThe Hamptons are also the perfect spot for those ready to propose, as financier Michael Van Camp discovered last summer. He was dining at Calissa in Water Mill with his now-fianc\u00e9, web developer Chris McLaughlin, and a group of friends. Swinging on the hanging chairs on its terrace, \u201cHe just looked at me and proposed. It was entirely spontaneous,\u201d Van Camp recalls (they will marry at the same spot this fall).\n\nDelaney of KDHamptons says she frequently sees such impromptu proposals on summer weekends. Those who plan ahead, meanwhile, will often book a photographer (she recommends Deborah Kalas) to lurk unobtrusively and capture the moment. For a showstopping question-popping, Delaney suggests hiring a catamaran from Heron Charters for a sunset cruise before sailing in to Montauk\u2019s Navy Beach, where you can prearrange to meet a party of your pals.\n\nThe Hamptons can rekindle the spark for long-established couples, too. Why not take a hike together through the 2,000-plus acres of the wildlife-filled Mashomack Preserve on Shelter Island (look for the nests of breeding eagle pairs), amble down the dreamy Cooper\u2019s Beach in Southampton at sunset or tackle the rugged beachfront at Montauk\u2019s Shadmoor State Park? There you can clamber over the cliffs down to the surfing beach at Ditch Plains and share burritos and iced coffee from beloved kitchen trailer Ditch Witch. Sip a freshly made mai tai at Lynn\u2019s Hula Hut, a romantic tiki bar on Montauk Pier, or cuddle under a blanket for an al fresco surf \u2019n\u2019 turf supper at Duryea\u2019s. If you want to be both smart and sexy, there\u2019s nowhere better than the wood-paneled rooms and deep-leather armchairs of the East Hampton Public Library.\n\nBut a warning: If you embrace the sentimental side of this sliver of Long Island, expect the Hamptons to become a permanent fixture in your relationship. The Kaplans plan to return to Bedell next month for their first anniversary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get the wedding crew back together for a day for a catch-up and wine tasting,\u201d he says. \u201cI imagine we\u2019ll make it a yearly thing.\u201d",

  "text": "Where Long Island splits in two at the Peconic River \u2014 technically at the township of Riverhead \u2014 there\u2019s both a physical and a psychological divide. The South Fork is home to the tony Hamptons, where dressing for dinner is an art form; the North Fork, meanwhile, has for generations remained the stomping ground of farmers, fishermen and, in the past 30 years, winemakers.\n\nNow, acclaimed chefs and food influencers are quietly planting flags on these fertile grounds, from Southold to Orient Point.\n\n\u201cTop Chef\u201d judge Tom Colicchio \u2014 who originally oversaw the kitchen of Gramercy Tavern and now leads his own Craft restaurant empire, as well as the menu at Temple Court and the new Alley Cat in the Beekman Hotel \u2014 was an early arrival, buying a circa-1850 home in Mattituck 17 years ago.\n\n\u201cMy wife spent summers in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and I spent summers at the Jersey Shore, so we split the difference,\u201d he tells Alexa. In the nearly two decades since they set down roots out east, the area has changed dramatically \u2014 but not intrinsically.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people here who had a career in banking or management consulting and wanted to bail out of the city,\u201d Colicchio explains, and those folks are now putting their energy toward North Fork food projects. \u201cIt used to be just cauliflower and broccoli and potatoes. Now Holly Browder of Browder\u2019s Birds has the best chickens I\u2019ve ever eaten, Sang Lee is doing organic farming, there are at least three different oyster growers, people are planting hops for the local brewers.\u201d\n\nHe goes to his North Fork house every weekend he can during the year and decamps there full time starting in June. He cooks for friends and neighbors and lets his kids run as wild as Browder\u2019s chickens. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of pace and community we thought was long gone,\u201d he says.\n\nColicchio might run into fellow North Forkers like Bon App\u00e9tit editor Adam Rapoport or President Obama\u2019s former chef, Sam Kass, but mostly he doesn\u2019t leave his garden except to buy cheese at the Village Cheese Shop or hit up his former colleague Claudia Fleming\u2019s food truck, which roams the region.\n\n\u201cOnce I\u2019m out in Mattituck for the summer, I\u2019m in shorts and T-shirts and flipflops,\u201d he admits.\n\nMost of us know each other already, so that makes it nice. - Andrew Carmellini\n\nFleming followed her boss (she won the James Beard Award for outstanding pastry chef in 2000, while working at Gramercy Tavern) out east and never left. She and her late husband bought a home in Southold in 2004 and soon after opened the four-guestroom North Fork Table & Inn, undeniably the social hub of the area.\n\n\u201cWhen we first came, there were really no restaurants catering to the inweries,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cSo it seemed like a perfect pairing.\u201d In the past several years, only a few other restaurants have opened, but she can source food from new local cattle ranches, pig farms and goats making milk for cheese.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting. From 8 Hands Farm and Deep Roots Farm, we get whole animals. McCall, one of the better wineries, started raising 100-percent grass-fed beef. On Friday nights, we take our food truck to McCall winery and serve hamburgers from their beef. It\u2019s super fun and very intimate. You meet all the other people who have slowed down and recognize the benefits of this prospering community.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Fleming is being honored by Dan\u2019s Chefs of the North Fork on July 7 for her commitment to the region. The dinner is being hosted at the Halyard, one of the few other sit-down restaurants to open in the North Fork, set inside the waterfront Sound View hotel in Greenport.\n\nThe Halyard launched last fall, overseen by chef Galen Zamarra, also a James Beard Award winner and owner of Mas (Farmhouse) in the West Village. He\u2019s been doing a house-share in Southold since 2003.\n\n\u201cThe restaurant scene then was just bad. It wasn\u2019t even local food \u2014 it was frozen!\u201d he recalls.\n\nBut he could ride his bike from vineyard to vineyard and farm to farm. He\u2019s still a fan of the honor-system farm stands and the Fifth Street Beach, and will occasionally go out to dinner with his wife and two kids at places like 1943 Pizza Bar for woodfired pies or Caci for Italian. He\u2019s excited about Peconic Escargot farm\u2019s PawPaw and chef Frank DeCarlo\u2019s pop-ups. \u201cIt is a very quiet, leisurely life,\u201d he says.\n\nLots of Zamarra\u2019s food-world friends have also fallen in love with that laid-back lifestyle. \u201cMost of us know each other already, so that makes it nice,\u201d says chef Andrew Carmellini, owner of Manhattan\u2019s the Dutch and Locanda Verde \u2014 and a Cutchogue home he bought three years ago. \u201cI\u2019m buying lambs that are pastured down the street and chickens for my personal use and having people over for dinner.\u201d\n\nHe just partnered with local purveyor Farm Beyond to grow all the vegetables for two of his city restaurants, on just two acres. \u201cI have been living in the city most of my life, so I\u2019m less the patient farmer than I am the feverish eater. We\u2019re harvesting already,\u201d he says. Look for North Fork-fresh tomatoes, peppers and eggplant at Leuca and Little Park in early June.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect the area to become the \u201cnext Brooklyn,\u201d as so many publications proclaim. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of vibe,\u201d notes Carmellini. \u201cWe are generally socializing at the house as opposed to going out. We go to the beach, where we have a fire pit and kayaks, and we do a lot of bike riding.\u201d\n\nOne thing you\u2019ll never see: a future Carmellini restaurant near the North Fork Jitney stop.\n\n\u201cEvery year a piece of property comes up, and someone asks if I\u2019ll open something, but I\u2019m all business in town,\u201d says the chef. \u201cSo when I\u2019m out here, I don\u2019t want to worry about making brunch.\u201d",

  "url": "https://nypost.com/2018/10/09/biker-shorts-to-genius-collabs-the-best-moments-from-milan-spring-2019-fashion-week/",
  "text": "From biker shorts to parachute pants, Milan embraced the sportier side of spring fashion. I was on hand (@johannahmasters) for all the action, soaking up trends that will soon be dominating the streets (if they aren\u2019t already). Eye-catching ensembles were everywhere, from Prada\u2019s embellished, tie-dye dresses to Etro\u2019s patchwork jeans. Dolce & Gabbana celebrated its always-evolving DNA, while Moncler unveiled its second Genius collection. Dive into the Italian festa.\n\nShorts story\n\nBiker shorts rolled onto nearly every runway in Milan. Blumarine layered evening dresses over neon pairs, while Salvatore Ferragamo kept a handle(bar) on a sleek and sophisticated workday look. Fendi saluted the bottoms\u2019 athletic beginnings with matching sports-bra-and-shorts sets. Both GCDS and Roberto Cavalli, meanwhile, pedaled streetwear chic.\n\nChutes away\n\nWhat\u2019s cool-kid approved and lighter than air for spring? Perfectly restyled parachutes. Byblos floated functional, swishy pants; Giorgio Armani jumped on the trend with a pretty-in-pink skirt; and Sportmax nailed the landing with layered, multicolor jackets.\n\nTo dye for\n\nTie-dye has once again found its way into the jet-set closet. MSGM showed multicolor denim, serving an \u201980s throwback feel. No. 21 and Prada both focused on statement dresses with bow accents and embellishments for a more contemporary take.\n\nDream jeans\n\nDenim decked out models from head to toe in Milan, but these over-the-top jeans had us singing the blues. Beaded fringe, crystal motifs and feathers truly stole the show at Vivetta. Etro\u2019s patchwork and Versace\u2019s floral cargos evoke denim heydays of decades past \u2014 in the most wearable ways.\n\nIn the trenches\n\nThe trench is the coat of spring, ovviamente! But the classic jacket got a fresh spin in Milan. Max Mara\u2019s rubberized jersey, polka-dot number provides the ultimate protection from downpours, while Agnona and Stella Jean\u2019s options are so elegantly chic, they\u2019ll carry you through \u2014 rain or shine.\n\nDouble helix\n\nDolce & Gabbana\u2019s epic DNA-themed show was a fusion of the brand\u2019s signature styles and muses, from past to present. The extravaganza featured more than 150 models, wearing everything from corset dresses to head-to-toe florals (quite literally: petals were affixed to strutters\u2019 skin). Famous faces headlined the f\u00eate: icons like Isabella Rossellini and Helena Christensen as well as Insta strutters Emily Ratajkowski, Ashley Graham and Cameron Dallas. Whether old guard or new \u2014 it\u2019s all in the famiglia.\n\nStitch a tent\n\nThe second installment of the Moncler Genius project didn\u2019t involve actual clothes. Instead, the five splashy designer collabs were digitally streamed in separate rooms. Our favorite? Craig Green\u2019s \u201ctent\u201d ensembles, which bounced and twirled in vibrant colors. It\u2019s a look you could live in.\n\nIn the clear\n\nMarco de Vincenzo drew inspiration from his childhood in Sicily and visits from his \u201cgarishly\u201d styled American aunt for his spring show \u2014 a mix of bold USA (cartoonish lamb prints and pastel denim) and traditional Italy (lace and giant crosses). Standouts were aquarium-like, rattan cases (above) filled with lemons, succulents and sparkly boots.",

  "url": "https://nypost.com/2018/10/09/looks-to-steal-from-londons-spring-2019-runways/",
  "text": "London fashion week is the industry\u2019s rebellious sibling: wild, spunky and delightfully unpredictable. From fantastical floral whimsy spun from embellished tulle to ladylike lace rethought with razor-sharp tailoring, the season delivered. Powdery blue emerged as a front-runner for spring, as did the trench. Nowhere did the latter shine more than at Riccardo Tisci\u2019s intensely anticipated debut at Burberry. His vision for the 162-year-old brand rang clear: traditional, but with a refreshing Tisci twist.\n\nFabulous florals\n\nBehold the blossoms designed to break the internet. From Molly Goddard\u2019s red-dress emoji-inspired ruffles to Matty Bovan\u2019s delightfully major gowns, even wallflowers will wilt for next spring\u2019s offerings. We\u2019re calling Mary Katrantzou\u2019s inflatable floral frocks the new poolside must.\n\nAnimal instincts\n\nScene stealers will pounce on Burberry\u2019s fierce head-to-toe mash-up and Ashley Williams\u2019 classic A-line look. For those more sartorially stealthy, JW Anderson\u2019s sleek, shoulder-baring number is proof that walking on the wild side will never go out of style.\n\nBaby blue\n\nThis pretty hue was everywhere, represented on a medley of silhouettes. From Roland Mouret\u2019s sporty, striped pants to Halpern\u2019s bow-topped frocks, the subtle shade made a surprisingly strong entrance (cue Erdem\u2019s sweeping, embellished ball gown).\n\nRacy lace\n\nDesigners edged up this often-saccharine fabric, inspiring us to live la vida lace come spring. Victoria Beckham\u2019s take riffed on men\u2019s shirting and patchwork, while Preen by Thornton Bregazzi dressed down sheer asymmetry with a classic flat sandal. At Christopher Kane, strips of sparkles sewn throughout simply dazzled.\n\nPolka palooza\n\nThis season connected the dots in the most extraordinary way. Breakout star Rejina Pyo saw spots on matching hats and skirts styled with eye-popping neon, while Richard Quinn whipped his up in larger-than-life bows. At Burberry, Riccardo Tisci paired polka dots with socks and pumps. Spot on.\n\nBrand new Burberry\n\nRiccardo Tisci\u2019s appointment as chief creative officer at Burberry was highly anticipated by the fashion crowd \u2014 and did not disappoint. The former Givenchy designer (who created both the gloved gown Kim Kardashian wore to her first Met Gala, as well as the dress she donned to wed Kanye West) made some flashy upgrades to the iconic British brand. Big changes among the 134 looks he sent down his debut runway included a new logo and a refresh of the label\u2019s iconic trench coat \u2014 now trimmed with gold chain links. And worn by Kendall Jenner, naturally.\n\nWord up\n\nBreakout designer Ashley Williams\u2019 sparkly catchphrase hairpins caught It girls\u2019 attention last season. (Selena Gomez was recently spotted wearing her \u201cUGLY\u201d barrette in NYC.) Williams revealed more hair-raising clips for spring, like \u201cTECHNO,\u201d \u201cCOSMIC\u201d \u201cWOMAN\u201d and \u201cVIRGIN.\u201d\n\nDesigner birthdays\n\nVictoria Beckham celebrated her label\u2019s 10th anniversary by showing her collection in London for the first time, with legendary model Stella Tennant opening the show. So iconic. So posh! Meanwhile, Jenny Packham rang in 30 years as a red-carpet go-to for A-listers like Angelina Jolie and Kate Middleton by moving her glamorous presentation from NYC back to London.",

  "text": "How do you know weed is firmly out of Cheech & Chong territory? When it\u2019s the subject of a serious \u201cLuxury Meets Cannabis\u201d conference at Manhattan\u2019s tony NeueHouse. \u201cThe folks in attendance were really engaged,\u201d panelist Andrew Goetz recalls of the June event. \u201cOr maybe they were just really stoned.\u201d\n\nThe Malin + Goetz co-founder is joking, of course. As a pioneer in the buzzy beauty category (his brand launched its scented \u201cCannabis\u201d candle in 2007), Goetz says he was honored to sit alongside fellow upscale, pot-inspired product purveyors. Those included Cindy Capobianco \u2014 co-founder of the celeb-darling cannabis line Lord Jones \u2014 and hemp savant Megan Villa, creative and content director for Svn Space, considered the Net-A-Porter of the weed world.\n\nNow that marijuana use has been decriminalized in nine states and the US Senate has voted to legalize hemp, it\u2019s open season for weed-themed products crafted from hemp seed oil (a great moisturizer) and CBD oil. (The cannabidiol compound from the hemp plant is said to confer therapeutic benefits.) Just don\u2019t expect to get high; those ingredients don\u2019t contain tetrahydrocannabinol (or THC), the chief \u201cpsychoactive\u201d element of marijuana.\n\nYour skin, however, may still experience euphoria. Both hemp and CBD oils have a reputation for improving complexions, from blotting up excess oil to softening lines and wrinkles. And dozens of products are vying to be the next, ahem, hit.\n\nCannabliss Organic offers a four-item skin care range that marries hemp oil with Korean herbs. Hora Skin Care Super Serum relies on vitamins and fatty acids alongside CBD to restore radiance. High Five Cannabis Facial Moisturizer and High Expectations Cannabis Facial Oil, meanwhile, contain heavy doses of cannabis sativa seed oil for repair and protection. And Milk Makeup is expanding its line of Kush eye-enhancers, which are laced with CBD oil for hydration, with two brow gels. (Memo to beauty nerds who don\u2019t get buzzed: \u201cKush\u201d is slang for pot.)\n\n\u201cCannabis [CBD] oil is hot right now, because it\u2019s new and becoming more widely accepted,\u201d says Milk Makeup co-founder Dianna Ruth. \u201cBut I think it will have staying power, and will turn into a classic oil, like argan or marula.\u201d\n\nStoked by the success of its CBD-spiked Pain & Wellness Body Lotion (everyone from Jessica Seinfeld and Busy Philipps to Sarah Paulson sings its praises), Lord Jones is cooking up an anti-aging brew and \u201ca super-nourishing face oil.\u201d\n\nBut does CBD, arguably the most popular of the stoner ingredients, really do anything for the skin? \u201cIt\u2019s been proven to be helpful with inflammation and pain,\u201d says skin doc Shereene Idriss, of Union Square Dermatology. \u201cIt can also help reduce oil production, and it\u2019s been shown to have some anti-oxidant effect.\u201d\n\nHydrated brows and lashes? Fewer lines and wrinkles? Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Or, rather, slather it on.",

  "url": "https://nypost.com/2018/10/09/jenny-slate-talks-sexual-angst-and-her-feminist-wake-up-call/",
  "text": "Jenny Slate may be a stunner in Old Hollywood glam for our cover shoot, but make no mistake: This is a woman deeply, joyfully in touch with her inner gawky teen.\n\nAs the braces-encumbered Missy on Netflix\u2019s raunchy animated series \u201cBig Mouth,\u201d Slate embarked on a sweet, if spitty, relationship with John Mulaney\u2019s character last year, and she\u2019s back for more in the new season (released last week).\n\n\u201cRecording \u2018Big Mouth\u2019 makes me feel such tenderness for my teen self,\u201d says the petite comedian and actress, feet tucked up on her couch with the head of her elderly bichon fris\u00e9, Reggie, in her lap. The Massachusetts native was \u201ca pretty close sister to Missy,\u201d she says. \u201cMy diary from being 13 years old is filled with what boys I liked and \u2018Why haven\u2019t I hit puberty?\u2019 \u2014 which was years away. I was a teeny, tiny gal for so long!\u201d\n\nNow 36, Slate sings the praises of adulthood \u2014 \u201cI can look down at my sweet little boobs and be like, \u2018Yeah, I made it!\u2019\u201d \u2014 but she\u2019s still transitioning: in her film roles, her personal life and even her real estate. She recently moved out of a rental in LA\u2019s Silver Lake neighborhood and bought the nearby Craftsman house where we\u2019re currently noshing on Slate\u2019s fresh-baked brownies and berry seltzer.\n\nThe actress has been working so consistently since that purchase (shooting the Marvel movie \u201cVenom,\u201d out now, and a lead role in an upcoming Scandinavian drama), she hasn\u2019t had time to really settle in. \u201cI didn\u2019t change anything except the wallpaper,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the bathroom. Which looked like what a single man would think a spa looks like. Or a hotel where they have a lot of conferences, but they know people want their butts warmed.\u201d\n\nIn August, she was back in New York, the city where she got a degree in English and comparative lit from Columbia, then ran a comedy night for years in Williamsburg with fellow comics Gabe Liedman and Max Silvestri. This time, she arrived with a bit more celebrity heft, as host of a splashy 25th anniversary bash for the feminist magazine Bust. Even for a seasoned stand-up like Slate (check out her critically acclaimed 2014 film \u201cObvious Child\u201d for a sampling), this was a daunting gig. Some badass ladies were in that room: Erykah Badu, Eve Ensler, and Phoebe Robinson of \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was really nervous,\u201d Slate says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Is my material wise enough? Is it progressive enough?\u2019\u201d But when she took the stage, she killed, especially when delving back into that bottomless well of teen melodrama.\n\n\u201cI always feel excited and happy when I talk about the constant but unusable horniness I felt as a teenager,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that was because when I was 15, I looked like an 11-year-old. I had the horniness of a 45-year-old, very sexually experienced woman. But nobody wanted in, because it didn\u2019t line up with what I looked like.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people relate to that,\u201d she continues. \u201cEverybody at one time or another has had a s \u2013 \u2013 t-ton of horniness and no way to change it from potential energy to kinetic!\u201d\n\nWhile Slate recently told Elle that she\u2019s \u201cready to fall in love again,\u201d she insists to Alexa that she\u2019s not rushing into another long-term relationship any time soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how to be in the world as a woman, without being a woman who\u2019s attached to a man,\u201d she says. Known in recent years for an on-again, off-again relationship with Captain America heartthrob and Twitter mensch Chris Evans, she\u2019s diving into the relatively uncharted waters of singledom.\n\nBefore Evans, she was married from 2012 to 2016 to filmmaker Dean Fleischer-Camp, with whom she created the buzzy stop-motion short \u201cMarcel the Shell with Shoes On\u201d and its two sequels; the pair are currently collaborating on a feature-film version of that quirky world. Their relationship, now platonic, remains solid: \u201cDean, creatively, is really unlike anyone else I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d she says.\n\nThe first \u201cMarcel,\u201d in 2010, was one of Slate\u2019s first big forays into voice work; since then, she\u2019s played parts in blockbuster animated films like \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets,\u201d \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie,\u201d alongside edgier cult cartoons like \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d and \u201cAdventure Time.\u201d Her success in this realm is no surprise. She\u2019s got a voice that\u2019s both adorably squeaky and downright husky, kind of an aural approximation of her dichotomous 15-year-old self.\n\nWhen she\u2019s not working, Slate relishes the pleasures, small and large, of living alone. \u201cThe way I am when I eat ramen by myself, I should be in a barn or a stall,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a real splatterfest.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m trying to figure out how to be in the world as a woman, without being a woman who\u2019s attached to a man.\u2019\n\nShe also just lopped off her long hair. \u201cI felt like I had been gearing myself toward straight males. Like, I only had long hair because I thought it was better for auditions, or I thought that\u2019s what guys liked. Then I was like, \u2018This is stupid! I don\u2019t want to work for someone that unimaginative. I don\u2019t want to date someone who just wants long hair.\u2019 And I\u2019ve gotta say, this is one of the best haircuts I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nOn a deeper level, she\u2019s mulling over notions of identity and feminism, incorporating them into a book she\u2019s writing. \u201cI had been unconsciously discouraged from using the word \u2018feminist\u2019 for a large portion of my formative years,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a teenager in the \u201990s. And somewhere in the zeitgeist was the word \u2018feminazi.\u2019 Now, I\u2019m so focused on pulling out the roots of misogyny from my life. Because I think it\u2019s in all of us. I think it\u2019s deeply woven in, and you have to be super vigilant about it.\u201d\n\nShe, thankfully, doesn\u2019t have any first-person horror stories about sexual harassment. But she\u2019s been reflecting on everyday sexism and her response to it. \u201cIt\u2019s great to get out there and be like, \u2018I\u2019m a badass, and I don\u2019t take s \u2013 \u2013 t from anyone!\u2019 But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m like. I DO take a lot of s \u2013 \u2013 t. But then I right those wrongs in a way that works for me.\u201d\n\nSlate often finds that catharsis onstage. \u201cA weird stereotype about comedians is that they\u2019re really depressive,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, I think I do comedy because my inner world is begging to be let out into the external one.\u201d\n\nActing in a comic-book movie also syncs up with her mission to right wrongs. She\u2019s not the lead in \u201cVenom\u201d \u2014 that would be Tom Hardy, the titular, journalist antihero \u2014 and she won\u2019t say much about her role in advance, per the tight-lipped Marvel p.r. playbook. But here is what she\u2019ll share:\n\n\u201cI play a scientist,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not a stereotypical female character, because her role was originally written for a man. \u201cI\u2019m not a romantic interest,\u201d Slate explains, then bursts out laughing. \u201cThat sounded like I said that definitively. Like, in the [real] world.\u201d\n\nThe jury\u2019s still out on whether she will make it through a screening of the film. \u201cI\u2019m a scaredy-cat, and Venom is a really extreme character.\u201d\n\nSlate found a surprising remedy for her fears while shooting her next film, \u201cThe Sunlit Night,\u201d in Arctic Norway. \u201cThe sun never set. It made me feel awesome, because I tend to sleep with the light on.\u201d She plays an American visual artist apprenticing with a housepainter, under German director David Wnendt, who helmed the gloriously profane, riot-grrrl-toned indie \u201cWetlands.\u201d Slate\u2019s a producer on this film, too \u2014 another first.\n\nNow that she\u2019s back in LA, the SNL alum would like to do more stand-up, but there will be new material to develop. \u201cUsually after I\u2019ve done a film, it means I\u2019ve changed, and a lot of the things I wanted to talk about, I\u2019m not interested in anymore.\u201d (Although she vows the act will always include a fart joke or two; some things remain timelessly funny.)\n\nWhatever the new act contains, you can bet Slate will incorporate her newly raised consciousness. \u201cSomething has recalibrated in me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so f \u2013 \u2013 king relieved.\u201d\n\nFashion Editor: Serena French; Stylist: Anahita Moussavian; Hair: Nikki; Providence at Forward Artists using R+Co; Makeup: Kirin Bhatty at Starworks; Artists using Kosas; Manicure: Jolene Brodeur at TACK Artist Group.\n\nOur cover shoot was photographed on location at the Villa Carlotta, a Hollywood landmark that was built in 1926 and recently renovated by CGI Strategies into glamorous, new residences. The Spanish-Colonial-style icon \u2014 once favored by the likes of Jim Morrison and Marion Davies \u2014 is nestled at 5959 Franklin Ave., near the base of Beachwood Canyon in Los Angeles. Its foyer features elaborately stenciled wood beams, arched corridors and a grand piano, while a palm-filled courtyard and sprawling roof deck offer al fresco delights (including a view of the Hollywood sign). Ranging from studios to two-bedrooms, residences at the Villa Carlotta \u2014 where luxe hotel amenities include housekeeping, dog walking, in-home dining and a 24-hour concierge \u2014 can be leased for stays of 30 days or longer via The Agency\u2019s Billy Rose: brose@theagencyre.com. \u2014 Carrie Seim",

  "url": "https://nypost.com/2018/10/09/was-this-the-most-fabulous-paris-spring-fashion-week-ever/",
  "text": "I was on hand (@anahitaglitters) for the beaucoup wow moments of the season: Gucci\u2019s Parisian takeover! Hedi Slimane\u2019s debut at Celine! Saint Laurent\u2019s walk-on-water models! Chanel\u2019s indoor beach! The venues were far-flung \u2014 metaphorically and literally \u2014 leaving little room for Champagne (though it was served at Celine in branded mini bottles).\n\nIn between the grandeur were pockets of sartorial paradise. From Manish Arora\u2019s \u201cGirls Just Wanna Have Fun\u201d-themed collection to John Galliano\u2019s prairie-dress parade, wardrobe wanderlust was in full swing.\n\nFeather weather\n\nTake flight in the season\u2019s most delightful trim. Gucci\u2019s girl goes magpie in neon, while Valentino and Loewe cuff their frocks with major plumage. Dramatic skirts (and handbags) lead the flock at Rochas, while Dries van Noten\u2019s muse wears feathers in her hair.\n\nTinker tailor\n\nRazor-sharp shapes sliced through Paris\u2019 edgiest runways. Balenciaga toyed with ruching, tucked seamlessly into V-shaped waistbands. Givenchy\u2019s precisely shaped jackets had a starring role sans shirting. Meanwhile, breakout star Marine Serre showed skirt suits that hit all the right angles.\n\nTake a bow\n\nSpring\u2019s sweetest sleeper hit is fit to be tied. Whether finished in satin draped elegantly atop denim dresses at Miu Miu, cinched at the waist at Manish Arora, or styled asymmetrically on top of mismatched suiting at Maison Margiela, designers tied \u2019em on.\n\nTulle of the trade\n\nAt Dior, models sashayed down the runway in ballet-pink skirts styled with matching, ribbon-trimmed slippers. Off-White\u2019s athleisure fanatic wears her tutu with the season\u2019s It sneaker, while at Thom Browne, a whispering tuft of tulle contrasts with outrageously tailored straitjackets.\n\nBathing beauties\n\nDesigners had beach on the brain, led by Chanel\u2019s postcard-perfect set complete with sand, roaring waves and a tr\u00e9s chic, one-shouldered maillot paired with denim. At Saint Laurent\u2019s palm-tree paradise, a finale of animal-print pieces walked on water, while Jacquemus\u2019 glamour girl was decked out in jewels and the most major handbag.\n\nEye spy at Valentino\n\nMakeup legend Pat McGrath put her fantastical touch on Valentino\u2019s impeccable show. Models\u2019 eyes were surrounded by dazzling Swarovski crystals in vibrant shades of violet and lime green (to match the color palette of the collection). With strutters\u2019 faces made up like superheroes in couture-inspired pieces, it\u2019s no wonder the finale received a standing ovation.\n\nVuitton\u2019s click-bait\n\nLatch on to Louis Vuitton\u2019s new take on its popular Petite Malle handbag. Patched together like a Rubik\u2019s Cube and topped with a handle, this citrus-hued beauty (above) is destined for street-style stardom. For label lovers, the brands\u2019 logo-stamped spaceship bags are also ready for takeoff.\n\nHedi\u2019s new Celine\n\nHedi Slimane unveiled his first collection for Celine (n\u00e9e C\u00e9line), ditching the accent, as well as Phoebe Philo\u2019s minimalist aesthetic. He riffed on his signatures: tailored suits and embellished party frocks with an \u201980s twist. Those mourning the Philo era can scroll new Insta account @OldC\u00e9line, dedicated to his predecessor.",

  "text": "Facebook is rolling out its first-ever tech gadget \u2014 and it\u2019s every bit as creepy as you\u2019d expect.\n\nThe social-networking giant on Monday unveiled a new line of voice-activated home speakers with screens that enable video chats with friends and family \u2014 but critics said they sound more like Big Brother spy devices.\n\nIn addition to collecting data on users\u2019 commands with Alexa-powered artificial intelligence software, the Portal and Portal+ speakers are equipped with cameras that can follow users around a room and enhance the sound of their voices when they talk.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s like \u2026 look at this cool new gadget that eavesdrops on you and does creepy stuff with the info it collects,\u2019\u201d tweeted Ido Kolovaty, a professor at the University of Tulsa College of Law.\n\nIndeed, CEO Mark Zuckerberg this spring reportedly pushed back the Portal\u2019s launch date by nearly half a year after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal blew up.\n\nAnticipating the privacy concerns, Facebook said Monday it is equipping the Portals with a cover to block the camera lens when users want privacy.\n\nUsers can likewise deactivate the microphone by pressing a button on the device \u2014 although critics noted that it\u2019s not clear if there\u2019s a way to turn it off with a voice command.\n\nIn a Monday blog post, Facebook noted that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t listen to, view, or keep the contents of your Portal video calls.\u201d\n\nThe social network added that Portal\u2019s camera \u201cdoesn\u2019t use facial recognition and doesn\u2019t identify who you are,\u201d and that \u201cYou can delete your Portal\u2019s voice history in your Facebook Activity Log at any time.\u201d\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop a slew of skepticism engulfing the launch on Monday.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, please record and analyze the way I move, what I eat, what I listen to, how many guests are in my home, how many of my guests are Facebook friends,\u201d Twitter user Eric J. Schulze sarcastically tweeted.\n\nThe products are landing after a year of scandals over the company\u2019s handling of private data that has sent shares down nearly 25 percent from their peak.\n\nLast month, the company experienced its biggest known hack when 50 million users\u2019 profiles \u2014 and possibly millions more accounts that use Facebook logins \u2014 were compromised.",

Stern. \u201cWe understand a crafted, strategic visual is the most powerful marketing tool,\u201d Bannister tells Alexa. \u201cYou are guaranteed this at DBOX.\u201d\n\nRising: Rebuilding Ground Zero \u2013 DBOX from DBOX on Vimeo.\n\n\u2014 H.M.\n\nSAIF SUMAIDA, 46, and AMIT KHURANA, 37\n\nFor New York-based developers Sumaida and Khurana, a rising building should serve a far greater purpose than mere shelter.\n\nTheir 3-year-old company focuses on delivering dazzling additions to the city skyline \u2014 specifically, inaugural NYC projects from leading world architects.\n\nOne of them, Japan\u2019s Pritzker Prize-winner Tadao Ando\u2019s 152 Elizabeth Street condominium \u2014 adorned with glass, concrete and burnished-metal touches \u2014 launched sales this month with prices from $5.75 million.\n\nThe pair is also working with Portugal\u2019s \u00c1lvaro Siza, another Pritzker recipient, and development firm LENY to bring 611 West 56th Street, a 35-story residential tower, to Midtown by 2018.\n\n\u201cThe essence of New York is based in cultural diversity and collaboration,\u201d Khurana tells Alexa. \u201cThere is something quite special about bringing master architects known for the purity and refinement of their design.\u201d\n\n152 Elizabeth \u2013 Tadao Ando (full length) from Noe Associates on Vimeo.\n\n\u2014 Z.K.\n\nSOO K. CHAN, 53\n\nFounding principal and design director, SCDA Architects\n\nThe rare high-profile architect who\u2019s also a developer \u2014 as well as landscape, interior and product designer \u2014 the Singapore-born, Yale-educated Chan works around the world, building a resort in Bali, creating an installation for the Venice Biennale, teaching at Syracuse and designing a luxury residential tower in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHe\u2019s won awards from the likes of the Royal Institute of British Architects and had his work published in such illustrious outlets as Architectural Record and the Architectural Review.\n\nNow, as he tells Alexa, he\u2019s \u201cbringing a contemporary Asian sensibility to design in New York,\u201d making his US debut with West 29th Street\u2019s Soori High Line, where 16 of the 31 units have private pools. \u201c\n\nIt will be my vision fully realized,\u201d Chan says of this building, which he\u2019s both designing and co-developing. He\u2019s also got 29th Street\u2019s 12-unit 515 Highline under way, too, as well as a 38-story residence tower at 118 East 59th Street.\n\n\u2014 A.S.\n\nANNABELLE SELLDORF, 54\n\nCelebrated for the impeccable precision of her designs, Selldorf has become the go-to architect for bijou, in-the-know cultural institutions, from the UES\u2019s Neue Galerie, carved out of an early-20th century Fifth Avenue mansion, to Hauser & Wirth\u2019s gallery in Chelsea\u2019s former Roxy nightclub.\n\nShe\u2019s also designed the exteriors and interiors of prominent luxe residential buildings, including Noho\u2019s soon-to-finish 10 Bond Street, which contains just 11 loftlike units.\n\nUpcoming projects include 42 Crosby Street and 548 West 22nd Street, where she will add a 19-story tower to the existing four-floor structure.\n\nThese buildings \u201cmake a real contribution to the urban fabric,\u201d Selldorf tells Alexa. \u201cThey shape the streetscape and neighborhood and are as much for the people who experience them from the outside as the residents on the inside.\u201d\n\n\u2014 A.S\n\nVERONICA MAINETTI, 36\n\nVeronica Mainetti stands out not only for being a successful female developer in a male-dominated industry but also for pushing the boundaries of green-friendly luxury real estate development.\n\nHer 60 White Street condominium conversion in Tribeca, where prices now start at $4.58 million, incorporates a high-insulation envelope to deter hot and cold air; local-sourced wood and marble; and \u2014 as testament to her dedication \u2014 the elimination of volatile organic compounds, which are extremely common chemicals in building materials.\n\n\u201cIn luxury building, sustainability and energy efficiency should be the norm because they\u2019re very achievable,\u201d the Italy-born Mainetti tells Alexa. \u201cThe more people literally buy into this philosophy, the more inexpensive it is going to become to practice it.\u201d\n\nHer company Sorgente, which has an emphasis on historical preservation projects, also developed 34 Greene Street in NYC and owns the fully occupied Fine Arts and Clock Tower commercial buildings in LA. She hopes to bring a 60 White-style eco building to California in the near future.\n\n\u2014 Z.K.\n\nROBERT REFFKIN, 35\n\nFounder and CEO, Compass\n\nCurious that a former White House Fellow and private-equities man would turn to real estate sales for his second (and still very early) chapter, but so it went for Reffkin, who, along with co-founder Ori Allon, understood that big data can help sellers and buyers settle on the right price.\n\nCompass\u2019 algorithms allow its 400 agents to figure out what month they should list a particular property, what might happen if they list a price 20 percent too high, and why 6 percent is a reasonable commission.\n\nSince officially launching in 2014 \u2014 and hiring a secret weapon, broker Leonard Steinberg \u2014 Compass has gone from $0 to nearly $1 billion in listings.\n\nBig names who chose Reffkin\u2019s team over more seasoned brokerage firms include the $750 million 100 East 53rd Street; 152 Elizabeth, designed by Tadao Ando; and a coveted listing at 740 Park Avenue. \u201cIf you believe that 99 percent of buyers are coming from co-brokers or an aggregator, then the role of the brokerage firm is to provide the best platform for agents to run their business,\u201d says Reffkin.\n\n\u2014 H.M.\n\nJAMIE DRAKE, 58\n\nThe interior designer who famously decorated Madonna\u2019s LA home and completed a restoration of Gracie Mansion for Mayor Bloomberg in 2002 (\u201cThe research and study necessary for that kind of job?\n\nCompletely new and different for me, but I loved it,\u201d he tells Alexa) is known for his take on exuberant interiors, with whimsical flourishes and a luxurious sense of textural layering.\n\nWith nearly 40 years in business, his firm is now handling several residential projects, including a full floor of apartments at Herzog and de Meuron\u2019s modernist Tribeca building 56 Leonard and homes at the 90-story behemoth One57.\n\n\u2014 J.C.\n\nBJARKE INGELS, 40\n\nStill something of a wunderkind even as his firm, Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), approaches its 10th anniversary, the Danish Ingels is famous for bold, unapologetic designs that almost strain credulity, including his multistory living complex Mountain Dwellings in Copenhagen and the spiraling Denmark Pavilion that debuted at EXPO 2010 in Shanghai.\n\nNow the architect, who moved to New York in 2012, is putting his stamp on Gotham via a residential building on West 57th Street known as W57, which resembles a giant pyramid with a cutout courtyard in the center.\n\nIngels has also replaced Norman Foster as designer of the second tower at the World Trade Center site \u2014 Two World Trade Center \u2014 with a plan for a seven-tiered building.\n\nIn other high-profile news, Ingels is also working as co-designer of the new Google headquarters in California.\n\nW57 \u2013 West 57th Residential Building from BIG on Vimeo.\n\n\u2014 J.C.\n\nROBERT A. M. STERN, 76\n\nFounder and senior partner, Robert A.M. Stern Architects\n\nThe architectural firm that bears his name altered the fabric of New York real estate back in 2000, when Stern turned his eye from individual houses to larger, multifamily commissions.\n\nThe architect designed the Chatham, at 181 E. 65th St. (where he also resides), for the Related Companies; its limestone-and-brick Georgian facade added zeroes to the price of living on the UES, and made his addresses shorthand for inhabitants with grand yet unpretentious style.\n\nWhile 15 Central Park West remains his most iconic project to date, the dean of the Yale School of Architecture (yes, he also makes time to run an Ivy League school) has more tricks up his sleeve: Watch for the openings of future icons 520 Park Avenue, 20 East End Avenue and the Four Seasons Private Residences Downtown, at 30 Park Place, in the next two years.\n\n\u2014 H.M.\n\nMICHAEL SHVO, 42\n\nPresident and CEO, SHVO\n\nPerhaps as famous for his bold personality as his real-estate acumen, Israel-born Shvo launched his firm SHVO in 2004, developing properties that include Bryant Park Tower, the ultra-luxe Amangiri resort in Utah and the Armani Casa-outfitted 20 Pine residences in the Financial District.\n\nAfter retiring from real estate to pursue his passion for art in 2008, Shvo returned in 2013 by purchasing the Getty Oil gas station in West Chelsea for $23.5 million.\n\nA master showman (and marketer), Shvo then filled the space with sculptural Lalanne sheep, turning it into a public-art installation (an eight-unit project from architect Peter Marino is planned for the site).\n\nThe tastemaking Shvo now has $3.5 billion worth under development, including the recently acquired Crown building (with Russian developer Vladislav Doronin), the skyscraper at 125 Greenwich St., the residential tower at 100 Varick by starchitect Renzo Piano, and a private island (of course) resort in the Bahamas.\n\n\u2014 J.C.\n\nZIEL FELDMAN, 56\n\nFounder and chairman of HFZ Capital Group\n\nFew New Yorkers had heard of HFZ until the money man and his partners started buying up distressed assets \u2014 like One Madison\u2014 during the market downturn.\n\nNow the former Property Markets Group partner is firmly in the black (to the tune of $7.5 billion in transactions) and investing in some serious real estate risks.\n\nThe secret sauce? Diversification.\n\n\u201cHFZ\u2019s strategy of creating different types of product at varying price points in often unexpected or emerging locations, along with its collaboration with noted architects, has helped put the company in its enviable position,\u201d says founder and Chairman Ziel Feldman.\n\nHFZ recently began aggressively investing in historic conversions, like 11 Beach Street, as well as ground-up construction projects (see 505 West 19th Street) that might seem like pie-in-the-sky dreams to others. Their 76 11th Avenue condo project, for example, is currently a parking lot on the High Line that\u2019s a no-go zone of leftovers from the night before.\n\nHFZ paid a whopping $870 million for the two-city-block space, over which Bjarke Ingels\u2019 two towers will rise \u2014 along with West Chelsea prices. Word is the two- to three-bedroom condominiums will trade for nearly $4,000 a square foot.\n\n\u2014 H.M.\n\nABY ROSEN, 55\n\nCo-founder and principal, RFR Holding\n\nAn owner of the midcentury-modern Midtown icons Lever House and the Seagram Building \u2014 where he\u2019s planning changes for its restaurant, the Four Seasons \u2014 the German-born Rosen also throws his weight around as a collector of contemporary art, chair of the New York State Council on the Arts and a trustee of the New Museum.\n\nHis ownership stake in NYC\u2019s Gramercy Park and Paramount hotels, as well as Miami\u2019s W South Beach, makes him a player in the world of hospitality, too.\n\nHis residential-real estate prowess, meanwhile, extends across 2,200 units in 50 metropolitan-area properties, including One Jackson Square, the Herzog & de Meuron-designed 40 Bond Street and the forthcoming One Hundred East Fifty Third Street, an ultra-luxe spot masterminded by Norman Foster, where sales start soon.\n\n\u2014 A.S.\n\nJONATHAN MILLER, 54\n\nPresident and CEO, Miller Samuel Inc.\n\nMiller\u2019s 29-year-old firm is the leading real estate-appraisal consultancy in New York \u2014 if not America. Tasked with determining how much real estate is actually worth, his team can literally raise (or lower) the price bar on developments and even districts.\n\nWhen not evaluating costly homes and condos, he develops highly detailed \u201cstate-of-the-market\u201d reports covering South Florida, Los Angeles, Aspen and NYC for Douglas Elliman. And his prescient 2012 declaration that \u201cluxury real estate is the new global currency\u201d was repeated as gospel by real estate insiders across the globe.\n\nWhile he certainly sits on a powerful perch, Miller views himself as a steward of transparency and accountability in an industry often fraught with half-truths and broker babble. \u201cOur industry is full of a tremendous amount of hyperbole, which is not often to the benefit of the consumer,\u201d he tells Alexa. \u201cIt\u2019s important to provide a neutral benchmark so that people can make effective decisions.\u201d\n\n\u2014 D.K.\n\nROMAN ABRAMOVICH, 48\n\nInvestor/developer\n\nRussia\u2019s 12th richest man \u2014 whom Forbes estimates is worth $9.3 billion \u2014 Abramovich began his colonization of London\u2019s exclusive Lowndes Square a decade ago, buying up nine flats at a cost of about $230 million.\n\nNow, the Moscow-based Abramovich has set his sights on Manhattan, with a similarly ambitious luxury real estate blueprint. In January, news broke that he bought three adjacent townhouses on East 75th Street with plans to turn them into a single megamansion \u2014 for a total price tag somewhere between $55 million and $70 million.\n\n(He may have started a trend: Earlier this month, three adjacent townhouses on East 62ndStreet were also listed together by an unknown owner for $120 million, with similar plans to combine them into a single, 30,000-square-foot megahome.)\n\nDon\u2019t expect Abramovich, who first built his fortune in the early 1990s via a series of oil export deals, to slow down his Gotham expansion. \u201cIf I had to think where I could live if not Moscow,\u201d he once told the Guardian, \u201cLondon would be my first choice, and second would be New York.\u201d\n\n\u2014 D.C.\n\nTHOMAS JUUL-HANSEN, 45\n\nThe Harvard-educated Dane, who immigrated to the US in 1988, is certainly living the American Dream.\n\nAfter a stint at Richard Meier & Partners, he broke off on his own in 2003, and quickly diversified his portfolio into restaurants, private houses, retail, and large-scale residential buildings. Handling the entire interiors package at One57 certainly put his firm on the radar; its subtle design gives off a discreet vibe of tranquility, simplicity and high customization.\n\nJuul-Hansen has never worked with a press attach\u00e9; word of mouth is how developers find out about the wunderkind behind 505 West 19th on the High Line and 210 West 77th Street uptown \u2014 you might not know it\u2019s a Thomas Juul-Hansen design, but you\u2019ll know.\n\n\u201cOur design intention is always to make spaces that are clean and simple and serene, but warm and rich at the same time,\u201d he tells Alexa. \u201cThis is amplified by using natural materials, which also helps the longevity of our work.\u201d\n\n\u2014 H.M.\n\nANDRE KIKOSKI, 48\n\nAn alum of architecture firm Pei Cobb Freed (formerly I.M. Pei & Partners), Kikoski made his name in the early aughts with Suba, one of the first restaurants to make the Lower East Side a dining destination, thanks to his ingenious cantilevered dining platform surrounded by a moat of water.\n\nSince then, Kikoski\u2019s innovative designs (often at a grand scale with expert applications of negative space) have been seen at the Wright at the Guggenheim Museum (which won a James Beard Award for outstanding restaurant design), various Saks Fifth Avenue department stores nationwide and the warehouse exterior of Wyckoff Exchange in Bushwick.\n\nNow, the architect is at work on several hush-hush downtown projects, including a condo building in Nolita, the interiors of a luxury building in Hudson Yards and a warehouse conversion in Tribeca.\n\n\u2014 J.C.\n\nTOP PHOTO: Clockwise from top left, Sorgente Group of America president Veronica Mainetti; Compass CEO and former White House fellow Robert Reffkin; SCDA Architects founder Soo K.

  "text": "Selena Gomez is in treatment for mental health issues after being hospitalized twice in the last two weeks, TMZ reports.\n\nThe former Disney starlet, who underwent a kidney transplant in September 2017, was at her Studio City, Calif., home two weeks ago when sources tell the site she became \u201cdespondent and emotional\u201d over a low white blood cell count, leading a family member to transport her to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nGomez, 26, returned home days later, but was readmitted the following week because her white blood cell count didn\u2019t improve, which reportedly sent her spiraling.\n\nSources claim Gomez demanded to be released from the hospital and had an \u201cemotional breakdown,\u201d even attempting to rip her IVs from her arm.\n\nThe \u201cWolves\u201d singer, who suffers from the autoimmune disease lupus, currently is being treated in an East Coast psychiatric facility.\n\nInsiders revealed to People that Gomez had a \u201ctough few weeks\u201d and suffered a panic attack in the hospital.\n\nGomez reportedly is undergoing dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).\n\nOriginally developed for treatment of borderline personality disorder, DBT is a method often used to help treat several personality disorders and mental illnesses, including depression, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse, according to Psychology Today.\n\nDBT focuses on teaching patients mindfulness, healthy communication and behavioral patterns, emotional regulation and how to better respond to negative events.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the troubled singer, who announced a social media sabbatical in late September, has sought help.\n\nIn February 2018, Gomez completed two weeks in rehab for depression and anxiety, marking her third time in treatment for her issues, after which sources told Page Six she was avoiding alcohol.\n\nHer sobriety wasn\u2019t permanent, however: She revealed in the October issue of Elle, \u201cAs far as my personal life, someone sees me having a glass of wine?

  "text": "The remnants of Hurricane Michael \u2014 the most powerful storm on record to strike Florida\u2019s Panhandle \u2014 swept through Georgia on Thursday on a path toward the Carolinas after leaving widespread destruction and at least two deaths in its wake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to convey in words the scale of the catastrophe in Panama City. The whole city looks like a nuke was dropped on it. I\u2019m literally shocked at the scale of the destruction,\u201d storm chaser Josh Morgerman tweeted Wednesday night.\n\nAnother storm chaser echoed Morgerman\u2019s stark assessment.\n\n\u201cDrove from Panama City almost to Mexico Beach and I can tell you this is the worst damage from wind that I have ever seen! Absolutely catastrophic! You will not believe your eyes when you see it,\u201d Mark Sudduth tweeted.\n\n\u201cWalking thru Mexico Beach to receive my GoPro cam and I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s DEVASTATED. Truly devastated. Some buildings completely swept clean \u2013 only slabs,\u201d he added.\n\nA day after making landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida, as a Category 4 monster packing 155-mph winds, Tropical Storm Michael continued to weaken but was still threatening the Southeast with heavy rains, heavy winds and possible spinoff tornadoes.\n\nAuthorities said at least two people have died, a man killed by a tree falling on a Panhandle home and an 11-year-old girl killed by a tree falling on a home in southwest Georgia.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said early Thursday that the eye of Michael was about 90 miles northeast of Macon, Georgia, and about 45 miles west of Augusta.\n\nThe storm\u2019s maximum sustained winds have decreased to 50 mph and it was moving to the northeast at 21 mph. The core of Michael will move across eastern Georgia into central South Carolina later Thursday.\n\nAfter daylight Thursday, Florida residents took stock of the epic scale of the disaster.\n\nIn Panama City, near where Michael came ashore, uprooted trees and downed power lines were strewn everywhere and countless homes were torn asunder. More than 380,000 homes and businesses lost power at the height of the storm.\n\nVance Beu, 29, was staying with his mother at her home in a complex of single-story wood-frame buildings where they piled up mattresses around themselves for protection.\n\nA pine tree broke a hole in their roof and his ears popped when the barometric pressure plummeted. The roar of the winds, he said, sounded like a jet engine.\n\n\u201cIt was terrifying, honestly. There was a lot of noise. We thought the windows were going to break at any time,\u201d Beu said.\n\nSally Crown rode out Michael on the Panhandle, thinking at first that the worst damage was the many fallen trees in her yard before she emerged to check on the cafe she manages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely horrendous. Catastrophic,\u201d Crown said about the scene of devastation. \u201cThere\u2019s flooding. Boats on the highway. A house on the highway. Houses that have been there forever are just shattered.\u201d\n\nGen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, said some Florida residents may have been taken by surprise by the rapid escalation of the storm.\n\n\u201cIt really started as a tropical storm, and then it went to Category 1, then it was Category 2 and before you know it, it was Category 4,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy told Reuters.\n\nWith Post wires",

  "url": "https://nypost.com/2018/10/11/woman-who-spent-21m-on-luxury-goods-must-explain-to-court-where-money-came-from/",
  "text": "LONDON \u2014 A woman from Azerbaijan who spent 16 million pounds ($21 million) on jewelry, wine and other goods at luxury London department store Harrods over the course of a decade has become the first target of a new British rule allowing officials to seize money from people suspected of getting their wealth through corruption.\n\nA court has ordered Zamira Hajiyeva, 55, to explain where she got the money to also buy an 11.5 million pound ($15 million) London home close to Harrods and a golf course outside the city worth 10.5 million pounds ($14 million).\n\nHajiyeva\u2019s husband, former International Bank of Azerbaijan chairman Jahangir Hajiyev, was sentenced to 15 years in jail in his home country in 2016 for fraud and embezzlement.\n\nThe case marks Britain\u2019s first use of Unexplained Wealth Orders, introduced this year to curb London\u2019s status as a haven for ill-gotten gains. The orders allow authorities to seize assets over 50,000 pounds ($66,000) from people suspected of corruption or links to organized crime until the owners account for how they were acquired.\n\nDuring previous court hearings Hajiyeva was identified only as Mrs. A, but a court order granting her anonymity was lifted Wednesday.\n\nAt an earlier court hearing, a lawyer for Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency gave details of her spending at Harrods, a large chunk of it using 35 credit cards issued by her husband\u2019s bank. Between 2006 and 2016, Hajiyeva spent more than 16 million pounds at the store, including 100,000 pounds in one day on Cartier jewelry, 150,000 pounds in another trip on goods from luxury brand Boucheron, and 1,800 pounds on wine.\n\nThe crime agency argued the lavish spending was a sign the money was ill-gotten.\n\nHajiyeva denies wrongdoing and is fighting to overturn the order and hang onto her properties.\n\nHer lawyers said in a statement that the issuing of a wealth order \u201cdoes not and should not be taken to imply any wrong-doing, whether on her part or that of her husband.\u201d\n\nThey said the order \u201cis part of an investigative process, not a criminal procedure, and it does not involve the finding of any criminal offense.\u201d",

  "title": "Why couples should watch more porn",
  "url": "https://nypost.com/2018/10/10/watching-porn-together-is-the-new-couples-therapy/",
  "text": "Engaged couple Carly and Andrew were never the types to stash their sexy magazines under the mattress.\n\nInstead, the polyamorous Bronx couple, who declined to share their last names for privacy reasons, celebrated their shared love of porn from the get-go \u2014 basically from their first date, five years ago.\n\n\u201cWe bonded over me knowing [of] lots of porn stars and him knowing [of] lots of porn stars,\u201d Carly, 31, manager of the West Village sex-toy shop Pleasure Chest, tells The Post. Today, she and Andrew, a 26-year-old construction worker, love to crawl into bed and watch the X-rated flicks together. As Carly puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s like being at an orgy without having to talk to other people.\u201d\n\nThey also watch porn without each other: What with \u201cscheduling differences, libido differences [and] different stuff we\u2019re into,\u201d sometimes it\u2019s nice to unwind with a little me-time, Andrew says. The duo\u2019s even started filming their own amateur porn videos.\n\nCouples like Carly and Andrew are living proof of a point some sex activists have pushed for years: that happy couples can watch porn \u2014 and, in fact, benefit from it.\n\nThat\u2019s good news, considering how many people love erotica. In 2017, a Gallup poll found that 43 percent of Americans found watching porn to be morally acceptable \u2014 up from 36 percent in 2016. And people aren\u2019t just watching these sexy flicks alone, either: xHamster, a porn site, found that 20 percent of its viewers were watching porn with a partner in 2017.\n\nStill, many couples struggle to navigate this long-standing taboo.\n\nDr. Laurie Betito, a clinical psychologist who oversees Pornhub\u2019s two-year-old sex-education initiative, says that she sees many couples clam up about the subject. \u201cYou might know that your partner masturbates occasionally, and that they might use porn,\u201d she tells The Post. But insecurity and embarrassment keeps the conversation from progressing. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that people talk about so openly,\u201d she says.\n\nBut it\u2019s the secret-keeping \u2014 not necessarily the porn itself \u2014 that makes porn so troublesome to relationships in the first place, says Ayesha Hussain, founder of Brooklyn cinema the Violet, which screens ethical porn where consent is given on-screen. When one partner is \u201chiding\u201d their porn habit, the other will \u201cfeel lied to,\u201d she tells The Post. \u201cThat trust is broken when the other person is watching porn [in secret].\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like being at an orgy without having to talk to other people.\u2019\n\nPorn shame can also keep your partner from speaking up when there\u2019s a legitimate problem. That was the case for Jordan Bowditch, 30, of New Orleans, who realized he was addicted to porn during a long-term college relationship. \u201cI was embarrassed to talk about it, [and] she was afraid to bring it up,\u201d he tells The Post. Their sex life suffered as a result.\n\nNow, Bowditch and his partner Alexa Martinez, 30, work together to have \u201cvulnerable communication\u201d about their sexual needs.\n\n\u201cI put sex where it belongs: as a priority,\u201d says Martinez. She and Bowditch mutually masturbate and watch porn while on video chat when Bowditch travels for work. Because the two have very different sexual interests, porn also helps them teach each other what they\u2019re attracted to.\n\n\u201cBoth of us have reclaimed what porn means to us,\u201d Martinez says.\n\nPorn also plays an important role in sexual gratification for Rose and Patrick, an engaged millennial couple in an open relationship. The Bay Area pair, who use their middle names on dating apps for professional reasons, feel as though one person could never completely fulfill the other\u2019s sexual needs \u2014 and that\u2019s OK. Rose, who identifies as pansexual (someone whose attractions aren\u2019t limited by gender or sexual orientation), can seek out her sexual desires that Patrick can\u2019t offer her. \u201cPatrick doesn\u2019t have boobs. When I want that, he will never be able to satisfy me,\u201d she says.\n\nHussain recommends being honest with yourself about your intentions behind watching porn, like Rose and Patrick. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason you want to watch this? To share a new part of yourself with your partner? Do you find it arousing?\u201d\n\nWhatever type of conversation you want to have with your partner about porn, it\u2019s important to be as non-judgmental as possible, Betito says. \u201cDon\u2019t ask, \u2018Why do you watch porn,\u2019 but, \u2018Tell me about what porn is like for you,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cThat shows an openness to hearing the other person.\u201d\n\nAndrew and Carly agree \u2014 and add that opening the lines of communication around this steamy subject can lead to some hot, fun nights.\n\n\u201cI think the best way to introduce things sex-wise is when you\u2019re not in the bedroom,\u201d Carly says. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re on date night. You [can say], \u2018Hey, you wanna try something new? Let\u2019s watch some porn together.\u2019 \u201d",

  "text": "Federal authorities have charged a New York man with building a 200-pound bomb they say he planned to detonate on Election Day on the National Mall in Washington.\n\nPaul Rosenfeld, 56, of Tappan, was charged Wednesday with unlawfully manufacturing a destructive device and interstate transportation and receipt of an explosive.\n\nProsecutors said he planned to use the bomb to kill himself and draw attention to a political system called sortition, in which public officials are chosen randomly rather than elected.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Rosenfeld had an attorney. A message left with the federal public defender\u2019s office in White Plains, which often represents newly arrested criminal defendants, wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\nThe FBI raided Rosenfeld\u2019s home Tuesday and found a functional bomb in his basement that consisted of black powder inside a plywood box, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nAgents also found empty canisters of black powder often used in firearms and artillery, the complaint said.\n\nThe FBI said in court filings that Rosenfeld, after being pulled over on Tuesday, confessed to ordering large quantities of black powder over the internet and having the substance delivered to \u201ca location in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nRosenfeld took the black powder to New York, constructed smaller explosive devices and conducted test detonations, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nWilliam Sweeney Jr., the assistant director of the FBI\u2019s New York field office, said in a statement that Rosenfeld intended to \u201cdetonate a large explosive to kill himself and draw attention to his radical beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad he been successful, Rosenfeld\u2019s alleged plot could have claimed the lives of innocent bystanders and caused untold destruction,\u201d Sweeney said in the statement. \u201cFortunately, his plans were thwarted by the quick action of a concerned citizen and the diligent work of a host of our law enforcement partners and the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\u201d\n\nRosenfeld had an initial court appearance before a magistrate at a federal courthouse in White Plains on Wednesday afternoon.",

The dramatic episode took place approximately 164,000ft above the Earth but before the craft and its crew entered the Earth's orbit\n\nThe Soyuz spacecraft had just finished phase one of its launch process and was preparing to enter stage two when its boosters failed. Roscosmos announced they would launch a full-scale investigation into the cause of the incident just hours after the failed flight took place on Thursday afternoon\n\nRoscosmos, the Russian national space agency, and NASA said the three-stage Soyuz booster suffered an emergency shutdown during its second stage.\n\n'Thank God, the crew is alive,' Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when it became clear that the crew had landed safely.\n\nThe Soyuz rocket was due to dock at the orbiting outpost of the International Space Station six hours later, but the booster suffered a failure minutes after the launch.\n\nNASA and Russian Roscosmos space agency said the astronauts were in good condition after their capsule landed about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the city of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan.\n\nFormer military pilots Ovchinin and Hague were set to join Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, NASA's Serena Aunon-Chancellor and Sergey Prokopyev of Roscosmos following a six-hour flight.\n\nThe International Space Station - a rare point of cooperation between Moscow and Washington - has been orbiting the Earth at roughly 28,000 kilometres per hour since 1998 and will mark its 20th birthday in November.\n\nHow do you make an emergency landing in a Soyuz rocket? Two astronauts' dramatic 7G, 4,970mph ballistic re-entry The astronauts of the Soyuz MS-10 are said to have switched into 'ballistic descent mode' once they were notified of the second stage booster fault. This means the core automatically separated from the faulty booster and turned back to Earth. The rocket came in at a much sharper angle than normal, allowing the craft to head as quickly as possible to the ground. It is believed the rocket was travelling at more than 8,000 miles per hour (12,800kph) during its descent. The astronauts would have experienced G-force pressure as high as 7Gs. Rockets use boosters to provide the thrust they need to launch from Earth and breech the atmosphere. They set the trajectory for the flight, and if they aren't running at full capacity could send the rocket in completely the wrong direction. The Soyuz MS-10 rocket had four first-stage boosters strapped to its central core, which housed the second stage booster. A booster can fail for any number of reasons, including incorrect fuelling, mechanical faults, computer glitches and more. In the event of a booster failure, mission control will normally cancel the flight to avoid endangering the astronauts on board. The rocket is put into an emergency landing procedure in which the main module - holding all cargo and any astronauts on board - separates from the rocket early.\n\nRoskosmos cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin and astronaut Nick Haig pictured in the immediate aftermath of the terrifying incident. The pair are now in Zhezkazgan Kazakhstan and are being examined for any injuries or medical conditions arising from the 'ballistic descent'\n\nThe astronauts were forced to carry out a dramatic 'ballistic descent' in which they experienced G-forces of up to 7G at times. NASA said the emergency landing subjected the two astronauts to forces much greater than under normal circumstances as they hurtled back towards Earth\n\nThe craft's landing engines and parachute system were said to have done their job as normal despite the enormous G-force acting on both the shuttle and crew during the landing. According to NASA and Roscosmos, the spacecraft was unable to use its second-phase boosters after the initial separation\n\nThe spacecraft was said to have been travelling at 4,970mph as the boosters malfunctioned while carrying the two men into orbit. The Soyuz design was initially formulated in the 1960s and has formed the template for all future incarnations of the shuttle which has taken dozens of astronauts into space\n\nA view of the Soyuz MS-10 space capsule crash landed on the Kazakh steppe on Thursday.

The world's media had gathered for the launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome to herald the beginning of a joint project between the Russian and American space agencies\n\nNASA released a statement during the launch saying that the crew would be forced to attempt a 'ballistic re-entry' to get back to Earth safely. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement that Hague and Ovchinin are currently in good condition and will be transported to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City outside Moscow\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague (right) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin walk toward the shuttle after their space suits were tested prior to the launch on Thursday. The astronauts were due to dock at the International Space Station six hours after the launch, but the three-stage Soyuz booster suffered an unspecified failure of its second stage\n\nOver the past few years the Russian space industry has suffered a series of problems including the loss of a number of satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nRussia has continued to rely on Soviet-designed booster rockets for launching commercial satellites, as well as crews and cargo to the International Space Station.\n\nWho is Nick Hague? The NASA astronaut on the doomed Soyuz shuttle Hague is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 43-year-old rookie astronaut, who hails from Kansas, is a lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force. He attended the US Air Force Academy and the US Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Hague was selected by NASA as an astronaut in 2013 and completed training in 2015. With the failure of the October 11 mission, Hague became the first NASA Astronaut to make a sub-orbital flight since Virgil 'Gus' Grissom did so in Project Mercury. It would have been Hague's first trip into space.\n\nGlitches found in Russia's Proton and Soyuz rockets in 2016 were traced to manufacturing flaws at the plant in Voronezh. Roscosmos sent more than 70 rocket engines back to production lines to replace faulty components, a move that resulted in a yearlong break in Proton launches and badly dented Russia's niche in the global market for commercial satellite launches.\n\nOnly last month a hole was discovered in the International Space Station which Roscosmos claimed was drilled deliberately.\n\nRoscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin raised wide consternation by saying that the leak was a drill hole that was made intentionally during manufacturing or in orbit. He didn't say if he suspected any of the current crew of three Americans, two Russians and a German aboard the station.\n\nRoscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin, who watched the launch together with NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, tweeted that a panel has been set up to investigate the cause of the booster failure.\n\nThursday's failure was the first manned launch failure for the Russian space program since September 1983 when a Soyuz exploded on the launch pad.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said all manned launches will be suspended pending an investigation into the cause of the failure. He added that Russia will fully share all relevant information with the U.S.\n\nThe pair had been due to dock at the International Space Station six hours after the launch but an issue just three minutes in prevented them from continuing.

Russia claimed a hole had been drilled in the station prompting a dangerous drop in pressure which could have killed the astronauts on board",

  "text": "Two astronauts are alive after dramatically aborting their voyage to the International Space Station when their Russian Soyuz rocket malfunctioned while it carried them into orbit at 4,970mph.\n\nAmerican Nick Hague and Russian Aleksey Ovchinin were forced to abort their mission on the cusp of space, at an altitude of approximately 50km (164,000ft).\n\nThey landed safely in Kazakhstan after a 'ballistic re-entry', during which they experienced forces of up to 7G.\n\nVideo footage from the launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome shows a large plume of smoke coming from the rocket at the moment it failed and footage from inside the capsule shows the two astronauts being violently shaken about.\n\nThe secondary booster rocket failed shortly after the rocket jettisoned its first four booster rockets in stage-one separation at 164,000ft above the Earth but before the rocket entered orbit.\n\nThat meant automatic escape procedures kicked in and pointed the Soyuz capsule, that was designed in the 1960s and has seen 21 failures out of 745 launches, back to Earth.\n\nThe accident bears similarities to the 1986 Challenger disaster when one of its boosters failed at lift-off causing an explosion that killed seven.\n\nSearch and rescue teams were scrambled to the touchdown location as NASA revealed the descent meant the Russian-built Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft had to take 'a sharper angle of landing compared to normal'.\n\nIt comes weeks after a hole was discovered in the International Space Station amid talk from the Russian space authorities of deliberate sabotage. The Russians have suspended Soyuz flights to the space station while they investigate the cause of the booster failure.\n\nThe Soyuz is the only way to get people to the space station at the moment but officials insist the astronauts currently on the space station have enough supplies.\n\nThe Soyuz-FG rocket booster with Soyuz MS-10 space ship during the troubled ascent on Thursday from a launch station in remote Kazakhstan. The mission was a collaboration between NASA and Russia's national space agency Roscosmos and was aimed at replenishing manpower aboard the International Space Station\n\nThe two-man crew of NASA rookie Nick Hague and second-time flyer Aleksey Ovchinin in the cockpit of the spacecraft during take-off. Hague had never been aboard a space shuttle before Thursday's launch, with Ovchinin only having been into space once during a previous six-month posting to the International Space Station\n\nNASA rookie Nick Hague and second-time flyer Aleksey Ovchinin of the Russian space agency were setting off for a six-month mission at the International Space Station Thursday, on a relatively rare two-man launch.\n\nA spokesperson for NASA said that rescue teams have now reached Hague and Ovchinin and they've been taken out of the capsule and were in 'good condition'.\n\nThe craft's landing engines and parachute system were said to have done their job as normal despite the enormous G-force acting on both the shuttle and crew during the landing.\n\nShortly after the incident rescue crews and paratroopers were rushed the emergency landing site in the barren Kazakh steppe to provide support for the crew.\n\nNASA had issued a worrying tweet on Thursday morning saying: 'There's been an issue with the booster from today's launch. Teams have been in contact with the crew.'\n\n'The capsule is returning via a ballistic descent, which is a sharper angle of landing compared to normal. Search and rescue teams are heading towards the expected touchdown location of the spacecraft and crew.'\n\nCosmonaut Alexander Volkov commented: 'The guys are lucky that they remained alive. They had reached a good height so it was possible to descend in their capsule.'\n\nA massive plume of smoke could be seen firing out from behind the boosters in the dramatic moment the shuttle's engine failed during the launch phase. The astronauts on board were forced to make a dramatic emergency landing after the mid-air catastrophe occurred just three minutes into their six month mission\n\nSmoke pouring out of the engines of the Soyuz rocket during the first stage of its launch on Thursday afternoon after the engine malfunctioned. NASA officials later confirmed that the second-stage boosters had failed after all four of the initial boosters had been jettisoned\n\nA large cloud of dark-coloured smoke could be seen gathered in the wake of the spacecraft as it soared through the upper atmosphere. The dramatic episode took place approximately 164,000ft above the Earth but before the craft and its crew entered the Earth's orbit\n\nThe Soyuz spacecraft had just finished phase one of its launch process and was preparing to enter stage two when its boosters failed. Roscosmos announced they would launch a full-scale investigation into the cause of the incident just hours after the failed flight took place on Thursday afternoon\n\nRoscosmos, the Russian national space agency, and NASA said the three-stage Soyuz booster suffered an emergency shutdown during its second stage.\n\n'Thank God, the crew is alive,' Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when it became clear that the crew had landed safely.\n\nThe Soyuz rocket was due to dock at the orbiting outpost of the International Space Station six hours later, but the booster suffered a failure minutes after the launch.\n\nNASA and Russian Roscosmos space agency said the astronauts were in good condition after their capsule landed about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the city of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan.\n\nFormer military pilots Ovchinin and Hague were set to join Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, NASA's Serena Aunon-Chancellor and Sergey Prokopyev of Roscosmos following a six-hour flight.\n\nThe International Space Station - a rare point of cooperation between Moscow and Washington - has been orbiting the Earth at roughly 28,000 kilometres per hour since 1998 and will mark its 20th birthday in November.\n\nHow do you make an emergency landing in a Soyuz rocket? Two astronauts' dramatic 7G, 4,970mph ballistic re-entry The astronauts of the Soyuz MS-10 are said to have switched into 'ballistic descent mode' once they were notified of the second stage booster fault. This means the core automatically separated from the faulty booster and turned back to Earth. The rocket came in at a much sharper angle than normal, allowing the craft to head as quickly as possible to the ground. It is believed the rocket was travelling at more than 8,000 miles per hour (12,800kph) during its descent. The astronauts would have experienced G-force pressure as high as 7Gs. Rockets use boosters to provide the thrust they need to launch from Earth and breech the atmosphere. They set the trajectory for the flight, and if they aren't running at full capacity could send the rocket in completely the wrong direction. The Soyuz MS-10 rocket had four first-stage boosters strapped to its central core, which housed the second stage booster. A booster can fail for any number of reasons, including incorrect fuelling, mechanical faults, computer glitches and more. In the event of a booster failure, mission control will normally cancel the flight to avoid endangering the astronauts on board. The rocket is put into an emergency landing procedure in which the main module - holding all cargo and any astronauts on board - separates from the rocket early.\n\nRoskosmos cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin and astronaut Nick Haig pictured in the immediate aftermath of the terrifying incident. The pair are now in Zhezkazgan Kazakhstan and are being examined for any injuries or medical conditions arising from the 'ballistic descent'\n\nThe astronauts were forced to carry out a dramatic 'ballistic descent' in which they experienced G-forces of up to 7G at times. NASA said the emergency landing subjected the two astronauts to forces much greater than under normal circumstances as they hurtled back towards Earth\n\nThe craft's landing engines and parachute system were said to have done their job as normal despite the enormous G-force acting on both the shuttle and crew during the landing. According to NASA and Roscosmos, the spacecraft was unable to use its second-phase boosters after the initial separation\n\nThe spacecraft was said to have been travelling at 4,970mph as the boosters malfunctioned while carrying the two men into orbit. The Soyuz design was initially formulated in the 1960s and has formed the template for all future incarnations of the shuttle which has taken dozens of astronauts into space\n\nA view of the Soyuz MS-10 space capsule crash landed on the Kazakh steppe on Thursday. Rescuers who rushed to the aid of the two stranded astronauts took the revealing photo showing the stricken capsule lying on its side after the aborted mission to the International Space Station\n\nRescuers pack up the parachute gear attached to the Soyuz MS-10 space capsule. According to NASA the emergency landing devices and parachutes worked perfectly and neither of the two men on board the capsule were said to have been injured after the incident\n\nRoscosmos cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin (left) and NASA astronaut Nick Hague (second right) of the ISS Expedition 57/58 prime crew are escorted out of a military helicopter after being rescued in the barren Kazakh Steppe following their disaster launch on Thursday afternoon\n\nPhotographers take pictures as Russia's Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft jets into the sky during its launch in Kazakhstan on Thursday. The world's media had gathered for the launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome to herald the beginning of a joint project between the Russian and American space agencies\n\nNASA released a statement during the launch saying that the crew would be forced to attempt a 'ballistic re-entry' to get back to Earth safely. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement that Hague and Ovchinin are currently in good condition and will be transported to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City outside Moscow\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague (right) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin walk toward the shuttle after their space suits were tested prior to the launch on Thursday. The astronauts were due to dock at the International Space Station six hours after the launch, but the three-stage Soyuz booster suffered an unspecified failure of its second stage\n\nOver the past few years the Russian space industry has suffered a series of problems including the loss of a number of satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nRussia has continued to rely on Soviet-designed booster rockets for launching commercial satellites, as well as crews and cargo to the International Space Station.\n\nWho is Nick Hague? The NASA astronaut on the doomed Soyuz shuttle Hague is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 43-year-old rookie astronaut, who hails from Kansas, is a lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force. He attended the US Air Force Academy and the US Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Hague was selected by NASA as an astronaut in 2013 and completed training in 2015. With the failure of the October 11 mission, Hague became the first NASA Astronaut to make a sub-orbital flight since Virgil 'Gus' Grissom did so in Project Mercury. It would have been Hague's first trip into space.\n\nGlitches found in Russia's Proton and Soyuz rockets in 2016 were traced to manufacturing flaws at the plant in Voronezh. Roscosmos sent more than 70 rocket engines back to production lines to replace faulty components, a move that resulted in a yearlong break in Proton launches and badly dented Russia's niche in the global market for commercial satellite launches.\n\nOnly last month a hole was discovered in the International Space Station which Roscosmos claimed was drilled deliberately.\n\nRoscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin raised wide consternation by saying that the leak was a drill hole that was made intentionally during manufacturing or in orbit. He didn't say if he suspected any of the current crew of three Americans, two Russians and a German aboard the station.\n\nRoscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin, who watched the launch together with NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, tweeted that a panel has been set up to investigate the cause of the booster failure.\n\nThursday's failure was the first manned launch failure for the Russian space program since September 1983 when a Soyuz exploded on the launch pad.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said all manned launches will be suspended pending an investigation into the cause of the failure. He added that Russia will fully share all relevant information with the U.S.\n\nThe pair had been due to dock at the International Space Station six hours after the launch but an issue just three minutes in prevented them from continuing. Thursday's failure was the first manned launch failure for the Russian space programme since September 1983 when a Soyuz exploded on the launch pad\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague testing his space suit with the help of NASA and Roscosmos technicians prior to the launch sequence on Thursday. Both Hague and Ovchinin were inexperienced astronauts having graduated to their respective countries' space academies from careers in the US and Russian air forces\n\nThe two astronauts had been intended to carry out a six-month mission to the International Space Station which was discovered to be damaged last month. Russia claimed a hole had been drilled in the station prompting a dangerous drop in pressure which could have killed the astronauts on board",

Downed power lines and blocked roads stopped emergency crews getting to him in time.\n\nMore than 500,000 homes and businesses in Florida, Georgia and Alabama have been left without power as the storm moves north east before ending up in the Atlantic by Friday.\n\nIn terms of wind speed, Michael is the fourth strongest storm ever to hit the US after Andrew in 1992, Camille in 1969 and an unnamed Labor Day Hurricane in 1935 which had winds of 184mph.\n\nScientists say it was so strong because warm waters of 84F (29C) extended unusually far up the northern Gulf Coast for this time of year after Florida had its warmest September ever.\n\nHurricane-force winds extended outward up to 45 miles from the center and were tearing buildings apart in Panama City Beach after the hurricane made landfall on Wednesday afternoon\n\nBoats lay sunk and damaged at the Port St. Joe Marina.

It will head into the Atlantic Ocean by Friday\n\nThis graphic shows the projected path of the storm. It made landfall on Wednesday and will leave land by Friday\n\nWhy was Hurricane Michael so strong? Scientists say it was so strong because warm waters of 84F (29C) extended unusually far up the northern Gulf Coast for this time of year after Florida had its warmest September ever. It was also strong because the eyewall - the ring around the eye of the storm - formed late. This meant that there was not enough time for an eyewall replacement - a second ring formed of rainclouds - to form and weaken the storm. Normally, the so-called eyewall replacement cycle weakens a storm by 20-30mph - but Michael was at its strongest when it made landfall. Source: Dr Jeff Masters\n\nThe storm came ashore as a category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale, before it was downgraded to a category 3. By 8pm, it was down to a category 1.\n\nThe winds were so strong they brought down a billboard in Florida's Panama City, tore down a Texaco gas pumping station canopy in Inlet Beach and caused a storm surge that completely knocked a house off its foundations in Mexico Beach.\n\nBeachfront structures could be seen collapsing and metal roofing materials were blown away amid the heavy rain. Murky water was so high that roofs were about all that could be seen of many homes.\n\nHours earlier, meteorologists watched satellite imagery in complete awe as the storm intensified.\n\n'We are in new territory,' National Hurricane Center Meteorologist Dennis Feltgen wrote on Facebook. 'The historical record, going back to 1851, finds no Category 4 hurricane ever hitting the Florida panhandle.'\n\nThe University of Georgia's Marshall Shepherd called it a 'life-altering event'. More than 370,000 were ordered to evacuate but many refused.\n\nBy Wednesday night, the storm had moved north into South and North Carolina after sparking flash foods and property damage in Georgia.\n\nThe tropical storm moved across southwestern Georgia at about 20mph Wednesday night as it made its way northeast towards the Atlantic.\n\nA tornado watch is in effect across south and central Georgia until 2am Thursday. Dramatic footage showed homes and cars submerged in flood waters as the hurricane battered the Sunshine State.\n\nForecasters warned rain could reach up to a foot and the life-threatening storm surge could swell to 14 feet.\n\nMexico Beach councilwoman Linda Albrecht told CNN that she fears she won't have a home to go back to after the hurricane sweeps through the state.\n\n'It is extremely emotional,' she said, fighting tears. ;It's like a nightmare.

'This was set up a long time ago. We had thousands of people lined up from yesterday.\n\n'I mean literally they stayed 24 hours and sometimes more than that to go to these rallies. They like them. You probably saw the pictures on television tonight.\n\n'Thousands and thousands of people outside after the arena. It was a big arena. But it was full. We had 15 or beyond that thousand people outside. If I didn't go, that would have been the wrong thing too.'\n\nTrump said that he'd been in 'constant communication' with Florida governor Rick Scott and the governor of Alabama, and has 'people in Florida'.\n\nHe added that it had been a 'tough' storm, offering the insight: ' The wind was probably more dangerous than anything else.'\n\nPam Heckstall surveys the damage as the remnants of Hurricane Michael move through Panama City, Flaorida\n\nThe eye of the monstrous Hurricane Michael (pictured above) made landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida just before 2pm Wednesday and the eyewall came ashore minutes earlier between Panama City and St. Vincent Island\n\nHotel employees look at a canopy that had just collapsed as Hurricane Michael tore through Panama City Beach on Wednesday afternoon\n\nThe president (pictured at a rally on Wednesday) has come under fire for failing to visit Florida or the Carolinas as they are battered by the storm\n\nThe National Weather Service says tornadoes are possible across the Florida Panhandle, southeast Georgia and southern South Carolina through Thursday morning as the hurricane now moves inland.\n\nAuthorities told residents along the affected areas of Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast on Wednesday morning that they had run out of time to evacuate and should hunker down. More than 375,000 people had been urged or ordered to evacuate, but emergency authorities lamented that many people ignored the warnings and seemed to think they could ride it out.\n\nTHE STATS ON HURRICANE MICHAEL 155 mph: Top windspeed when it hit land as a category 4 hurricane, near Mexico Beach and Panama City, at around 2pm. 388,160: Customers without power in Florida as of Wednesday evening. Another 60,000 were without power in Alabama. 12 inches: Rain forecast to be dumped across the Florida Panhandle, the Big Bend region and parts of Alabama and Georgia. 375,000: The approximate number of Floridians who were under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders across parts of 18 counties. 14 feet: The maximum height forecast for the storm surge. 6,700: People in Florida's 54 shelters on Wednesday.\n\nA Red Cross official said it's possible that as many as 320,000 people on Florida's Gulf Coast did not evacuate and are likely riding out the storm. Emergency managers say they don't know how many left the area, but there were about 6,000 people in 80 shelters in five states, including nearly 1,200 who are still in shelters following Hurricane Florence.\n\nAfter the hurricane made landfall, Florida Governor Rick Scott urged those who didn't evacuate to stay in place.\n\n'We are still in the midst of a Category 4 catastrophic and historic storm. I urge all Floridians in the Panhandle to continue sheltering in place, and listening to local authorities. Stay inside until directed further so that our recovery teams can move in as quickly as possible,' he tweeted.\n\nScott had earlier said the hurricane would bring 'unimaginable devastation' and said he was 'scared to death' for those who ignored evacuation orders.\n\n'Our biggest concern is\u2026 the people that chose not to evacuate,' he told CNN. 'I worry about them every second and I hope there're no children there who didn't have the choice on their own to make these decisions.\n\n'I'm just praying for them and, as soon as this passes, we will be out there doing everything we can to rescue everybody\u2026 We will take care of each other.'\n\nThe head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, told President Trump in a briefing shortly before the eye of the storm hit that it was the 'worst kind' of hurricane.\n\n'Storm surge estimates are anywhere between nine and 14 feet. Storm surge is going to be the worse where eye makes landfall - just to the east or south of where the eye makes landfall\u2026 Coupled with that you have over 145 mph winds. Structures built before 2001 are not designed to handle that type of wind, typically,' Long said.\n\nCameras outside the International Space Station captured views of Hurricane Michael on Wednesday as the storm made landfall as a category 4 hurricane\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told CNN it would be a 'killer hurricane' and warned anyone in the path of the storm surge: 'You're going to die'.\n\nResidents and tourists were told to flee low-lying areas in at least 22 counties along the shore in Florida's Panhandle and adjacent Big Bend region.\n\nMeteorologists said it had the potential to become one of the worst storms in the history of the region as they watched satellite imagery in complete awe while the storm intensified.\n\n'I guess it's the worst-case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,' meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com said. 'This is going to have structure-damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.'\n\nNational Hurricane Center Meteorologist Dennis Feltgen added: 'We are in new territory. The historical record, going back to 1851, finds no Category 4 hurricane ever hitting the Florida Panhandle.'\n\nA satellite image of Michael took the terrifying shape of a skull as it roared closer to the Florida Panhandle as a fierce Category 4 storm on Tuesday.

A little over a day later, it had transformed into a monster. When it made landfall Wednesday afternoon, it was blowing at 155 mph. That's a 72 percent increase in wind speed in less than 33 hours. Meteorologists first got a sense something big could be happening by watching how Michael's eye changed shape. Moist air, warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and ideal wind patterns supercharged Hurricane Michael in the hours before it smacked Florida's Panhandle. Warm water is the energy that fuels hurricanes, and the Gulf water is 4 to 5 degrees warmer than normal. Source: Associated Press\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses.\n\nAbout 2,500 National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm preparations, and more than 4,000 others were on standby. Some 17,000 utility restoration workers were also on call.\n\nTrump was briefed on the hurricane on Wednesday prior to it making landfall and said he would visit the area early next week. He acknowledged that a lot of the residents in the area were poor and said it was probably tough to leave.\n\nMultiple airports were closed on Wednesday, including Tallahassee International Airport, Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, Pensacola International Airport and Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport.\n\nA total of 453 flights had been canceled on Wednesday across the country, with many occurring in the Florida area. Amtrak has also modified its service and is waiving fees for passengers who change their reservations.\n\nThe storm appeared to be so powerful that it is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves over Georgia early Thursday. Forecasters said it will unleash damaging wind and rain all the way into the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence's epic flooding.\n\nMichael is forecast to dump torrential rain over Florida, Alabama and Georgia, as well as the Carolinas and into Virginia. Up to a foot of rainfall was forecast for some areas.\n\nWaves started pounding a house in Alligator Point, Florida on Wednesday prior to Hurricane Michael making landfall\n\nBo Lynn's Market starts taking water in the town of Saint Marks as Hurricane Michael pushes the storm surge up the Wakulla and Saint Marks Rivers\n\nThe St. Marks River in Florida had already started to overflow into the city on Wednesday morning prior to the hurricane making landfall\n\nJayden Morgan carries his dog to safety through a flooded street in St. Marks as his family evacuates at the last minute before Hurricane Michael hits the state\n\nStreets in Okaloosa County were already experiencing minor flooding in the hours before Hurricane Michael was due to make landfall on Wednesday\n\nRoadways were already flooded in parts of Florida with Michael forecast to bring 155 mph destructive winds, up to a foot of rain and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 14 feet when it hits\n\nStrong winds had already caused trees to fall in Okaloosa County on Wednesday morning\n\nEscambia County Sheriff David Morgan bluntly advised residents choosing to ride it out that first-responders won't be able to reach them while Michael smashes into the coast.\n\n'If you decide to stay in your home and a tree falls on your house or the storm surge catches you and you're now calling for help, there's no one that can respond to help you,' Morgan said at a news conference.\n\nIn the small Panhandle city of Apalachicola, Mayor Van Johnson Sr. said the 2,300 residents were frantically preparing for what could be a strike unlike any seen there in decades. Many filled sandbags and boarded up homes and lined up to buy gas and groceries before leaving town.\n\n'We're looking at a significant storm with significant impact, possibly greater than I've seen in my 59 years of life,' Johnson said of his city on the shore of Apalachicola Bay, which where about 90 percent of Florida's oysters are harvested.\n\nThere will be no shelters open in Wakulla County, the sheriff's office warned on Facebook, because they are rated safe only for hurricanes with top sustained winds below 111 mph. With Michael's winds projected to be even stronger, residents were urged to evacuate inland.\n\n'This storm has the potential to be a historic storm, please take heed,' the sheriff's office said in the post.\n\nThe head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, told President Trump in a briefing shortly before the eye of the storm hit that it was the 'worst kind' of hurricane\n\nEmily Hindle lies on the floor at an evacuation shelter set up at Rutherford High School near Panama City Beach on Wednesday\n\nPeople wait for breakfast as they and others seek safety in a shelter in Panama City on Wednesday\n\nHeavy rains started lashing Panama City in Florida early Wednesday morning before Hurricane Michael was expected to make landfall\n\nHeavy surf from the approaching Hurricane Michael pounds the fishing pier on Okaloosa Island in Fort Walton Beach\n\nWorkers board the windows of Marco's Pizza on Tuesday as Hurricane Michael approaches in Panama City Beach, Florida\n\nPeople fill bags with sand at the Lynn Haven Sports Complex while preparing for Hurricane Michael in Panama City, Florida\n\nGeorgia governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency in 92 counties on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday in anticipation of wind damage, heavy rains and power outages.\n\nNorth Carolina's governor said he was afraid Hurricane Michael could slow the recovery for homeowners dealing with wind or flooding from Hurricane Florence.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper said Tuesday that Michael isn't expected to hit his state as hard as Florence did last month, but people shouldn't let their guard down, even if they're suffering from cleanup fatigue.

It will head into the Atlantic Ocean by Friday\n\nThis graphic shows the projected path of the storm. It made landfall on Wednesday and will leave land by Friday\n\nWhy was Hurricane Michael so strong? Scientists say it was so strong because warm waters of 84F (29C) extended unusually far up the northern Gulf Coast for this time of year after Florida had its warmest September ever. It was also strong because the eyewall - the ring around the eye of the storm - formed late. This meant that there was not enough time for an eyewall replacement - a second ring formed of rainclouds - to form and weaken the storm. Normally, the so-called eyewall replacement cycle weakens a storm by 20-30mph - but Michael was at its strongest when it made landfall. Source: Dr Jeff Masters\n\nThe storm came ashore as a category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale, before it was downgraded to a category 3. By 8pm, it was down to a category 1.\n\nThe winds were so strong they brought down a billboard in Florida's Panama City, tore down a Texaco gas pumping station canopy in Inlet Beach and caused a storm surge that completely knocked a house off its foundations in Mexico Beach.\n\nBeachfront structures could be seen collapsing and metal roofing materials were blown away amid the heavy rain.

'This was set up a long time ago. We had thousands of people lined up from yesterday.\n\n'I mean literally they stayed 24 hours and sometimes more than that to go to these rallies. They like them. You probably saw the pictures on television tonight.\n\n'Thousands and thousands of people outside after the arena. It was a big arena. But it was full. We had 15 or beyond that thousand people outside. If I didn't go, that would have been the wrong thing too.'\n\nTrump said that he'd been in 'constant communication' with Florida governor Rick Scott and the governor of Alabama, and has 'people in Florida'.\n\nHe added that it had been a 'tough' storm, offering the insight: ' The wind was probably more dangerous than anything else.'\n\nPam Heckstall surveys the damage as the remnants of Hurricane Michael move through Panama City, Flaorida\n\nThe eye of the monstrous Hurricane Michael (pictured above) made landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida just before 2pm Wednesday and the eyewall came ashore minutes earlier between Panama City and St. Vincent Island\n\nHotel employees look at a canopy that had just collapsed as Hurricane Michael tore through Panama City Beach on Wednesday afternoon\n\nThe president (pictured at a rally on Wednesday) has come under fire for failing to visit Florida or the Carolinas as they are battered by the storm\n\nThe National Weather Service says tornadoes are possible across the Florida Panhandle, southeast Georgia and southern South Carolina through Thursday morning as the hurricane now moves inland.\n\nAuthorities told residents along the affected areas of Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast on Wednesday morning that they had run out of time to evacuate and should hunker down. More than 375,000 people had been urged or ordered to evacuate, but emergency authorities lamented that many people ignored the warnings and seemed to think they could ride it out.\n\nTHE STATS ON HURRICANE MICHAEL 155 mph: Top windspeed when it hit land as a category 4 hurricane, near Mexico Beach and Panama City, at around 2pm. 388,160: Customers without power in Florida as of Wednesday evening. Another 60,000 were without power in Alabama. 12 inches: Rain forecast to be dumped across the Florida Panhandle, the Big Bend region and parts of Alabama and Georgia. 375,000: The approximate number of Floridians who were under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders across parts of 18 counties. 14 feet: The maximum height forecast for the storm surge. 6,700: People in Florida's 54 shelters on Wednesday.\n\nA Red Cross official said it's possible that as many as 320,000 people on Florida's Gulf Coast did not evacuate and are likely riding out the storm. Emergency managers say they don't know how many left the area, but there were about 6,000 people in 80 shelters in five states, including nearly 1,200 who are still in shelters following Hurricane Florence.\n\nAfter the hurricane made landfall, Florida Governor Rick Scott urged those who didn't evacuate to stay in place.\n\n'We are still in the midst of a Category 4 catastrophic and historic storm. I urge all Floridians in the Panhandle to continue sheltering in place, and listening to local authorities. Stay inside until directed further so that our recovery teams can move in as quickly as possible,' he tweeted.\n\nScott had earlier said the hurricane would bring 'unimaginable devastation' and said he was 'scared to death' for those who ignored evacuation orders.\n\n'Our biggest concern is\u2026 the people that chose not to evacuate,' he told CNN. 'I worry about them every second and I hope there're no children there who didn't have the choice on their own to make these decisions.\n\n'I'm just praying for them and, as soon as this passes, we will be out there doing everything we can to rescue everybody\u2026 We will take care of each other.'\n\nThe head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, told President Trump in a briefing shortly before the eye of the storm hit that it was the 'worst kind' of hurricane.\n\n'Storm surge estimates are anywhere between nine and 14 feet. Storm surge is going to be the worse where eye makes landfall - just to the east or south of where the eye makes landfall\u2026 Coupled with that you have over 145 mph winds. Structures built before 2001 are not designed to handle that type of wind, typically,' Long said.\n\nCameras outside the International Space Station captured views of Hurricane Michael on Wednesday as the storm made landfall as a category 4 hurricane\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told CNN it would be a 'killer hurricane' and warned anyone in the path of the storm surge: 'You're going to die'.\n\nResidents and tourists were told to flee low-lying areas in at least 22 counties along the shore in Florida's Panhandle and adjacent Big Bend region.\n\nMeteorologists said it had the potential to become one of the worst storms in the history of the region as they watched satellite imagery in complete awe while the storm intensified.\n\n'I guess it's the worst-case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,' meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com said. 'This is going to have structure-damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.'\n\nNational Hurricane Center Meteorologist Dennis Feltgen added: 'We are in new territory. The historical record, going back to 1851, finds no Category 4 hurricane ever hitting the Florida Panhandle.'\n\nA satellite image of Michael took the terrifying shape of a skull as it roared closer to the Florida Panhandle as a fierce Category 4 storm on Tuesday.

A little over a day later, it had transformed into a monster. When it made landfall Wednesday afternoon, it was blowing at 155 mph. That's a 72 percent increase in wind speed in less than 33 hours. Meteorologists first got a sense something big could be happening by watching how Michael's eye changed shape. Moist air, warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and ideal wind patterns supercharged Hurricane Michael in the hours before it smacked Florida's Panhandle. Warm water is the energy that fuels hurricanes, and the Gulf water is 4 to 5 degrees warmer than normal. Source: Associated Press\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses.\n\nAbout 2,500 National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm preparations, and more than 4,000 others were on standby. Some 17,000 utility restoration workers were also on call.\n\nTrump was briefed on the hurricane on Wednesday prior to it making landfall and said he would visit the area early next week. He acknowledged that a lot of the residents in the area were poor and said it was probably tough to leave.\n\nMultiple airports were closed on Wednesday, including Tallahassee International Airport, Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, Pensacola International Airport and Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport.\n\nA total of 453 flights had been canceled on Wednesday across the country, with many occurring in the Florida area. Amtrak has also modified its service and is waiving fees for passengers who change their reservations.\n\nThe storm appeared to be so powerful that it is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves over Georgia early Thursday. Forecasters said it will unleash damaging wind and rain all the way into the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence's epic flooding.\n\nMichael is forecast to dump torrential rain over Florida, Alabama and Georgia, as well as the Carolinas and into Virginia. Up to a foot of rainfall was forecast for some areas.\n\nWaves started pounding a house in Alligator Point, Florida on Wednesday prior to Hurricane Michael making landfall\n\nBo Lynn's Market starts taking water in the town of Saint Marks as Hurricane Michael pushes the storm surge up the Wakulla and Saint Marks Rivers\n\nThe St. Marks River in Florida had already started to overflow into the city on Wednesday morning prior to the hurricane making landfall\n\nJayden Morgan carries his dog to safety through a flooded street in St. Marks as his family evacuates at the last minute before Hurricane Michael hits the state\n\nStreets in Okaloosa County were already experiencing minor flooding in the hours before Hurricane Michael was due to make landfall on Wednesday\n\nRoadways were already flooded in parts of Florida with Michael forecast to bring 155 mph destructive winds, up to a foot of rain and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 14 feet when it hits\n\nStrong winds had already caused trees to fall in Okaloosa County on Wednesday morning\n\nEscambia County Sheriff David Morgan bluntly advised residents choosing to ride it out that first-responders won't be able to reach them while Michael smashes into the coast.\n\n'If you decide to stay in your home and a tree falls on your house or the storm surge catches you and you're now calling for help, there's no one that can respond to help you,' Morgan said at a news conference.\n\nIn the small Panhandle city of Apalachicola, Mayor Van Johnson Sr. said the 2,300 residents were frantically preparing for what could be a strike unlike any seen there in decades. Many filled sandbags and boarded up homes and lined up to buy gas and groceries before leaving town.\n\n'We're looking at a significant storm with significant impact, possibly greater than I've seen in my 59 years of life,' Johnson said of his city on the shore of Apalachicola Bay, which where about 90 percent of Florida's oysters are harvested.\n\nThere will be no shelters open in Wakulla County, the sheriff's office warned on Facebook, because they are rated safe only for hurricanes with top sustained winds below 111 mph. With Michael's winds projected to be even stronger, residents were urged to evacuate inland.\n\n'This storm has the potential to be a historic storm, please take heed,' the sheriff's office said in the post.\n\nThe head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, told President Trump in a briefing shortly before the eye of the storm hit that it was the 'worst kind' of hurricane\n\nEmily Hindle lies on the floor at an evacuation shelter set up at Rutherford High School near Panama City Beach on Wednesday\n\nPeople wait for breakfast as they and others seek safety in a shelter in Panama City on Wednesday\n\nHeavy rains started lashing Panama City in Florida early Wednesday morning before Hurricane Michael was expected to make landfall\n\nHeavy surf from the approaching Hurricane Michael pounds the fishing pier on Okaloosa Island in Fort Walton Beach\n\nWorkers board the windows of Marco's Pizza on Tuesday as Hurricane Michael approaches in Panama City Beach, Florida\n\nPeople fill bags with sand at the Lynn Haven Sports Complex while preparing for Hurricane Michael in Panama City, Florida\n\nGeorgia governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency in 92 counties on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday in anticipation of wind damage, heavy rains and power outages.\n\nNorth Carolina's governor said he was afraid Hurricane Michael could slow the recovery for homeowners dealing with wind or flooding from Hurricane Florence.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper said Tuesday that Michael isn't expected to hit his state as hard as Florence did last month, but people shouldn't let their guard down, even if they're suffering from cleanup fatigue. He said many houses that suffered roof damage in Florence are still covered in tarps and could be vulnerable to strong wind and rain.\n\nAs the storm moved north on Tuesday it battered Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba with drenching rains and winds of up to 80 mph.\n\nTorrential downpours and flash-flooding over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America after Michael formed off the coast of northern Honduras.\n\nHurricane Michael would be the first major hurricane to hit the panhandle since Hurricane Dennis in 2005, which made landfall near Pensacola, according to hurricane center data.\n\nThe sinister-looking skull appeared briefly on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite images on Tuesday as Hurricane Michael moved closer to Florida\n\nThe storm has triggered alerts stretching from southeast Louisiana all the way to the Tampa region",

Storm surge is going to be the worse where eye makes landfall - just to the east or south of where the eye makes landfall\u2026 Coupled with that you have over 145 mph winds. Structures built before 2001 are not designed to handle that type of wind, typically,' Long said.\n\nCameras outside the International Space Station captured views of Hurricane Michael on Wednesday as the storm made landfall as a category 4 hurricane\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told CNN it would be a 'killer hurricane' and warned anyone in the path of the storm surge: 'You're going to die'.\n\nResidents and tourists were told to flee low-lying areas in at least 22 counties along the shore in Florida's Panhandle and adjacent Big Bend region.\n\nMeteorologists said it had the potential to become one of the worst storms in the history of the region as they watched satellite imagery in complete awe while the storm intensified.\n\n'I guess it's the worst-case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,' meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com said. 'This is going to have structure-damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.'\n\nNational Hurricane Center Meteorologist Dennis Feltgen added: 'We are in new territory. The historical record, going back to 1851, finds no Category 4 hurricane ever hitting the Florida Panhandle.'\n\nA satellite image of Michael took the terrifying shape of a skull as it roared closer to the Florida Panhandle as a fierce Category 4 storm on Tuesday.

A little over a day later, it had transformed into a monster. When it made landfall Wednesday afternoon, it was blowing at 155 mph. That's a 72 percent increase in wind speed in less than 33 hours. Meteorologists first got a sense something big could be happening by watching how Michael's eye changed shape. Moist air, warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and ideal wind patterns supercharged Hurricane Michael in the hours before it smacked Florida's Panhandle. Warm water is the energy that fuels hurricanes, and the Gulf water is 4 to 5 degrees warmer than normal. Source: Associated Press\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses.\n\nAbout 2,500 National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm preparations, and more than 4,000 others were on standby. Some 17,000 utility restoration workers were also on call.\n\nTrump was briefed on the hurricane on Wednesday prior to it making landfall and said he would visit the area early next week. He acknowledged that a lot of the residents in the area were poor and said it was probably tough to leave.\n\nMultiple airports were closed on Wednesday, including Tallahassee International Airport, Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, Pensacola International Airport and Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport.\n\nA total of 453 flights had been canceled on Wednesday across the country, with many occurring in the Florida area. Amtrak has also modified its service and is waiving fees for passengers who change their reservations.\n\nThe storm appeared to be so powerful that it is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves over Georgia early Thursday. Forecasters said it will unleash damaging wind and rain all the way into the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence's epic flooding.\n\nMichael is forecast to dump torrential rain over Florida, Alabama and Georgia, as well as the Carolinas and into Virginia. Up to a foot of rainfall was forecast for some areas.\n\nWaves started pounding a house in Alligator Point, Florida on Wednesday prior to Hurricane Michael making landfall\n\nBo Lynn's Market starts taking water in the town of Saint Marks as Hurricane Michael pushes the storm surge up the Wakulla and Saint Marks Rivers\n\nThe St. Marks River in Florida had already started to overflow into the city on Wednesday morning prior to the hurricane making landfall\n\nJayden Morgan carries his dog to safety through a flooded street in St. Marks as his family evacuates at the last minute before Hurricane Michael hits the state\n\nStreets in Okaloosa County were already experiencing minor flooding in the hours before Hurricane Michael was due to make landfall on Wednesday\n\nRoadways were already flooded in parts of Florida with Michael forecast to bring 155 mph destructive winds, up to a foot of rain and a life-threatening storm surge of up to 14 feet when it hits\n\nStrong winds had already caused trees to fall in Okaloosa County on Wednesday morning\n\nEscambia County Sheriff David Morgan bluntly advised residents choosing to ride it out that first-responders won't be able to reach them while Michael smashes into the coast.\n\n'If you decide to stay in your home and a tree falls on your house or the storm surge catches you and you're now calling for help, there's no one that can respond to help you,' Morgan said at a news conference.\n\nIn the small Panhandle city of Apalachicola, Mayor Van Johnson Sr. said the 2,300 residents were frantically preparing for what could be a strike unlike any seen there in decades. Many filled sandbags and boarded up homes and lined up to buy gas and groceries before leaving town.\n\n'We're looking at a significant storm with significant impact, possibly greater than I've seen in my 59 years of life,' Johnson said of his city on the shore of Apalachicola Bay, which where about 90 percent of Florida's oysters are harvested.\n\nThere will be no shelters open in Wakulla County, the sheriff's office warned on Facebook, because they are rated safe only for hurricanes with top sustained winds below 111 mph. With Michael's winds projected to be even stronger, residents were urged to evacuate inland.\n\n'This storm has the potential to be a historic storm, please take heed,' the sheriff's office said in the post.\n\nThe head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, told President Trump in a briefing shortly before the eye of the storm hit that it was the 'worst kind' of hurricane\n\nEmily Hindle lies on the floor at an evacuation shelter set up at Rutherford High School near Panama City Beach on Wednesday\n\nPeople wait for breakfast as they and others seek safety in a shelter in Panama City on Wednesday\n\nHeavy rains started lashing Panama City in Florida early Wednesday morning before Hurricane Michael was expected to make landfall\n\nHeavy surf from the approaching Hurricane Michael pounds the fishing pier on Okaloosa Island in Fort Walton Beach\n\nWorkers board the windows of Marco's Pizza on Tuesday as Hurricane Michael approaches in Panama City Beach, Florida\n\nPeople fill bags with sand at the Lynn Haven Sports Complex while preparing for Hurricane Michael in Panama City, Florida\n\nGeorgia governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency in 92 counties on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday in anticipation of wind damage, heavy rains and power outages.\n\nNorth Carolina's governor said he was afraid Hurricane Michael could slow the recovery for homeowners dealing with wind or flooding from Hurricane Florence.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper said Tuesday that Michael isn't expected to hit his state as hard as Florence did last month, but people shouldn't let their guard down, even if they're suffering from cleanup fatigue. He said many houses that suffered roof damage in Florence are still covered in tarps and could be vulnerable to strong wind and rain.\n\nAs the storm moved north on Tuesday it battered Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba with drenching rains and winds of up to 80 mph.\n\nTorrential downpours and flash-flooding over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America after Michael formed off the coast of northern Honduras.\n\nHurricane Michael would be the first major hurricane to hit the panhandle since Hurricane Dennis in 2005, which made landfall near Pensacola, according to hurricane center data.\n\nThe sinister-looking skull appeared briefly on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite images on Tuesday as Hurricane Michael moved closer to Florida\n\nThe storm has triggered alerts stretching from southeast Louisiana all the way to the Tampa region",

  "text": "President Donald Trump defended his decision on Wednesday to leave the White House and stage a campaign rally in Pennsylvania even as the Florida Panhandle was being decimated by Hurricane Michael.\n\n\u2018This was set up a long time ago,\u2019 Trump said of the rally in Erie.\n\n\u2018We had thousands of people lined up from yesterday. They were lined up for 24 hours.\n\n\u2018If I didn\u2019t go, they would also criticize. If I didn\u2019t go that would have been the wrong thing, too,\u2019 the president told Fox News late Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended his decision on Wednesday to leave the White House and stage a campaign rally in Pennsylvania even as the Florida Panhandle was being decimated by Hurricane Michael\n\nAfter the rally, the president phoned in to Fox News and was interviewed on the air by host Shannon Bream\n\nThe decision to go to the rally stands in sharp contrast to Trump\u2019s criticism of then-President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2012, a week after Hurricane Sandy hit the New York area, Obama appeared at a campaign rally alongside Jay-Z and Bruce Springsteen in Ohio on the eve of the presidential election.\n\nTrump said that he he \u2018had everything set up on Air Force One\u2019 so that he was in contact with the governors of Florida, Alabama, and Georgia.\n\nHurricane Michael, the fiercest storm to hit Florida in a quarter century, was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday, adding it is expected to weaken further to a tropical storm by Thursday morning as it crosses the southeastern United States.\n\nMichael is moving across southwestern Georgia with damaging winds across the central and eastern Panhandle of Florida as well as southwestern and south-central Georgia, with storm flooding still occurring along the Gulf Coast, the NHC said.\n\nMichael, located about 20 miles southwest of Albany, Georgia and packing maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, is forecast to become post-tropical cyclone on Friday, the Miami-based weather forecaster said.\n\nAt least one man has been killed after a tree crashed through the roof of his Greenboro home and trapped him.\n\nEmergency crews were heading to the home, but downed power lines and blocked roads were making the trip difficult.\n\nHurricane Michael, the fiercest storm to hit Florida in a quarter century, was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday. The hurricane made landfall in Crawfordville, Florida (above) on Wednesday\n\nOfficials hadn't immediately confirmed the man's name.\n\nAs Hurricane Michael pounded Florida on Wednesday, Trump took shelter at the campaign event, where he sought to boost Republicans before the midterms.\n\nTrump acknowledged the hurricane at the top of his rally in Erie, offering his \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019 to those in the storm's path and promising to \u2018spare no effort\u2019 in the response.\n\nHe promised to travel to Florida \u2018very shortly.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018We will always pull through. ... We will always be successful at what we do.\u2019\n\nThen Trump turned back to politics.\n\nHis Pennsylvania rally was the latest stop on an all-out midterms blitz.\n\nWith weeks to go before the November elections, Trump and his fellow Republicans have been invigorated by the successful nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are seeking to use the contentious moment to unify the GOP and stave off Democratic energy at the polls.\n\nThat Trump kept his appointment in Erie underscored the importance of this effort to Republicans.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump received a hurricane briefing at the White House on the Category 4 storm.\n\nHe told reporters he faced a \u2018quagmire\u2019 about whether to attend the Pennsylvania rally because \u2018thousands of people\u2019 were already lined up for the event.\n\nThe decision to go to the rally stands in sharp contrast to Trump\u2019s criticism of then-President Barack Obama (center). In 2012, a week after Hurricane Sandy hit the New York area, Obama appeared at a campaign rally alongside Jay-Z (left) and Bruce Springsteen (right) in Ohio\n\nTrump, who won Pennsylvania in 2016, touted Republican Reps Mike Kelly and Lou Barletta.\n\nKelly is facing a challenge from Democrat Ron DiNicola, while Barletta is mounting an uphill campaign to unseat two-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.\n\nThe president, who attended a fundraiser before the rally, also praised GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner.\n\nAfter his comments about the hurricane, Trump pivoted to the midterms, celebrating Kavanaugh's appointment despite Democratic opposition and sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\nTrump called it a \u2018historic week,\u2019 saying, \u2018What the radical Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace.\u2019\n\nFor weeks Trump has been escalating his attacks on Democrats.\n\nHe continued that effort Wednesday, claiming that Democrats want to \u2018impose socialism and take over and destroy American health care.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country.\u2019\n\nTrump also returned to one of his favorite themes - reliving his stunning 2016 victory.\n\n\u2018Was that the most exciting evening?\u2019 he said to cheers.\n\nTrump also ticked through what he sees as his top achievements, including tax cuts and a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico.\n\nHe talked about exiting the Iran nuclear deal and drew wild applause for mentioning his plans for a Space Force.\n\nTrump attacked Casey for opposing Kavanaugh's nomination, saying he had 'joined the left-wing mob.'\n\nHe also accused Casey, named for his politician father, for \u2018banking on the name of his father.\u2019\n\nTrump's own father, Fred, was a successful real estate developer who set his son up in business.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported that Donald Trump received at least $413 million from his father over the decades, much of that through dubious tax dodges, including outright fraud.",

  "text": "Fair play \u2014 that\u2019s the winning game at Britain\u2019s top small employers. In challenging economic conditions, what sets the best companies apart is giving their people a fair deal. Although the 29,675 employees we surveyed for this list are less satisfied with every area of working life than last year, the top firms distribute budgets most evenly and prioritise wellbeing among their staff.\n\nThe top 10 businesses have the smallest proportion of employees earning less than \u00a325,000 a year \u2014 22% between them, compared with 27% at companies in positions 11 to 50, 30% in positions 51 to 100 and 34% for companies that did not make our list. The top 10 also had the lowest levels of people on more than \u00a345,000 (32%), while firms that made the list had a more even salary spread than the 267 that did not.\n\nA sense of whether or not employees get a \u201cfair deal\u201d is the biggest single differentiator between Britain\u2019s best 100 small companies and the rest, who score on average almost 15% worse in this area.\n\nView all of the Best Companies to Work For lists online at thesundaytimes.co.uk/best100companies\n\n\u201cThe companies at the top of the list seem to be more equitable,\u201d says Dr Ian Dennis, director of research at Best Companies Ltd, which compiles the list. \u201cThey distribute their budget for salaries more evenly among their people, leaving fewer at the lower end.\u201d\n\nThis is a particular achievement right now, says Jonathan Austin, Best Companies\u2019 chief executive. \u201cThese are tough times, there\u2019s less confidence and Brexit is creating a sense of unease,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the best small companies are more flexible in sharing the rewards of success and making sure policies and procedures are fair for all.\u201d\n\nThe Best Companies survey comprises 70 statements for employees to score from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d on a seven-point scale, designed to examine the components of a happy workplace. Scores are converted into an average for each statement, then expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible favourable response. For some statements, this is to agree strongly and for others it is to disagree. Statements in the questionnaire fall into eight areas:\n\n\u25a0 Leadership: how employees feel about company leaders.\n\n\u25a0 Wellbeing: how they feel about pressure levels and the balance of work and home life.\n\n\u25a0 My Manager: people\u2019s attitude to their immediate boss.\n\n\u25a0 My Team: how they feel about colleagues.\n\n\u25a0 Fair Deal: their contentment with pay and benefits.\n\n\u25a0 Giving Something Back: what their firm contributes to society, the environment and local community.\n\n\u25a0 My Company: people\u2019s affiliation with the whole company.\n\n\u25a0 Personal Growth: their view of training and scope for advancement.\n\nThis year has seen a marginal decline in average scores for all eight of these factors, with engagement levels falling on 58 questions in the survey. But, although Fair Deal results dropped by about 1.5% from 2017 overall, the companies that made the list scored better on this factor, as they did on Leadership.\n\nOverall, the two factors that distinguished this year\u2019s top 10 were Fair Deal and Wellbeing \u2014 both on average more than 10% higher than companies ranking 11th to 100th.\n\nInzpire high-flyers Al Allsop and Mark Dooney JACK WELSON/RAF\n\nThis year\u2019s number one, Hakim Group, is a prime example of both. A group of independent opticians based in Darwen, Lancashire, it has a support team offering services such as PR, finance and IT to the 61 practices under its umbrella. The practice owners \u2014 who have sold a share of their business to the group and pay a monthly fee \u2014 keep their sense of independence and share of the profits.\n\nFor Liz Jackson, who runs Oakwood Eyecare in Derby with her husband, Tom, this split gives them the best of both worlds. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken on back-office support, but it\u2019s still our business,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have had a \u00a340,000 refit, developed a new website and have support on social media. We have a group mentality but our own practice, focused on giving an outstanding experience.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s chief executive, Imran Hakim \u2014 also this year\u2019s Best Leader \u2014 believes a business will be happy if its people are happy. \u201cIf you can make a difference to the people you care about, while running a profitable business, that\u2019s a great place to be,\u201d he says.\n\nCompanies that have done well this year have prioritised staff wellbeing, according to Dennis. \u201cIf you look at areas where there has been an improvement in the small companies, they are about work-life balance,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship where people are willing to be flexible when the pressure is on the company, whether that\u2019s avoiding redundancies or dealing with an influx of work \u2014 and the company being flexible when people have pressures from their outside life.\u201d\n\nThree questions that showed a marginal improvement this year related to people\u2019s levels of energy on returning home after work, not spending too much time on their jobs and having a happy balance with home life.\n\nAt the defence technology and training company Inzpire, this meant introducing an uncapped paid leave policy. Head of support services Rich Havercroft says this has meant people taking up to two extra days off, but the firm gains too.\n\n\u201cWe operate to a great extent on discretionary effort from employees,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou know the company will treat you well, and don\u2019t mind staying a bit later and putting in a bit of work at the weekend. It was about doing the right thing for the staff, and a message to say: we trust you.\u201d\n\nJasmine Pepper is part of the Lintbells team improving pets\u2019 health PETER TARRY\n\nJust going to work is a breath of fresh air at animal supplements firm Lintbells, which is based in a Hertfordshire farm. This new entry, which sees dogs, horses and cats as customers, promotes caring for people and the planet too. \u201cThere\u2019s an energy to it as we represent a purpose,\u201d says co-founder John Howie.

  "text": "Thomas Caldwell once told a federal agent that selling guns was an addiction.\n\nEven after being told to stop because he had no license, the Wisconsin man kept peddling firearms, posting more than 200 ads on a controversial website.\n\nOne of those guns, a Glock 26 9 mm handgun, ended up in the hands of a four-time felon who used it in February to kill Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer in a shocking daylight shooting in the heart of the Loop, according to recently filed federal documents.\n\nThe records give a rare look at how shadowy gun deals flourish between private owners and over the internet \u2014 how easy and lucrative they are. And how lethal they can be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that gun changed hands and came from out of state,\u201d said former Chicago police First Deputy Superintendent John Escalante, Bauer\u2019s childhood friend. \u201cI think they (gun sellers) don\u2019t want to think about that. They are seeing the bottom line, which is money in their hands. If that gun winds up being used to shoot someone, they\u2019re thinking, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t shoot the guy. I didn\u2019t pull the trigger.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported in March how the gun \u2014 known as a \u201cBaby Glock\u201d for its compact size \u2014 made its way from a gun shop near Madison, Wis., to Lower Wacker Drive in Chicago. Now the open and unregulated market that carried it into Chicago has come into sharper focus as federal charges have been filed against Caldwell and a second Wisconsin man, Ron Jones.\n\nTracking the \u2018Baby Glock\u2019 that killed Cmdr. Bauer: A Wisconsin shop, a gun club and a shadowy sale on the internet \u00bb\n\nAgreed to stop selling guns\n\nIn the hours after Bauer\u2019s death, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced the Baby Glock to a man who bought it from the gun shop in December 2011, according to federal records reviewed by the Tribune. From there, the investigation led federal agents to Caldwell. But this wasn\u2019t the first time he had appeared on the ATF\u2019s radar, court documents show.\n\nCaldwell first drew the agency\u2019s attention in June 2015 when Milwaukee police found a Glock 29 10 mm pistol while serving a search warrant at a felon\u2019s home during a narcotics investigation. Police ran the gun\u2019s serial number through a national law enforcement database and learned that Caldwell had bought the firearm the day before from a licensed dealer.\n\nIn a video obtained by the Tribune, Shomari Legghette is taken into custody on Feb. 13, 2018 after the fatal shooting of Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer outside the Thompson Center. In a video obtained by the Tribune, Shomari Legghette is taken into custody on Feb. 13, 2018 after the fatal shooting of Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer outside the Thompson Center. SEE MORE VIDEOS\n\nFour months later, the ATF conducted what it calls a compliance inspection of the dealer and learned that Caldwell had bought 41 guns from him in a year. The agency also discovered that Caldwell had had no reportable income since 2012.\n\nSometimes the dealer would have several handguns to sell to Caldwell, according to the ATF. But Caldwell would buy only one of them at a time, every six days, to get around a federal requirement that the dealer report the purchase of two or more firearms by the same buyer within a five-day period, according to court records.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was doing it as a business,\u201d Caldwell said during a court hearing last month in Madison while pleading guilty to a federal charge of selling firearms without a license. \u201cI thought it was legal, but it was brought to my attention it was illegal.\u201d\n\nCaldwell, 68, told the ATF he was paid about $21,000 each year in Social Security and disability checks. He bought about 30 to 40 guns a year, spending roughly $2,000 a month on them. He sold the guns he didn\u2019t like through armslist.com \u2014 a website that connects buyers and sellers of weapons without requiring registration, proof of identity or background checks.\n\nWhen the ATF asked Caldwell about the gun seized in Milwaukee, he said he had no record of it in a notebook he kept of his firearm transactions.\n\nBy the end of 2015, the ATF served Caldwell with a letter warning him to stop selling guns until he got licensed.\n\n\u201cMr. Caldwell signed the warning letter, and he told (an ATF agent) he would stop selling guns,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy O\u2019Shea said during the hearing last month. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Caldwell filed for bankruptcy. He listed among his assets 47 guns \u2014 24 rifles, 22 handguns and a shotgun \u2014 worth a total of $9,300.\n\nBaby Glock reaches Chicago\n\nCaldwell had bought the Baby Glock in March 2015 for about $350 from the man who had purchased it from the gun shop outside Madison. The two belonged to the same gun club. Two years later, Caldwell sold it to a Milwaukee man named Ron Jones \u2014 whom Caldwell knew as \u201cKevin Sweepee\u201d \u2014 over armslist.com, according to federal authorities.\n\nThe two had done business before, further evidence of the extent of Caldwell\u2019s gun selling.\n\nCaldwell told the ATF that Jones bought at least 15 guns from him over a five-year period. Jones was once arrested on felony drug charges, but they were later dropped. Jones told federal agents he spoke by phone with Caldwell about three times a month about gun sales.\n\nThe Baby Glock appears to have landed on the streets of Chicago by the summer of 2017, about two months after Caldwell sold it to Jones. Shell casings found at the scene of a Loop shooting on July 10 that year were traced to the Glock.\n\nA man was sitting in a car at Garland Court and Lower Wacker Place \u2014 just blocks from where Bauer was shot months later \u2014 when he was shot in the side. The man, 33, told police someone in a passing black sedan shot him, but he changed his story and then refused to cooperate, a source said.\n\nNo charges were filed, and it\u2019s unclear how the gun got into Chicago.\n\nMeanwhile, Caldwell continued to sell firearms in Wisconsin, and the transactions once again caught the attention of the ATF.\n\nChicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot and killed near the Thompson Center in the Loop on Feb. 13, 2018.\n\nIn fall 2017, Madison police confiscated a Taurus 9 mm handgun from a reputed drug trafficker. Police traced it and discovered that Caldwell had bought the gun just two weeks earlier. ATF Special Agent Michael Klemundt, a former Chicago police officer, conducted a background investigation and learned that Caldwell still was not licensed as a firearms dealer.\n\nCaldwell had posted 202 ads for gun sales on armslist.com after getting the warning letter, the ATF found. He also had bought at least 95 handguns and 11 rifles from nearly 60 different sellers during that time. At least 11 firearms recovered during police investigations were traced back to Caldwell between 2004 and 2017, according to court documents.\n\nIn December of 2017, ATF agents, working undercover as part of their investigation of Caldwell, met him at his Madison home and bought a Walther P99 .40-caliber handgun for $500. The meeting was arranged through armslist.com.",

  "text": "The handgun used to kill Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer began its tragic path in December 2011 at a small shop in south-central Wisconsin.\n\nThe 9 mm Glock passed through several owners over the next six years \u2014 first through a private transaction at a rustic gun club, then peddled over the internet to a Milwaukee man with an arrest record, a law enforcement source told the Chicago Tribune. It finally surfaced in Chicago, allegedly winding up in the hands of Shomari Legghette, a four-time felon now charged with murder in Bauer\u2019s slaying.\n\nThe familiar but disastrous storyline has emerged amid a sprawling gun trace investigation by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Federal authorities raided the Wisconsin homes of two of the gun\u2019s sellers earlier this month and found dozens of firearms at each, as well as evidence of a Chicago connection, the source said.\n\nThe gun\u2019s trail was facilitated by looser Wisconsin regulations that allow private sales with no background checks and a controversial online gun marketplace that critics say makes it easy for felons to acquire weapons illegally, according to evidence uncovered in the probe.\n\nIt has also revealed that Bauer\u2019s killing likely wasn\u2019t the first time the Glock was used in downtown violence. Ballistics evidence shows that seven months before Bauer\u2019s slaying, the source said, the same Glock pistol appeared to have been used in a shooting on Lower Wacker Place, not far from where the police chase of Legghette began Feb. 13.\n\nIn the wake of the tragic slayings of 17 people inside a Florida high school, much of the attention in the national gun debate has been on the sale of assault weapons.\n\nBut the journey of the pistol used to kill Bauer \u2014 commonly called a \u201cBaby Glock\u201d because of its compact size \u2014 raises questions about a more common and troubling part of the gun pipeline in the United States: the everyday transactions of smaller guns that fuel so much of the violence in cities like Chicago, where more than 7,800 people have been shot and more than 1,400 slain in just the last two years.\n\nTo many who study gun violence, the Glock\u2019s path to Chicago is powerful evidence of the need for more regulation in the secondary gun market, where weapons change hands with little or no oversight, such as background checks or mandatory paperwork to document sales. Its sale over the internet highlights an emerging concern among gun control advocates that selling guns is getting even easier.\n\nGun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association have vehemently fought steps to bring more regulation, arguing that it\u2019s the only way to ensure that the government doesn\u2019t amass a registry of gun owners or interfere with the right to own a gun.\n\nATF and Chicago police declined to comment for this story.\n\nAfter Bauer\u2019s killing, the original owner of the 9 mm Glock handgun watched news coverage of the mournful police procession that carried Bauer\u2019s body to the morgue. On Feb. 14, ATF agents knocked on his door with the news that the same gun had been used in a high-profile incident in Chicago \u2014 a reference he later realized was to Bauer\u2019s killing. It was difficult to fathom, he said, that the gun he\u2019d sold to a fellow member of his shooting club in 2015 wound up causing such a horrific and violent act in Chicago a few years later.\n\n\u201cI almost came to tears,\u201d the man told a Tribune reporter, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the story. \u201cHe went to help his fellow officers.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s remorseful over what happened, even though he did everything legally and knows the suspected killer could have easily obtained another gun elsewhere.\n\nStanding in the doorway of his home on a recent afternoon, the man seemed haunted by Bauer\u2019s death. He said he would no longer sell weapons to people at his club, a sprawling facility that focuses on sport shooting and stresses gun safety and responsible ownership.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never do it there again,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it seemed reasonably safe.\u201d\n\nAntonio Perez / Chicago Tribune According to a law enforcement source, the Glock used to kill Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer was purchased in December 2011 from PT Firearms in Cross Plains, Wis. According to a law enforcement source, the Glock used to kill Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer was purchased in December 2011 from PT Firearms in Cross Plains, Wis. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune)\n\n\u2018Guns are welcome\u2019\n\nWhile Illinois is the largest single source for guns later used in crimes in Chicago, weapons also make their way to Chicago\u2019s deadly streets by way of states like Indiana, Mississippi and Wisconsin, according to a city of Chicago trace data report from 2017. Wisconsin ranked fourth on the list, with about 4 percent of Chicago\u2019s crime guns sold at dealers in that state.\n\nThe gun used in Bauer\u2019s killing was a Glock 26. At only 6\u00bd inches long, the subcompact Model 26 pistol has been the company\u2019s most sought after \u201cconcealed-carry option\u201d since its release in 1994, according to the gun-maker\u2019s website. It has a standard magazine capacity of 10 rounds, although at the time of Bauer\u2019s killing the gun had been fitted with an extended-capacity magazine capable of holding up to 30 rounds.\n\nAccording to the law enforcement source, the Glock was purchased in December 2011 from a gun shop called PT Firearms in Cross Plains, Wis., a quiet town of about 3,500 people just outside Madison.\n\nThe shop is now tucked away in a large strip mall offering a slice of small-town America \u2014 a variety store selling children\u2019s toys, lawn chairs and other items, a Piggly Wiggly supermarket, and Subway and Culver\u2019s restaurants. A sign in the window reads: \u201cGUNS ARE WELCOME ON PREMISES.\u201d\n\nOn a recent cold, sunny Friday afternoon, rifles were stacked on the wall while handguns \u2014 some of them revolvers \u2014 sat in display cases at the counters. Gun cases, pistol grips, adhesive targets, scopes and pepper spray were on display throughout. Ammunition magazines for AR and AK rifles were also on sale. Signs in the store advertised \u201cgovernment contract AR Mags two for $25\u201d and \u201csteel AK Mags $15 each.\u201d\n\nDuring a visit by a Tribune reporter, a customer appeared to inspect a rifle while talking to an employee while a dog roamed around the store. A man who identified himself as the store\u2019s assistant manager declined to comment directly about Bauer\u2019s death but said, \u201cWe\u2019re strong supporters of law enforcement. We always have been.\u201d\n\nThe assistant manager said the store has been around for about nine years and that the clientele ranges from blue-collar people to businessmen. He said he and his employees will not sell a gun to someone if they believe that person will not use it \u201cfor the right reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control people who walk out the door,\u201d he said. \u201c(We\u2019re) doing our best to be a gatekeeper at the counter.\u201d\n\nNo background check",

  "text": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel continued his \u201cno friend gets left on the field\u201d tour Wednesday, handing out $20,000 checks to more than two dozen City Council allies to help them get re-elected.\n\nEmanuel hosted a breakfast at the 312 Chicago restaurant across the street from City Hall. Far North Side Ald. Joseph Moore, 49th, said he expected to enjoy a meal and a thank-you speech from the mayor to aldermen who backed Emanuel\u2019s series of property tax hikes and other politically difficult votes.\n\nEmanuel did thank them, Moore said, but then he also handed out $20,000 checks. Moore\u2019s check was made out to his re-election fund, he said.\n\n\u201cChristmas in October,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIn addition to eggs, potatoes and bacon, we got checks.\u201d\n\nMoore, who\u2019s facing a potentially difficult re-election fight, said he will use the money to help pay for his campaign.\n\nAnother alderman in attendance, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he, too, was caught off guard by the payout and said he might use the money to pay for community projects. \u201cI just expected breakfast,\u201d the alderman said.\n\nIn all, Emanuel paid out around half a million dollars to friendly aldermen. The famously capable fundraiser has millions of dollars in his campaign fund, money he said he would return to donors after his surprise announcement last month that he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term.\n\nEmanuel has pledged to go to bat for aldermen who have backed him for the past seven-plus years. He attended a fundraiser last month for Public Safety Committee Chairman Ald. Ariel Reboyras, 30th, who\u2019s trying to get re-elected against Jessica Gutierrez, daughter of outgoing U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez.\n\n\u201cYou got a great alderman,\u201d Emanuel said at Reboyras\u2019 fundraiser. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you to make sure your neighbors know how good he is.\u201d\n\nAsked about his backing of Reboyras, Emanuel cited his mantra from his days as head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee: \u201cNo friend gets left on the field.\u201d\n\nEmanuel, who's unpopular in some parts of the city, might be able to best help re-election-seeking aldermen by cutting them checks and staying out of their way. While $20,000 isn\u2019t a large outlay for the deep-pocketed mayor, it can make a big difference in a down-ballot ward-level race.\n\nA close Emanuel adviser confirmed the breakfast and the fact that the mayor handed out $20,000 checks to more than two dozen of his aldermanic allies. A list of exactly who received the checks was not immediately available, although aldermen will have to disclose the contributions to state election officials within 48 hours of depositing them into their campaign funds.\n\n\u201cThe mayor has a lot of money left over from his campaign, and he wanted to thank them for standing with him and making a lot of difficult decisions and taking a lot of difficult votes,\u201d said the adviser, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the event. \u201cIt\u2019s a sentiment you\u2019ll see echoed in his budget speech next week.\u201d\n\nAmong those who attended: Alds. Moore, Nicholas Sposato, 38th; Margaret Laurino, 39th; Patrick O\u2019Connor, 40th; Carrie Austin, 34th; and Roderick Sawyer, 6th, chairman of the council\u2019s Black Caucus. Some mayoral allies who \u201cdon\u2019t need the money\u201d did not receive checks, including longtime powerful Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, the Emanuel adviser confirmed.\n\nIronically, Emanuel\u2019s eighth and final budget may be the easiest for aldermen to vote on, as it\u2019s not expected to contain any major tax increases or overhaul of city services, an occurrence that is not uncommon in an election year.\n\nThe mayor, though, has asked plenty of them in the past, as aldermen voted to approve a record $534 million property tax increase and a series of fee and fine increases necessary to shore up the city\u2019s budget and stabilize its woefully underfunded public employee pensions. In the 2015 budget alone, aldermen passed $755 million in new taxes and fees at Emanuel\u2019s request.\n\nThere were also other politically difficult votes, including the elimination of the ward-by-ward garbage collection and a major increase in water rates to rebuild much of the city\u2019s sewer system.\n\nFor much of his tenure, Emanuel has enjoyed widespread council support and has not had to sweat out many close votes. Controlling most of the specifics on how and where the city\u2019s money gets spent, the mayor has not been shy about wielding his power behind the scenes to bully and reward aldermen into supporting his initiatives.\n\nAt times, though, aldermen have sent a message, including in 2016 when Emanuel mustered the bare minimum 26 votes in passing up to $3.5 billion in borrowing for O\u2019Hare International Airport. Many black aldermen voted no in protest of not enough minority contracts being awarded at the airport.\n\nEmanuel long has been a prolific fundraiser, going back to his days working on predecessor Richard M. Daley\u2019s 1989 mayoral campaign and former President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign. The mayor spent more than $27 million on his 2015 re-election bid and already had raised more than $10 million toward another run when he made the stunning announcement last month that he would abandon his bid for a third term.\n\nIn an interview after that announcement, Emanuel told the Chicago Tribune that he would be giving the remaining money back to his campaign fund to donors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to return it to everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s theirs, not mine. It\u2019s not my money, it\u2019s their money.\u201d\n\nThe Emanuel adviser said the campaign has been working on a formula to determine how much money donors will receive back since Emanuel spent some of the money. They all are likely to receive a flat percentage of their original contribution.\n\nThat pool of money is at least $500,000 lighter after Emanuel\u2019s buffet of breakfast checks.\n\njebyrne@chicagotribune.com\n\nbruthhart@chicagotribune.com",

  "text": "Three people were carjacked over 40 minutes in Lakeview and Lincoln Park late Wednesday and early Thursday -- and two of the stolen cars were later found in the same South Side police district, one parked and the other crashed, according to Chicago police.\n\nThose carjacked included a food delivery driver robbed at gunpoint and two women, police said.\n\nAbout 5 minutes before midnight, two people walked up to a 25-year-old woman on the sidewalk in the 1600 block of West Barry Avenue in Lakeview. At least one of them had a handgun, and they took her keys and drove off in her red Toyota Corolla, police said.\n\nAbout half an hour later, two more carjackings took place minutes apart in the 800 block of West Dickens Avenue in the Sheffield Neighbors neighborhood and a half-mile away in the 800 block of West Willow Street in the Ranch Triangle, both in the Lincoln Park community area.\n\nTwo people went up to a 20-year-old man delivering food on West Dickens, showed a gun and took his 2011 black Toyota, iPhone, driver's license and $10, police said.\n\nAbout 12 minutes later, a person knocked on a rear door of a Ford Fusion parked on West Willow, implied he was armed and told a 26-year-old woman inside the car to get out. A second person pulled the woman from the car, and both suspects got in and left, police said. No injuries were reported.\n\nLater, in the South Side\u2019s Grand Crossing police district, the Corolla was seen traveling behind the white Fusion. After a short pursuit, the Corolla crashed in the 400 Block of East Marquette Road in West Woodlawn, police said. When police found it, the suspects were gone.\n\nOfficers patrolling the area came across the Fusion, parked and unoccupied, in the Park Manor neighborhood near East 69th Street and South Anthony Avenue, police said.\n\nAfter both cars were processed for evidence, detectives said there was a \u201cprobable connection\u201d between those two carjackings, though police have not determined whether the carjacking of the delivery driver is related.",

  "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-michelle-obama-program-20181010-story.html#nt=oft02a-1li3",
  "text": "Former first lady Michelle Obama has launched an international program that aims to support groups and community leaders who work to educate girls around the world, she announced on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Global Girls Alliance is a collective of smaller, grassroots organizations working to get girls in school and get them educated, officials said. In her role, Obama will work through the Obama Foundation to highlight those groups, promote their work and steer donors their way.\n\n\u201cWe want to lift up the grassroots leaders in communities all over the world who are clearing away the hurdles that too many girls face,\u201d Obama said in a statement. \u201cBecause the evidence is clear: educating girls isn\u2019t just good for the girls, it\u2019s good for all of us.\u201d\n\nIn their announcement, Obama Foundation officials couldn\u2019t say how many organizations are a part of the alliance and they didn\u2019t reveal specific fundraising goals. The foundation also wouldn\u2019t reveal how much it is investing in the program or how much of its resources will support it.\n\nBut while foundation officials were fuzzy about the details, the announcement signals how Obama will use her influence as a former first lady now that she has been out of the White House for more than a year.\n\nIt is the first program Obama has launched through the foundation, which is based in the South Side community where she worked and lived. In addition to its programming, the foundation is responsible for constructing the Obama Presidential Center.\n\nREAD MORE: Chicago's hottest ticket? It's Michelle Obama's book tour. \u00bb\n\nDuring her visits to Chicago, Obama has spoken about her vision for the center and said that it would bring public art to a community with struggling neighborhoods that need it. But aside from her visits, where she often makes time to sit and talk with high school students, Obama has been mostly quiet since the family left the White House.\n\nObama grew up in the South Side\u2019s South Shore neighborhood and touts her Chicago upbringing in nearly every public speech. She was once the primary breadwinner for her family. Yet, her law career was placed on hold when her husband became president and she focused instead on programs promoting girls and healthy children. As first lady, she charmed and delighted the public in speeches, interviews and appearances.\n\nAfter the family left the White House, she said she was looking forward to returning to a normal life.\n\nBut last month, Obama announced that she finished writing her memoir and would kick off her grand-scale book tour here in Chicago at the United Center.\n\nShortly after the book tour announcement, Obama jumped into a national effort to get residents registered to vote.\n\nOn Thursday, she said she was turning some of her attention toward elevating programs that work to educate girls because there are 98 million young girls that are not in school. In many countries, younger girls get diverted from their education because of work, motherhood and family obligations. In other regions, education is prohibited and opportunities limited.\n\nStill, studies show that girls who are educated earn more, are better able to support their families and tend to be healthier and more engaged. Although Obama\u2019s initiative is new, the programs it spotlights are not, like the Campaign for Female Education, or CAMFED, which has offices in the United Kingdom and United States and throughout Africa; Rise Up, which is based in California; and the Study Hall Educational Foundation in India.\n\nIn addition to highlighting those groups, Obama\u2019s program will have a GoFundMe page, which directs donors to the programs and charities she supports with this effort. Obama\u2019s program will also encourage young people to get involved with these groups and turn their passions into action.\n\nObama kicked off the announcement of her new program Thursday morning with a televised conversation and performances by Kelly Clarkson, Meghan Trainor and Chicago\u2019s Jennifer Hudson.\n\nlbowean@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @lollybowean\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\nMichelle Obama reportedly officiated Chicago couple's wedding \u00bb\n\nColumn: Michelle Obama and George W.

  "text": "Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here.\n\nTopspin\n\nThe final scheduled televised debate between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker is set for this evening in Quincy, the site of the veterans home where more than a dozen veterans have died from Legionnaires\u2019 disease over the last three years.\n\nThe only Downstate debate of the campaign is hosted by WGEM-TV in Quincy and will stream live at 7 p.m. on the station\u2019s website, www.wgem.com. Two TV stations in Peoria also will carry it, as will WREX in Rockford.\n\nPritzker announced he\u2019d agreed to Thursday\u2019s debate back in May, months after the initial WBEZ-FM reports about deaths at the veterans home. Now, the debate comes about a week after Democratic Attorney General Lisa Madigan announced an investigation into the Republican administration\u2019s response to the Legionella outbreak.\n\nRauner has called Madigan\u2019s probe a partisan response to a confidential report from Cook County\u2019s top watchdog that concluded Pritzker improperly received $330,000 worth of property tax breaks and tax refunds on one of his Gold Coast mansions as part of a \u201cscheme to defraud\u201d taxpayers.\n\nThe debate also comes one day after the Tribune published stories about how both have released vague and incomplete information about their wealth and have investments in opaque offshore tax havens \u2014 holdings that are more extensive than previously known. Both have declined to provide their entire federal and state income tax returns so that voters might see where the two politicians\u2019 financial interests intersect \u2014 or potentially conflict \u2014 with the business of the state of Illinois.\n\nThe last Rauner vs. Pritzker televised fracas was a bitter duel, and the candidates have since accused each other of criminal activity.\n\nLike that time, Thursday\u2019s debate will feature only Rauner and Pritzker, not Conservative Party candidate Sam McCann and Libertarian Grayson \u201cKash\u201d Jackson. (Mike Riopell)\n\nWhat\u2019s on tap\n\n*Mayor Rahm Emanuel will join former U.S. Education Secretary John King to discuss new University of Chicago research.\n\n*Gov. Rauner and Pritzker will debate in Quincy.\n\n*Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees will hold a downtown news conference to pressure Rauner about state worker pay.\n\n*Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm will speak at an awards event by a abortion rights group Personal PAC.\n\nFrom the notebook\n\n*Dear governor: Most of the state\u2019s Democratic delegation in Congress have sent Rauner a letter to ask that he push for state-level laws meant to counteract the new limits on state and local tax deductions.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that you have failed to oppose this provision of the tax law as it has serious consequences for Illinoisans,\u201d the group wrote. Every Illinois Democrat in the House besides U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski signed the letter.\n\nThe Republican tax plan is a key issue in the race between GOP U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam and Democratic challenger Sean Casten. Roskam has championed the tax overhaul, but Casten has contended that the limit on deductions will hurt suburban homeowners.\n\nAnd the Democratic letter to Rauner puts the delegation into the race for governor, like when Republican House lawmakers last week sent a letter to U.S. Attorney John Lausch about Pritzker\u2019s property tax breaks. (Mike Riopell)\n\nWhat we\u2019re writing\n\n*Rauner and Pritzker want to keep their offshore money a secret. Here\u2019s what we know.\n\n*Where\u2019s Pritzker\u2019s campaign cash coming from? He\u2019s keeping that a secret.\n\n*Rauner\u2019s private foundation has millions invested offshore.\n\n*Gov. Bruce Rauner tries to parse his immigration comments, says he does not believe immigrants are \u2018acting violently.\u2019\n\n*Higher health care costs fuel $700M in new spending under Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle\u2019s $5.9B budget plan.\n\n*Illinois Obamacare exchange rates to decrease next year for many popular plans.\n\n*Emanuel tells reporters: \u2018You\u2019re getting played\u2019 chasing President Trump's tweets.\n\n*In wake of Jason Van Dyke conviction, young activists now seek to oust Chicago aldermen aligned with Emanuel.\n\n*Kushner family selling Chicago office tower.\n\n*University of Illinois at Chicago flourishes amid struggles at state's public universities.\n\n*Regional planning agency says racial inequities holding Chicago back: \u2018We simply can\u2019t afford to keep players on the sidelines.\u2019",

  "text": "Two high-profile conservative activists are lambasting DePaul University after administrators barred them from holding an event on campus, the latest chapter in the school\u2019s turbulent recent history with right-leaning speakers.\n\nCharlie Kirk and Candace Owens of Turning Point USA, a Lemont-based organization that promotes conservatism among high school and college students, tweeted accusations of \u201cfascism\u201d and \u201ccensorship\u201d Tuesday, about three weeks after DePaul notified the group that the talk would not be allowed on campus.\n\nUniversity officials declined to discuss the reasons for the denial, but in a Sept. 17 letter provided by Turning Point, a DePaul administrator cited \u201cconcerns regarding violent language \u2026 as well as identified populations being singled out in a demeaning fashion.\u201d\n\nThat brought a delayed but withering Twitter blast from the would-be speakers.\n\n\u201cThe left hates the idea there are other ideas,\u201d wrote Kirk, 24, a graduate of Wheeling High School. \u201cThey DENIED us because they say we say \u2018potentially violent\u2019 things. Hey DePaul, your fascism is showing.\u201d\n\nThe DePaul event, intended as part of Turning Point\u2019s Campus Clash college tour, is instead scheduled for a downtown Chicago hotel next week.\n\n\u201cBasically, from my point of view, it seems that DePaul has a much stricter process for bringing conservative speakers to campus than it does for people from the left,\u201d said Liam Owen, a junior who is part of the school\u2019s Turning Point chapter.\n\nThat has been a common refrain at DePaul over the past two years, after an appearance by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos ended in a stage invasion and mini-melee. Other speakers, including political commentator Ben Shapiro and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, subsequently weren\u2019t allowed to speak on campus.\n\nThose denials, along with other alleged free speech infringements, earned the school a \u201clifetime censorship award\u201d earlier this year from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group that focuses on college campuses.\n\nAdam Steinbaugh, director of the foundation\u2019s individual rights defense program, said DePaul doesn\u2019t limit its restrictions to conservative speakers: It has also denied official recognition to a student group that favored liberalized marijuana laws, and required the DePaul Socialists to pay for security guards before they could host a guest speaker.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an equal opportunity offender,\u201d Steinbaugh said. \u201cThey just seem to not want to relax their grip on controlling what students say.\u201d\n\nDePaul declined to comment on the foundation\u2019s assessment or Turning Point USA\u2019s criticism. In a statement, a spokeswoman said \u201cthe university will not restrict speech and expression simply because the ideas put forth are controversial.\u201d\n\nThe Turning Point dust-up began when the student chapter requested that Kirk and Owens be allowed to speak on campus. At first, the only problem seemed to be the premature issuing of tickets via the Eventbrite website, said Amy Samuel, the group\u2019s field administrative director.\n\nStudent groups aren\u2019t allowed to publicize events before they get official approval, according to school regulations, and Samuel said Turning Point stopped giving away tickets as soon as DePaul raised that concern.\n\nOther issues weren\u2019t so easily addressed.\n\nA seven-person committee makes recommendations about whether to issue official invitations to visiting speakers. Among the criteria it uses are whether a speaker encourages \u201chatred or physical violence\u201d or \u201chas a history of abuse or intimidation of an identifiable person or community of people\u201d based on race, religion, gender identity and other factors.\n\nGisselle Cervantes, a student member of the committee, said in an email that the biggest problem was the impermissible ticket distribution and marketing of the event.\n\n\u201cThe board never seeks to reject a speaker based on political ideology, and there is no basis for this belief that conservative speakers are not welcome on campus,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Owen said the committee appeared to latch on to a comment made at a Turning Point conference about rhetorical bullets bouncing off conservatives, as well as the general controversy surrounding Candace Owens, a black woman who has equated Democrats with slaveholders, condemned \u201ctoxic feminism\u201d and made other incendiary statements.\n\nDePaul\u2019s rejection letter listed \u201cviolent language\u201d and \u201cidentified populations being singled out in a demeaning fashion\u201d as reasons for the denial, as well as citing the premature advertising. A follow-up letter sent to Turning Point accused the group\u2019s national leadership, rather than DePaul students, of pushing for the event.\n\nOwen said that wasn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cWe filled out the request forms, tried to do everything by the book,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actively tried to cooperate with the university to make sure this went through.\u201d\n\nKirk and Candace Owens\u2019 11-stop campus tour has stirred protest since it began last week at the University of Colorado at Boulder. There, dozens of demonstrators converged in a peaceful rally outside the school\u2019s event center, according to local media.\n\nWhen the duo spoke onstage in Athens, Ga., on Tuesday with Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, they sparred with a group of protesters seated in the hall.\n\n\u201cDo you guys want to walk out now?\u201d Owens taunted, according to a video of the event. \u201cNo? OK. Let us know when you guys need attention.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kirk has continued to promote the Chicago event on Twitter, calling DePaul an \u201cindoctrination campus\u201d and sparking an inspired round of social media jousting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t spout the same tired conspiracies over and over with no actual debate or thought involved,\u201d one critic replied. \u201cThey can just play some random Fox News interview.\u201d\n\nThe event is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday at the JW Marriott Hotel on Adams Street.\n\njkeilman@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @JohnKeilman",

  "text": "A group of young Chicago activists upset over Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s handling of the 2014 Laquan McDonald shooting death announced Wednesday its planned efforts to oust aldermen aligned with the mayor and responsible for passing a broader agenda it says failed the teen and the city.\n\nWhile challengers face an uphill battle against well-funded incumbents, Chicago Neighborhood Alliance founder Kina Collins said last week\u2019s conviction of Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke in McDonald\u2019s death puts a spotlight on how influential groups such as Black Lives Matter have become in the city.\n\n\u201cWith so much to be proud of accomplishing, the large elephant in the room is how we plan to hold the rest of the system accountable,\u201d Collins said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the facts remain, City Hall, the City Council has failed us. On public education reform, they have failed us.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the difficulty of translating street protests to wins at the ballot box, at the City Hall news conference Collins called for young people to find their own races to support in the wards where they live. Though she was joined by more than a dozen candidates for alderman, Collins said it was premature to predict whether her group would announce a slate of specific aldermanic candidates it endorses.\n\nCollins has drawn attention to a handful of African-American aldermen she said have been particularly close to Emanuel. But when asked Wednesday which incumbents she wants to see beaten, Collins said \u201coverall, the City Council as a whole has failed us.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: What lies ahead for Jason Van Dyke \u2014 a complicated sentence, an appeal, a distant jail \u00bb\n\n\u201cCommunities are smart enough to know who should represent them,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut I also know that in the city of Chicago we are up against a very well-oiled political machine, which makes it extremely difficult for those who are qualified constituents to run up against a war chest of millions of dollars that are put out by City Council and put up in political PACs. So I say, \u2018If you feel like you can represent your community, run against the incumbent. They are all up for re-election. Run against them.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEmanuel, who isn\u2019t running for a third term, has pledged to stand by aldermen who\u2019ve supported his programs, noting his slogan from when he was in charge of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee: \u201cNo friend gets left on the field.\u201d\n\nAsked Wednesday about the activists targeting his allies, Emanuel said the City Council has been forced to make tough decisions to stabilize the city\u2019s finances. He did not mention that many aldermen have been on the council for decades and voted for the very policies by his predecessor, Mayor Richard M. Daley, that left Chicago on shaky financial ground.\n\n\u201cI understand that some people may want to talk about becoming aldermen. I think activism, energy is a good thing,\u201d Emanuel said at an event to announce new high-tech police equipment. \u201cBut I know that the aldermen that are here have done the hard work of righting a ship that wasn\u2019t right.

  "text": "Tex Winter, the Hall of Fame coach whose teachings of the triangle offense helped spearhead six Bulls championships in the 1990s, died Wednesday, the Bulls confirmed. Winter, 96, had been in declining health since suffering a debilitating stroke in April 2009.\n\n\u201cI learned so much from Coach Winter,\u201d Michael Jordan said Wednesday night in a statement emailed to the Tribune. \u201cHe was a pioneer and a true student of the game of basketball. His triangle offense was a huge part of our six championships with the Bulls. He was a tireless worker, always focused on details and preparation, and a great teacher. \u2026 I was lucky to play for him.\u201d\n\nIn a statement from the Bulls, executive vice president John Paxson called Winter \u201ca basketball legend and perhaps the finest fundamental teacher in the history of our game.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was an innovator who had high standards for how basketball should be played and approached every day,\u201d said Paxson, who played on the first three title teams. \u201cThose of us who were lucky enough to play for him will always respect his devotion to the game.\u201d\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver released a statement lauding Winter as well.\n\n\u201cLike James Naismith, Tex Winter was an educator at heart who deeply believed in the values of the game of basketball \u2014 teamwork, discipline and selflessness,\u201d Silver said. \u201cA pioneering Hall of Famer with 10 NBA championships, he taught those values to generations of players and coaches, leaving a legacy that will forever be part of our history. We extend our deepest sympathies to Tex\u2019s family and his countless friends and former colleagues.\u201d\n\nJerry Krause hired Winter in July 1985 as one of his first moves as Bulls general manager, and Winter teamed with defensive-minded Johnny Bach to form a potent pairing of assistant coaches for both Doug Collins and Phil Jackson. A noted perfectionist, Winter spent most games scribbling notes to take to the next day\u2019s practice.\n\n\u201cTo him it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Michael Jordan or Keith Booth,\u201d Jackson told the Tribune in a 1998 interview. \u201cIf you don\u2019t play according to the rules of the \u2018basketball gods,\u2019 you are destroying the credibility of the game. Tex thinks there is a way to play the game, and if you don\u2019t abide by those things, then it\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nBorn Morice Fredrick Winter near Wellington, Texas, Winter assisted Jackson on nine NBA championship teams: six with the Bulls and three with the Lakers. His six-decade coaching career also featured 454 victories as a college head coach, mainly at Kansas State but also in stints at Northwestern, Marquette, Washington and Long Beach State. He entered the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nAt Kansas State, Winter guided the Wildcats to four Final Fours, won eight Big Eight championships and was voted national coach of the year for the 1958-59 season. He also went 51-78 as coach of the Houston Rockets from 1972 to \u201974.\n\nBut Winter gained his greatest fame integrating the triangle offense he learned playing for Sam Barry at USC into the NBA, where players such as Jordan and Kobe Bryant learned to revel in its spacing and instinctive reads.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always regarded Tex more as teacher than coach and believe that\u2019s why he had the respect of so many players,\u201d Paxson said in a 2011 interview with the Tribune when Winter entered the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cHe really did approach the practice court as if it were a classroom. Tex was meticulous in having us pay attention to the small details and would drill them religiously. I can honestly say I learned more basketball being around Tex than at any other time.\u201d\n\nWinter loved the triangle offense so much, he would talk about it with anyone, even janitors at the arena. Humble from his roots growing up in West Texas during the Depression years, Winter possessed a self-effacing humor. He would get teased consistently for not letting food go to waste and wearing out-of-date sport coats with pockets typically stuffed with plays drawn on paper.\n\n\u201cThe triangle was predicated on spacing, ball movement, player movement and reading the defense,\u201d Paxson said in 2011. \u201cAnd it was essential to our success. I still remember he would be critical when it came to fundamentals, even with Michael. He used to always say MJ didn\u2019t throw a precise enough chest pass. That\u2019s how he analyzed the game, with an unbelievably educated and well-trained eye.\u201d\n\nIn 1947, Winter was close to accepting a position at Ventura (Calif.) Junior College as an assistant track and basketball coach. He had just graduated from USC, where he was a better pole vaulter than basketball player.\n\nBut Kansas State coach Jack Gardner called Barry, for whom Gardner and Winter had played, and asked for help in finding an assistant. Winter spent 19 seasons in Manhattan, Kan.\n\nWinter was even closer to retiring \u2014 had the car packed and all \u2014 and moving to an Oregon vacation home in 1985 with Nancy, his wife of more than seven decades. But Krause called and practically begged his longtime friend to give him two, maybe three seasons.\n\nWinter stayed 14.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a teacher, first and foremost,\u201d Krause said in 2011. \u201cHe was so critical to our championships. And he gave so much to the game.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Krause once resigned from the Naismith Hall of Fame selection committee because he was so bothered by Winter\u2019s exclusion. Krause didn\u2019t return to the Hall of Fame until 2011, when Winter got inducted and surprised people by pushing through his health issues to attend.",

  "text": "This is our third and final set of endorsements for U.S. House races. You\u2019ll find the candidates\u2019 answers to our surveys, and our endorsements for this election, at chicagotribune.com/candidates.\n\n10th District\n\nWe\u2019ve lamented the lack of competitive U.S. House races in the Chicago area, given Democratic Party dominance. You\u2019ll hear no whining about the north suburban 10th Congressional District, which has toggled between parties in recent election results. The incumbent is Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Deerfield, who sparred three times previously with Republican Robert Dold, winning twice. This time Schneider faces Douglas R. Bennett, a Republican business consultant from Deerfield.\n\nSchneider takes a strategic approach to representing this centrist district, sidestepping progressive overreach. He\u2019s a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which sought a compromise fix for Obamacare. To avert insolvency of Social Security, he would collect more payroll tax by raising the income cap for high earners, and create incentives for people to consider working longer before retirement.\n\nBennett takes a more aggressive stance on entitlement reform. He suggests raising the retirement age for future generations and slowing the growth of benefits to the wealthy. We agree with his approach because the current pace of entitlement spending isn\u2019t sustainable. We\u2019re also with Bennett in support of the tax reform program approved by Congress to ignite job growth and thus generate more tax revenue. Schneider voted against that plan, which is benefiting many 10th District residents and their employers. Bennett endeared himself to us when he noted that Illinoisans are \u201cmoving to Wisconsin and Indiana for the culture and the climate \u2014 the business culture and the tax climate.\u201d\n\nTwo strong candidates; Bennett gets the endorsement.\n\n11th District\n\nWhat a contest: the physicist vs. the cardiologist. Rep. Bill Foster of Naperville, a Democrat representing the west suburban 11th Congressional District, is a physicist. Foster leans liberal but often partners with Republicans. As a scientist, he favors studying the data. Foster\u2019s worked across the aisle on opioid issues, patent improvements and legislation to lift lending restrictions on community banks. He intrigued us with an observation about the health care crisis: Much of the long-term cost increases will be driven by diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease care: \u201cIf we can come up with a low-cost cure for either one of those, that effectively eliminates the long-term fiscal crisis of Medicare.\u201d\n\nThe Republican challenger, Nick Stella, is a cardiologist from Darien who ran for Congress previously. Stella is well-prepared on the issues and understands Obamacare\u2019s shortcomings. Both are solid candidates, but the edge goes to the physicist. Foster is endorsed.\n\n13th District\n\nThere are several U.S. House races in Illinois in which the Republican incumbent is being pressured by a Democrat. One is in the 13th Congressional District, where Rep. Rodney Davis of Taylorville is battling Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield, a first-time candidate who worked as a fundraiser for Sen. Dick Durbin. Davis squeaked to victory in 2012 but coasted to re-election in 2014 and 2016. He\u2019s an infrastructure wonk who knows a key Downstate issue is job creation, which is why he supported Trump\u2019s platform of tax reform and deregulation. We\u2019re with Davis: The country needs to break consistently from its pattern of sluggish 2 percent growth, and tax reform is helping. Dirksen Londrigan said in her Tribune survey that tax reform is \u201cdisastrous\u201d for middle-class and struggling families because they don\u2019t reap enough of the benefits. We think putting people to work is a primary consideration. Davis is endorsed.\n\n15th District\n\nIt\u2019s a long way from southern Illinois to Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain, but Rep. John Shimkus of Collinsville is a leader in the political fight to open a permanent nuclear waste storage site out west. Shimkus, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on the Environment, recognizes that nuclear waste is piling up at less secure temporary sites around the country. That includes Illinois, whose taxpayers must bear the burden. Shimkus is a conservative who works across the aisle on issues such as expanding rural broadband, antibiotic resistance and opioid alternatives. Challenging Shimkus is Kevin Gaither of Charleston, who operates a tutoring business. Shimkus is endorsed.\n\n16th District\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Channahon made some noise last year when House Republicans failed to repeal and replace Obamacare. In a New York Times op-ed, Kinzinger slammed members of the conservative Freedom Caucus for undermining passage by adding new demands. \u201cWe need to find a way to make our healthcare system better,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll gladly walk across the aisle to get the job done.\u201d We value Kinzinger\u2019s independence. A pilot in the Air National Guard, he\u2019s strong on defense and international issues. Democrat Sara Dady of Rockford, an immigration lawyer, believes the fix to health care is \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a government takeover of medical insurance. That\u2019s an unaffordable solution. Kinzinger is endorsed.\n\n17th District",

  "text": "The remnants of Hurricane Michael continued to batter the Southeast, pummeling states with powerful rain, wind and flooding even after being downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nMichael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as a \"potentially catastrophic\" Category 4 storm - the strongest hurricane on record to hit the area - and continued to charge north, wreaking havoc and prompting emergencies. Darkness concealed the full extent of the damage left behind, but a second death was reported early Thursday, apparently caused by debris crashing through a mobile home and killing a child inside.\n\nFEMA Administrator Brock Long said early Thursday that \"search and rescue is where we are hyper-focused this morning\" - particularly in Mexico Beach, Florida, which \"was wiped out\" by Hurricane Michael's storm surge, he said.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do \u2026 there's a lot of debris that we've got to get through,\" Long said on CNN. \"We're trying to get into areas like Mexico Beach, get the teams in to be able to assess damage.\"\n\nLong was asked about Michael's confirmed death toll, which stands at two. \"Those numbers could climb,\" he said. \"Hopefully they don't, but those numbers could climb as search-and-rescue teams get out.\"\n\nThe sun will rise across the Florida Panhandle sometime around 7 on Thursday, and Hurricane Michael's trail of destruction will begin to come into clearer focus. But the early indicators are troubling.\n\nConsider what storm chaser Josh Morgerman tweeted Wednesday night: \"It's hard to convey in words the scale of the catastrophe in Panama City. The whole city looks like a nuke was dropped on it. I'm literally shocked at the scale of the destruction.\"\n\nMorgerman has chased some of the most extreme hurricanes and typhoons across the world. As the Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang noted, \"he is not prone to hyperbole.\"\n\nEarly Thursday, he said that Michael was \"definitely one of the most violent [hurricanes] I've been in.\"\n\nAnother storm chaser, Mark Sudduth, tweeted: \"Drove from Panama City almost to Mexico Beach and I can tell you this is the worst damage from wind that I have ever seen! Absolutely catastrophic! You will not believe your eyes when you see it.\"\n\nAssociated Press Tropical Storm Michael is expected to go through the Carolinas and part of Virginia before heading out to the Atlantic Ocean. Tropical Storm Michael is expected to go through the Carolinas and part of Virginia before heading out to the Atlantic Ocean. (Associated Press) (Associated Press)\n\nSudduth added: \"Walking thru Mexico Beach to receive my GoPro cam and I'm telling you, it's DEVASTATED. Truly devastated. Some buildings completely swept clean - only slabs.\"\n\nMichael weakened as it crossed rain-soaked Georgia and moved northeast toward South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said. By 2 a.m., sustained winds had decreased to 60 mph; at 5 a.m., they had fallen to 50 mph.\n\nHowever, the center said, winds have picked up at certain points along the Georgia and South Carolina coast. Large parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia could still see deadly flash floods today and remain under a tropical storm warning.\n\nThe storm's center is currently about 30 miles west of Augusta, Georgia, near the South Carolina border. Forecasters expect that Michael will continue to weaken Thursday as the storm travels over land, likely reaching central South Carolina Thursday morning. Once Michael reaches the Atlantic, the storm is expected to intensify again as it becomes a post-tropical low.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Apple CEO Tim Cook pledged that the company would help with recovery and relief efforts. \"I grew up on the shores of the Gulf Coast, near Pensacola and Mobile, and that region holds a special place in my heart,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"That's never been more true than now.\"\n\nCook grew up in Robertsdale, Alabama, a city of roughly 5,200 people located roughly halfway between Mobile and Pensacola, Florida. His father worked at Mobile's shipyards, and his mother worked at a drugstore.\n\nThough Cook has called himself a \"a proud son of the South,\" his relationship with the socially conservative community where he grew up is complicated. When Cook came out as gay in 2014, Robertsdale Mayor Charles Murphy suggested that he should have kept his sexual orientation private. \"Tim has done a good job with Apple. We're very proud of the accomplishments that he's made,\" he told Reuters. \"Sometimes people's personal lives need to stay personal.\"\n\nVisiting Robertsdale in 2016, The Washington Post's Todd Frankel noted that Cook's name wasn't on the town's welcome signs, the chamber of commerce brochures, or at his old high school. One former classmate speculated that the lack of recognition might be connected to Cook's advocacy for gay rights.\n\nHigh winds led to the death of an 11-year-old girl in Seminole County, Georgia, EMA Director Travis Brooks told The Washington Post early Thursday morning. The girl had been inside a trailer home in an unincorporated area of the county near Lake Seminole, close to the Florida-Georgia border. From what officials could determine, Brooks said, it looked like a metal carport used to store boats had been lifted in the air by the gusting winds and had flipped over. When it landed, its legs crashed through the roof of a neighboring mobile home and hit the girl in the head.\n\n\"It looked like a war zone,\" Brooks said, adding that it had taken deputies from the Seminole County Sheriff's Office practically all day to get to the mobile home due to the road conditions in the area.\n\nMeanwhile, the Waffle House near Florida State University's campus in Tallahassee was open for business at 12:28 a.m., with lines stretching out the door. FEMA officials famously use the Waffle House Index as a way of measuring storm damage: Since the diner chain is ubiquitous in the southeast, and rarely shuts down in extreme weather, seeing the Waffle House closed down before a storm is a sign that things are about to get extremely bad. If the Waffle House hasn't reopened after the storm, FEMA considers that a sign that the area has experienced major devastation.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a Waffle House spokesman had announced that 30 restaurants in Florida and Georgia were closed in preparation for Hurricane Michael, including locations along the Florida Panhandle from Panama City to Destin. It was a clear warning that the storm should be taken seriously.\n\nImages of the destruction in coastal Florida towns circulated widely Wednesday night, shocking even seasoned storm chasers and weather watchers. Franklin County Sheriff A.J Smith told CNN that the county was nearly isolated after most of the main roads were rendered impassable from flooding and downed trees.\n\n\"It's bad,\" he said. \"We've been through hurricanes but never where we were completely cut off like this.\"",

  "text": "The wine world was shaken, not swirled, when scandal broke out Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn a letter sent out Tuesday, titled \u201cCourt of Master Sommeliers, Americas Board of Directors Takes Unanimous Actions to Preserve Integrity of Examination Process,\u201d the prestigious Court of Master Sommeliers \u2014 the nonprofit governing body of the sommeliers around the world \u2014 said it had invalidated the results of 2018\u2019s tasting portion of the exam. On Sept. 10, the 24 members of the class of 2018 were inducted as master sommeliers, but Tuesday\u2019s news now casts into question the testing system. San Francisco Chronicle wine reporter Esther Mobley first broke the news.\n\nAccording to a release from the court, \u201cThe Board of Directors found sufficient evidence that the tasting portion of the 2018 Master Sommelier Diploma Examination was compromised by the release of detailed information concerning wines in the tasting flight.\u201d SF Chronicle\u2019s report points to an unnamed master sommelier \u2014 who qualified as a Master Sommelier test proctor \u2014 leaking answers to the notoriously difficult tasting portion of the exam to an unnamed candidate of this year\u2019s exams. Of the class of 24, 23 were stripped of their new status \u2014 Morgan Harris, of San Francisco\u2019s The Angler, took the tasting portion last year and was exempt.\n\nThe action strips away the titles of two Chicago-area wine pros \u2014 Dan Pilkey and Jill Zimorski. In the release, Devon Broglie, Master Sommelier and chairman of the board, wrote, \u201cWe are committed to developing an expedited process so that all eligible candidates can retake the tasting examination.\u201d\n\nShortly after ostensibly passing his Master Sommelier exam, Pilkey posted on Facebook a breakdown of his 15-year journey to the Master Sommelier test, beginning in 2003. According to his post, it took him eight years to get the coveted MS pin. For many sommeliers, climbing the ranks of the Court of Master Sommeliers means better paying jobs, career growth, respect of peers and much more. Invalidating the honor seems like wiping away years of hard work and training.\n\nMovies like \u201cSomm\u201d (the third in the series has just been released) brought increased attention to restaurant and wine culture, with sommeliers ascending the cultural zietgiest as so-called rock stars of the wine world. The film called it the \u201chardest test you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d but the news of cheating among the ranks calls into question the last few years of testing. Though the Court of Master Sommeliers, which has named just 274 master sommeliers since 1969, wrote that the \u201cBoard of Directors has barred the Master involved from participating in any Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas programs or events and has voted unanimously to initiate the process of terminating membership pursuant to the organization\u2019s bylaws,\u201d it\u2019s unclear if other breaches of test integrity exist. The move to invalidate September\u2019s certification is, as noted by the court\u2019s release, an attempt to maintain the integrity of the exams.\n\nThis story will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\njbhernandez@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @joeybear85\n\nMORE COVERAGE",

  "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-social-security-checks-increase-cola-20181011-story.html#nt=oft06a-2li2",
  "text": "Tens of millions of Social Security recipients and other retirees will get a 2.8 percent increase in benefits next year as inflation edges higher. For the average retired worker, it amounts to $39 a month.\n\nAfter a period of low inflation, the increase for 2019 is the highest in 7 years.\n\nThe cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, affects household budgets for about one in five Americans, including Social Security beneficiaries, disabled veterans and federal retirees. That's about 70 million people, enough to send ripples through the economy.\n\nAutomatic inflation protection has been a standard feature of Social Security since 1975. Social Security recipients also gain from compounding because COLAs becomes part of their underlying benefit, the base for future COLA increases.\n\nNonetheless many retirees and their advocates say the Social Security COLA is too meager and doesn't reflect higher health care costs for older people. Federal budget hawks take the opposite view, arguing that annual increases should be smaller to reflect consumers' penny-pinching responses when costs go up.\n\nWith the COLA, the estimated average monthly Social Security payment for a retired worker will be $1,461 a month next year. Other Social Security beneficiaries include disabled workers and surviving spouses and children. Low-income disabled and elderly people receiving Supplemental Security Income also get a COLA.\n\nRetiree Danette Deakin, of Bolivar, Missouri, says she feels as though her cost-of-living adjustment is already earmarked for rising expenses. Her Medigap insurance for costs not covered by Medicare is going up, and so is her prescription drug plan. She expects her Medicare Part B premium for outpatient care will also increase, although the government hasn't released that yet.\n\n\"It isn't enough of an increase that it takes care of all of the increases from health care, plus rent \u2014 our rent gets increased every year,\" said Deakin, 70, who worked in the finance department at a boat dealership.\n\nHealth care costs eat up about one-third of her income, she estimated.\n\n\"I appreciate the COLA adjustment, and in no way am I complaining,\" Deakin added. \"It's just that every single thing you can talk about goes up. It doesn't go down.\"\n\nBy law, the COLA is based on a broad index of consumer prices calculated by the government. Advocates for seniors claim the general index doesn't accurately capture the rising prices they face, especially for health care and housing. They would like the government to switch to an index that reflects the spending patterns of older people.\n\n\"What the COLA should be based on is still a very real issue,\" said William Arnone, CEO of the National Academy of Social Insurance, a research organization not involved in lobbying. \"Older people spend their money in categories that are going up at a higher rate than overall inflation.\"\n\nThe COLA is now based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W, which measures price changes for food, housing, clothing, transportation, energy, medical care, recreation and education.\n\nAdvocates for the elderly would prefer the CPI-E, an experimental measure from the government that reflects costs for households headed by a person age 62 or older. It usually outpaces general inflation, though not always.\n\nCOLAs can be small or zero, as was the case in several recent years. People often blame the president when that happens. However, the White House can't dictate the COLA, which is determined by nonpolitical experts. If there were to be any revisions, President Donald Trump would have to persuade Congress to change the underlying law.\n\nTrump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Social Security or Medicare. But the government is running $1 trillion deficits, partly as a result of the Republican tax-cut bill the president claims as one of his main achievements. Mounting deficits will revive pressure to cut Social Security, advocates for the elderly fear.\n\n\"The revenue loss in the tax bill contributes to much higher deficits and debt, and that is where the threats begin to come in,\" said David Certner, policy director for AARP. \"Social Security, and in particular the COLAs, have been the target.\"\n\nBeyond federal budget woes, Social Security faces its own long-term financial problems and won't be able to pay full benefits starting in 2034.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama floated \u2014 but ultimately dropped \u2014 a proposal called chained CPI, which would have slowed annual COLAs to reflect penny-pinching behavior by consumers. The idea behind it is that when the price of a particular good or service rises, people often respond by switching to a lower-cost alternative.\n\nBecause of compounding, smaller COLAs would have a dramatic effect over time on the federal budget and Social Security finances. But if inflation continues to rise, proposals to scale back cost-of-living adjustments carry greater political risk.\n\nSocial Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on wages, with half paid by workers and the other half paid by employers. Next year, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax will increase from $128,400 to $132,900.\n\nAbout 177 million workers pay Social Security taxes. Of those, nearly 12 million workers will pay more in taxes because of the increase in taxable wages, according to the Social Security Administration.",

  "text": "The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered an operation to lure Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia and then detain him, according to U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan.\n\nThe intelligence, described by U.S. officials familiar with it, is another piece of evidence implicating the Saudi regime in Khashoggi's disappearance last week after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials say that a Saudi security team lay in wait for the journalist and killed him.\n\nKhashoggi was a prominent critic of the Saudi government and Mohammed in particular. Several of Khashoggi's friends said that over the past four months, senior Saudi officials close to the crown prince had called Khashoggi to offer him protection, and even a high-level job working for the government, if he returned to his home country.\n\nKhashoggi, however, was skeptical of the offers. He told one friend that the Saudi government would never make good on its promises not to harm him.\n\n\"He said: 'Are you kidding? I don't trust them one bit,' \" said Khaled Saffuri, an Arab American political activist, recounting a conversation he had with Khashoggi in May, moments after Khashoggi had received a call from Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to the royal court.\n\nThe intelligence pointing to a plan to detain Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia has fueled speculation by officials and analysts in multiple countries that what transpired at the consulate was a backup plan to capture Khashoggi that may have gone wrong.\n\nA former U.S. intelligence official - who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter - noted that the details of the operation, which involved sending two teams totaling 15 men, in two private aircraft arriving and departing Turkey at different times, bore the hallmarks of a \"rendition,\" in which someone is extralegally removed from one country and deposited for interrogation in another.\n\nJeenah Moon / Bloomberg Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speaks in New York on March 27, 2018. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speaks in New York on March 27, 2018. (Jeenah Moon / Bloomberg) (Jeenah Moon / Bloomberg)\n\nBut Turkish officials have concluded that whatever the intent of the operation, Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate. Investigators have not found his body, but Turkish officials have released video surveillance footage of Khashoggi entering the consulate on the afternoon of Oct. 2. There is no footage that shows him leaving, they said.\n\nThe intelligence about Saudi Arabia's earlier plans to detain Khashoggi have raised questions about whether the Trump administration should have warned the journalist that he might be in danger.\n\nIntelligence agencies have a \"duty to warn\" people who might be kidnapped, seriously injured or killed, according to a directive signed in 2015. The obligation applies regardless of whether the person is a U.S. citizen. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident.\n\n\"Duty to warn applies if harm is intended toward an individual,\" said a former senior intelligence official. But that duty also depends on whether the intelligence clearly indicated Khashoggi was in danger, the former official said.\n\n\"Capturing him, which could have been interpreted as arresting him, would not have triggered a duty-to-warn obligation,\" the former official said. \"If something in the reported intercept indicated that violence was planned, then, yes, he should have been warned.\"\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the warning process, declined to comment on whether Khashoggi had been contacted.\n\nAdministration officials have not commented on the intelligence reports that showed a Saudi plan to lure Khashoggi.\n\n\"Though I cannot comment on intelligence matters, I can say definitively the United States had no advance knowledge of [Khashoggi's] disappearance,\" deputy State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters Wednesday. Asked whether the U.S. government would have had a duty to warn Khashoggi if it possessed information that he was in jeopardy, Palladino declined to answer what he called a \"hypothetical question.\"\n\nIt was not clear to officials with knowledge of the intelligence whether the Saudis discussed harming Khashoggi as part of the plan to detain him in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut the intelligence had been disseminated throughout the U.S. government and contained in reports that are routinely available to people working on U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia or related issues, one U.S. official said.\n\nThe intelligence poses a political problem for the Trump administration because it implicates Mohammed, who is particularly close to Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton spoke by phone with the crown prince, but White House officials said the Saudis provided little information.\n\nTrump has grown frustrated, two officials said, after initially reacting slowly to Khashoggi's disappearance. Earlier this week, he said he had no information about what had happened to the journalist.\n\nWhite House officials have begun discussing how to force Saudi Arabia to provide answers and what punishment could be meted out if the government there is found responsible.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have reacted harshly to the disappearance. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators asked Trump to impose sanctions on anyone found responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance, including Saudi leaders.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., perhaps the president's closest ally in the Senate, predicated a \"bipartisan tsunami\" of action if the Saudis were involved and said that Khashoggi's death could alter the nature of relations between the two countries.\n\nKushner's relationship with Mohammed, known within national security agencies by the initials MBS, has long been the subject of suspicion by some American intelligence officials.\n\nKushner and Mohammed have had private, one-on-one phone calls that were not always set up through normal channels so the conversations could be memorialized and Kushner could be properly briefed.\n\nFor all his criticism of the Saudi regime, Khashoggi was not always opposed to Mohammed's policies. Khashoggi credited the young leader for what he saw as positive changes, including loosening Saudi cultural restrictions.",

  "text": "Warner Saunders took an unconventional route to the top anchor chair at one of Chicago\u2019s major network affiliate stations, spending his early career as a schoolteacher and then as the executive director of a nonprofit group aimed at improving opportunities for African-American children on the West Side.\n\nHe got into broadcasting full time as head of the community affairs department at WBBM-Ch. 2, where he hosted the station\u2019s \u201cCommon Ground\u201d public affairs show. He moved to WMAQ-Ch. 5 in 1980, already in his mid-40s, and worked his way up from weekend news anchor to become a sports anchor and then to co-anchor the 10 p.m. weekday news.\n\n\u201cWarner was a gentle giant,\u201d said Channel 5 meteorologist Brant Miller. \u201cHe always carried himself with poise and he was the person you could turn to in the newsroom who always sat back, pondered the situation and had a sense of wisdom.\u201d\n\nSaunders, 83, died Tuesday night after he collapsed and was taken to Illinois Masonic Hospital, according to a statement issued by NBC 5. He had been a Lincoln Park resident.\n\nSaunders grew up in the South Side Bronzeville neighborhood and graduated in 1953 from Corpus Christi High School in Chicago, where he was the teen club president, ran on the track team and worked on the school\u2019s yearbook. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in health and physical education in 1957 from Xavier University in New Orleans, where he played football and basketball.\n\nSaunders became a youth worker and a teacher in the Chicago Public Schools before being appointed executive director of the Better Boys Foundation in the West Side Lawndale neighborhood in 1963. The group had been organized in 1961 to encourage members of juvenile gangs to meet peacefully for recreational activities and counseling.\n\nThe job gave Saunders elevated visibility in Chicago, and he made a name for himself by fighting for jobs and better housing in the Lawndale community. In 1968, he was tapped to co-host \u201cFor Blacks Only,\u201d a weekly series on WBKB-Ch. 7, which now is WLS-Ch. 7, alongside radio star Holmes \u201cDaddy-O\u201d Daylie. The show aired for about two years, and Saunders also began hosting monthly specials on Channel 5 as well.\n\nIn 1970, Saunders began anchoring a late-night, 30-minute newscast on fledgling WSNS-Ch. 44, where he was also the part-time urban affairs editor, while continuing his work for the Better Boys Foundation. He also found time to earn a master\u2019s degree in 1972 from Northeastern Illinois University\u2019s Center for Inner City Studies.\n\nIn 1974, Saunders joined Channel 2 and drew raves \u2014 and local Emmy awards \u2014 for his work hosting the station\u2019s \u201cCommon Ground\u201d program, where guests included civil rights luminaries including Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson, as well as Dick Gregory and Eartha Kitt.\n\nPHOTOS: Chicago notable deaths in 2018 \u00bb\n\nPHOTOS: Notable deaths in U.S., World in 2018 \u00bb\n\n\u201cHe had street cred,\u201d said former Channel 2 news anchor Bill Kurtis, who worked alongside Saunders in the 1970s. \u201cHe had been there \u2014 he came up during the civil rights movement, had played some basketball and moved into broadcasting and fit like a glove. He had good integrity, and good talent, and (viewers) trusted him when he told stories about Chicago, especially. I had a great deal of respect for him.\u201d\n\n\u201c(People) come to us for intellectual stimulation, and that\u2019s what they get,\u201d Saunders told the Tribune in 1977.\n\nSaunders hosted a local Emmy-winning, one-hour documentary in 1979, \u201cThe End of the Line.\u201d With producer Scott Craig and writer Clarence Page, now a Tribune columnist, Saunders concluded that problems like broken families and terrible schools had worsened in the previous decade, painting an even bleaker picture for youth in Chicago.\n\nIn 1980, Saunders jumped to Channel 5, where he began anchoring the news on weekends. He reprised his work on gangs with a special that he co-reported with Carol Marin, titled \u201cGangs: The New Chicago Mob?\u201d which aired in 1981.\n\nIn November 1982, Saunders gave up his news anchor seat to shift to becoming Channel 5\u2019s weekday early news sports anchor. In 1989, Saunders shifted back to anchoring the news, this time as the weekday early evening news co-anchor. In 1997, upon the departure of Ron Magers and Carol Marin from NBC 5, Saunders assumed the role of the 10 p.m. news co-anchor, alongside Allison Rosati.\n\n\u201cWarner was a giant in our newsroom,\u201d the station's vice president of news, Frank Whittaker, said in a statement. \u201cSo many of us relied on his advice and counsel as we covered stories each day. Viewers trusted him. He was genuine Chicago. We\u2019ve lost a big part of our history today.\u201d\n\nSaunders was off the air for a time in 2002 during a bout with cancer. He also had other health issues that kept him off the air for long stretches in the fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009. Veteran Chicago broadcaster Bob Sirott filled in for him during those stretches and briefly succeeded Saunders as Channel 5\u2019s 10 p.m. anchor after Saunders retired.\n\n\u201cHe was very wise about the business, and the reason that people felt close to him was not only would he give you great advice about work, but he was really a student of life and someone who was very good about advising people on the things that mattered most in life, and most of the time that was not work,\u201d Sirott said. \u201cHe was a spiritual guy, and you could get on a level with him that was very sort of raw, and he was a good shrink for people. And with him, there was never any static \u2014 he was always supportive, always friendly and always helpful. He never got into a lot of the office craziness or gossip.\u201d\n\nBefore retiring in 2009, Saunders had conducted diversity seminars part time. In retirement, he did more of that work.\n\n\u201cI am very anxious to pursue my passion \u2014 diversity education,\u201d Saunders told the Tribune in 2008.\n\nSurvivors include Saunders\u2019 wife, Sadako; and a son, Warner Jr.\n\nService information was not available.\n\nGoldsborough is a freelance reporter.",

  "text": "Devastated by his divorce and stunned by the attack on Pearl Harbor, auto mechanic Harry Carlsen climbed into his car and headed west to Los Angeles, where he enlisted in the Marines.\n\nLess than two years after the attack on Dec. 7, 1941, Tech. Sgt. Harry \u201cBud\u201d Carlsen, 31, a native of suburban Brookfield, died in November 1943 during the Battle of Tarawa in the Pacific theater of World War II.\n\nHis remains, along with those of 549 other Marines killed in the battle, were not identified or recovered for decades.\n\nOn Wednesday, nearly 75 years after his death, Carlsen finally returned home.\n\n\u201cWhen his name would come up at family parties, my grandmother always got very quiet, as Harry was her brother, and even years later it was still very painful,\u201d said Ed Spellman, a great-nephew of Carlsen.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Spellman gathered with members of his family and veterans from the area at O\u2019Hare International Airport to greet the arrival of Carlsen\u2019s remains with a hero\u2019s welcome.\n\nMore than 76 years after Pearl Harbor, Fox Valley sailor finally laid to rest \u00bb\n\nPearl Harbor sailor's homecoming, burial leads his descendants to discover cousins they never knew they had \u00bb\n\nFamily photo Marine Tech. Sgt. Harry \u201cBud\u201d Carlsen, a Brookfield native, will be laid to rest at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood nearly 75 years after his death in the Pacific. Marine Tech. Sgt. Harry \u201cBud\u201d Carlsen, a Brookfield native, will be laid to rest at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood nearly 75 years after his death in the Pacific. (Family photo)\n\nHis casket was accompanied by the Patriot Guard Riders as it traveled to a funeral home in Arlington Heights, where a wake will be held later this week.\n\n\u201cWe all would have preferred he had lived, but for our family, that was not one of the outcomes of the war,\u201d Spellman said. \u201cWe all just kept hoping we would find him someday.\u201d\n\nThe mission that eventually would unravel the mystery surrounding Carlsen\u2019s remains did not begin until decades after the Marine was killed in action Nov. 20, 1943 \u2014 the first day of the Battle of Tarawa on the small island of Betio.\n\nCarlsen was among the Marines and sailors who encountered formidable Japanese resistance as they attempted to secure the island over several days of intense fighting, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency website.\n\nAbout 1,000 U.S. military personnel were killed and more than 2,000 were wounded during the three-day battle that left the Japanese \u201cvirtually annihilated,\u201d officials said.\n\nOf the 16 million Americans who served in World War II, more than 400,000 died. By the war\u2019s end, 79,000 Americans who lost their lives were unaccounted for, officials said; more than 72,000 of them remain unaccounted for today.\n\nEfforts to identify Carlsen after his death included a search of family records and letters written by his mother, Amalia Carlsen, to the U.S. government, questioning the whereabouts of her son\u2019s remains and when they might be returned home, Spellman said.\n\n\u2018An astonishing piece of luck,\u2019 as long-lost WWII dog tag is traced back to Chicago man \u00bb\n\nMarker honors former World War II airfield site at Vernon Hills High School \u00bb\n\n\u201cThe government wrote back in a letter from 1947 that they were sorry, but they did not have them,\u201d Spellman said.\n\nIn the wake of the Battle of Tarawa, U.S. service members who died in the fight were buried in a number of battlefield cemeteries on the island, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. During remains recovery operations in 1946 and 1947, Carlsen\u2019s remains were among those that were not identified, agency officials said.\n\nEven though the Marine\u2019s dog tags were removed, his gravesite was ravaged and records were lost, the family learned that Carlsen\u2019s unidentified remains were moved to a mausoleum in Hawaii in 1946 and reinterred in 1949 at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Hawaii\u2019s Punchbowl in grave E1212.\n\nNearly six decades later, Carlsen\u2019s niece, Nancy Spellman, who is Ed Spellman\u2019s mother, was looking for a hobby to occupy her time after moving from Arlington Heights to Marco Island, Fla., upon her retirement, Ed Spellman said.\n\n\u201cWe had bought her a computer, which she didn\u2019t know how to use, but she figured it out,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was troubled that we still knew nothing about what happened to her uncle\u2019s remains, so she started to reach out to people online at military chat sites.\u201d\n\nNancy Spellman was often frustrated as her efforts were stymied by what her son described as \u201cbureaucratic red tape\u201d as she sought answers from the U.S. government, Ed Spellman said.\n\nBut she was encouraged by three private researchers who confirmed that Carlsen\u2019s remains were likely found among those in grave E1212. The family then found a supporter in U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski.\n\nIn 2009, the Democrat from Western Springs called for renewed efforts to bring home the remains of the more than 500 U.S. service members who, like Carlsen, were killed in the Battle of Tarawa.\n\n\u201cI wanted the Department of Defense to do more about returning the remains of the servicemen killed in this battle, with the goal of returning 200 remains (from all branches of the military) every year,\u201d Lipinski said.\n\nWhen Lipinski heard from Carlsen\u2019s family, he recalled, \u201cThey had private organizations that had done some great research, but unfortunately, the government agency in charge was having a lot of internal problems at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame it took so long, but I\u2019m glad we were able to help this family finally have some closure after all of these years,\u201d the congressman added.\n\nEncouraged by Lipinski\u2019s initiative in 2009 and his support in Congress, Nancy Spellman shipped a DNA sample to Quantico, Va., hopeful that government officials would act to exhume the remains.\n\n\u201cAt that point, my mother was ill with cancer, and she told me she still hoped that someday, we would find him,\u201d Ed Spellman said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re dealing with a government agency, things happen painfully slow.\u201d\n\nSpellman said he rarely checks voicemail messages on the landline in his family home in St. Charles, so when he discovered an urgent message in July from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, he was flabbergasted.\n\n\u201cThe call came out of the blue, and when I talked to them, they told me they had made a positive identification to my uncle with the DNA sample we had sent them,\u201d Spellman said. \u201cIt pretty much knocked me over.\u201d",

  "text": "Treasure Island Foods stores closed Wednesday afternoon, officially ending a 55-year run in Chicago.\n\nThe Gold Coast store on Elm Street was the last of the six remaining stores to close, a store employee said. High Ridge Partners, the liquidation firm managing the company\u2019s assets, confirmed that all of the stores were closed.\n\nTreasure Island delivered the news of its imminent closing to its employees on Sept. 28 and 29, saying all stores would close by Oct. 12. Many of the chain\u2019s employees say they weren\u2019t given enough notice under state and federal law and are still owed pay and benefits.\n\nLast week, Treasure Island filed notice with the state that it was laying off 486 workers. The document filed with the state didn\u2019t specify why the company failed to give the workers 60 days\u2019 notice, as is typically required for mass layoffs by state and federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification acts.\n\nA spokesman for the Illinois Department of Labor said Tuesday that the agency was not investigating the lack of 60-day notice because no formal complaints had been filed with the state.\n\nAttorneys for Treasure Island wouldn\u2019t answer questions on the matter Tuesday after a court hearing.\n\nTwo lawsuits are pending. Longtime produce wholesaler Anthony Marano Co. sued Treasure Island last week over more than $450,000 in allegedly unpaid produce. Recent court filings indicate Treasure Island owes $900,000 in total to its produce vendors. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 28 employees, also filed a lawsuit against Treasure Island last week, for allegedly violating a federal law that governs layoff notices.\n\ngtrotter@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @GregTrotterTrib\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\nTreasure Island workers protest loss of wages, health benefits \u00bb\n\nProduce wholesaler sues soon-to-close Treasure Island Foods, alleges $453K in unpaid fruits and veggies \u00bb\n\nUnion sues Treasure Island Foods, alleges closing grocer failed to give enough notice before layoffs \u00bb\n\nCommentary: Treasure Island is closing.

  "text": "The president of the College of DuPage, who helped lead the school out of a series of scandals that occurred during her predecessor\u2019s tenure, has announced her resignation.\n\nAnn Rondeau, a retired vice admiral in the U.S. Navy, will leave the west suburban college in December to become president of the Naval Postgraduate School in California, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer announced Wednesday.\n\nRondeau took over as COD\u2019s sixth president in 2016 following a period of turmoil at the state\u2019s largest community college that culminated in the firing of her predecessor, Robert Breuder, and the school being placed on probation by the agency that accredited it.\n\nThose developments occurred after a series of Tribune investigations revealed questionable spending and lax financial oversight.\n\nThe Higher Learning Commission removed the school from probation last year and allowed it to keep its accreditation after saying the college, under Rondeau\u2019s leadership, had adequately reversed its lack of compliance with the commission\u2019s criteria for institutional integrity and effective governance.\n\nA statement COD issued Wednesday credited Rondeau with helping to create initiatives aimed at promoting regional business growth, job creation and on-the-job skills-building partnerships.\n\n\u201cI am deeply humbled that I assume this extraordinary honor and privilege of continued leadership service,\u201d Rondeau said in a prepared statement. \u201cI have so much respect, affection and affinity for our College of DuPage community and our District 502 residents. We are a remarkable place and we have remarkable people working with dedication in the honorable and diligent mission of teaching and learning.\u201d\n\nPrior to joining COD, Rondeau was a consultant with IBM Watson Group and president of the National Defense University. And she previously was commander of the Naval Service Training Command at Naval Station Great Lakes in Lake County.\n\nRondeau was initially hired by COD in 2016 with a one-year contract with a base salary of $325,000.\n\nThe college\u2019s board of trustees will discuss plans to name an interim president at their next meeting Tuesday.",

  "text": "When it comes to their money, Republican Bruce Rauner and Democrat J.B. Pritzker operate from the same financial playbook often used by the super rich, one that relies heavily on secrecy.\n\nBoth candidates for governor have released vague and incomplete information about their wealth. Both have declined to provide their entire federal and state income tax returns so that voters might see where the two politicians\u2019 financial interests intersect \u2014 or potentially conflict \u2014 with the business of the state of Illinois. And both have investments in opaque offshore tax havens \u2014 holdings that are more extensive than previously known, the Tribune has found.\n\nRauner and Pritzker have investments registered at the Ugland House, a five-story building in Grand Cayman that thousands of companies use as their address to minimize taxes. As he sought to crack down on offshore tax havens in 2009, President Barack Obama called the place either \u201cthe largest building in the world or the largest tax scam in the world.\u201d\n\nDaniel Berman, a former deputy international tax counsel for the U.S. Treasury Department, said places like the Cayman Islands are known for secrecy, lax regulations and little or no taxes. He said that does not mean people are breaking the law, noting that avoiding taxes \u2014 as opposed to evading them \u2014 is a fully legal tax behavior.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 tax returns could provide voters a fuller explanation of how Pritzker and Rauner use offshore financial strategies to avoid taxes and hide assets from public scrutiny as they seek to occupy the Governor\u2019s Mansion and make decisions about spending and how much others will pay in taxes.\n\nREAD MORE: Democrat J.B. Pritzker has poured a record $146 million into his Illinois governor campaign. He won't provide details on where the money is coming from. \u00bb\n\nREAD MORE: Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has criticized J.B. Pritzker for offshore investments but has millions of dollars invested offshore himself. \u00bb\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the case that every investment in the Cayman Islands is abusive,\u201d Berman said. \u201cIt can be a legitimate business in the Cayman Islands, if you report income and assets and are complying with the tax law. Of course, they won\u2019t show their full tax returns, so we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nPritzker and Rauner are the wealthiest individuals to ever seek the governor\u2019s office in Illinois. If elected, Pritzker would become the nation\u2019s richest governor, eclipsing Tennessee Gov. William Haslam. Forbes last week pegged Pritzker\u2019s wealth at $3.2 billion, while Haslam, whose family owns the Pilot Flying J truck stop chain, is worth an estimated $1.8 billion.\n\nRauner did not make the magazine\u2019s list of the world\u2019s billionaires. In 2014, he told the Tribune he\u2019s worth at least $500 million. Last month, Rauner declined to reveal a specific number, saying his net worth is \u201cless than one-third\u201d of Pritzker\u2019s.\n\nThe Tribune sent detailed questions to both campaigns. Neither Pritzker nor Rauner would directly answer questions about their fortunes, nor would either say how much he was worth. Instead, both campaigns issued responses attempting to distance their respective candidate from offshore investments.\n\n\u201cGov. Rauner has already gone far beyond what is required regarding his tax filings and statement of economic interests,\u201d Rauner campaign spokesman Will Allison said. \u201cBeyond that, all of the governor's investments are in blind trust procedures and he would not be able to discuss with specificity the details of those investments.\u201d\n\nPritzker benefits from trusts that were established years ago, campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen said.\n\n\u201cJ.B. is occasionally listed on documents related to the foreign trusts because he has a beneficial interest in the trusts, but he has no role, does not make decisions, or receive distributions from the foreign trusts,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts say investing offshore typically gives no tax advantages to U.S. investors like Rauner and Pritzker. Income from offshore investments is still subject to U.S. taxes, but investing offshore is secretive and conceals the nature of the investments.\n\nSome of that is done at Ugland House, the Grand Cayman building that\u2019s the listed address for about 18,000 companies and investment funds. None of the companies registered there are physically housed in the building. Maple and Calder, an international law firm with clients around the world, is the building\u2019s sole tenant. The firm has said Ugland House has been unfairly criticized by the media and politicians who do not fully understand offshore investing.\n\nSteven Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., said funds are set up in places like the Cayman Islands to attract foreign investors and tax-exempt U.S. investors such as pension funds and university endowments.\n\nTypically, investments are handled through partnerships, and one would need to see the detailed tax schedules for Rauner and Pritzker to better understand their financial ties to offshore investments, Rosenthal said.\n\nRauner and Pritzker each have released the first two summary pages of their tax returns, but have declined to release the lengthy schedules that would provide greater detail about their capital gains, dividends, deductions and business partnerships.\n\nIn reporting on the candidates\u2019 finances, the Tribune obtained some records about Pritzker\u2019s and Rauner\u2019s offshore interests through a reporting partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which maintains a database of millions of leaked financial records collectively known as the Paradise Papers. The bulk of the Paradise Papers, which were first obtained by the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, come from Appleby, a century-old law firm that provides legal services to large corporations and wealthy individuals.",

During the previous three years, he has reported earning $28 million.\n\nSo where\u2019s all the campaign cash coming from? The billionaire Gold Coast Democrat wants to keep that a secret.\n\nPritzker, who is one of the richest men in the U.S., declined to reveal how many domestic and offshore family trusts he benefits from. He won\u2019t identify the trusts by name or where they\u2019re located. And he declined to say how much money he receives from them.\n\nThe Tribune has found that Pritzker\u2019s offshore investments are more extensive than previously known, with money parked in at least 12 investment funds in the Cayman Islands. Those investments are in addition to his offshore shell companies revealed in a March Tribune report that prompted Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner to accuse Pritzker of \u201ctax dodging on a massive scale.\u201d\n\nPritzker declined requests to be interviewed. His campaign asked for questions in writing but did not directly answer any of the 36 inquiries the Tribune submitted.\n\nInstead, a campaign aide released a six-paragraph response that reiterated a statement from November 2017 that Pritzker\u2019s trusts have paid tens of millions of dollars in state and federal taxes. The campaign released no documents to back up that claim and did not respond to requests to release his trusts\u2019 state and federal tax returns.\n\nPritzker has disclosed the financial assets he personally holds, as well as those held by trusts in which he benefits, said Pritzker campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen.\n\n\u201cJ.B. has his own investments and receives disbursements from certain trusts as well as having his own personal savings,\u201d Slayen wrote in an email.\n\nUnless Pritzker reveals more about where his money comes from ahead of the Nov. 6 statewide election, voters will head to the polls not knowing where his financial interests might intersect with state government.\n\nREAD MORE: Rauner and Pritzker want to keep their offshore money a secret.

Pritzker, however, has declined to provide specifics about his tax plan.\n\n\u201cThe wealthier you are, the more incumbent it is on you to be transparent, to release complete tax returns,\u201d said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based securities lawyer. \u201cThe potential conflicts are much more material simply because the more money you have, the greater the potential to favor a particular industry or a tax change that benefits you.\u201d\n\nFamily money\n\nPritzker, 53, was born into a wealthy family notorious for secrecy when it comes to its finances. According to Forbes, he is worth an estimated $3.5 billion, with several relatives also making the magazine\u2019s list of billionaires.\n\nThe family\u2019s wealth was methodically built up over the decades by J.B. Pritzker\u2019s ancestors. Nicholas Pritzker, an immigrant who fled the pogroms in Ukraine, arrived in Chicago in the late 19th century and began practicing law.\n\nA few decades later, his son and eventual family patriarch, Abram \u201cA.N.\u201d Pritzker, began to amass a broad portfolio of real estate and corporate holdings. He piloted the family\u2019s growing business interests, and along the way set up numerous offshore trusts for the benefit of the family.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Pritkzers bought an airport hotel in Los Angeles called the Hyatt, and from that single hotel, the family built a sprawling global hotel chain. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s late father, Donald, was a co-founder, chief executive and driving force in the Hyatt chain. Besides hotels, other business interests included cruise ships, tobacco, insurance, banking and casino gambling.\n\nAfter A.N. Pritzker died in 1986, the family\u2019s solidarity began to wobble. The IRS ramped up its accusations that the family was hiding assets offshore to avoid paying taxes, settling the case in 1994. Eight years later, two of J.B. Pritzker\u2019s cousins sued the family, alleging their trusts had been looted of hundreds of millions of dollars by older relatives.\n\nThe suit, largely hashed out in closed courtrooms and sealed documents, was settled in 2005. The family proceeded with a secret agreement to divide up its $15 billion fortune. The once-monolithic family had splintered into factions, with individual heirs taking control of their own finances.\n\nJose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune Democratic candidate J.B. Pritzker has disclosed little about the sources of the nearly $150 million in personal wealth he has put into his campaign for governor. Democratic candidate J.B. Pritzker has disclosed little about the sources of the nearly $150 million in personal wealth he has put into his campaign for governor. (Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune)\n\nOffshore interests\n\nJ.B. Pritzker founded a private investment firm with his older brother, Anthony. The Pritzker Group began to take off in size and scope by the late 2000s. Pritzker stepped away from the firm to run for governor.\n\nAs required by state law, Pritzker filed a statement of economic interests, which lists more than 300 entities he has a financial stake in but not the dollar amount invested. Pritzker revealed that he owned stock in a number of iconic companies such as Anheuser-Busch, Disney, Procter & Gamble, Facebook and Apple, as well as a number of lesser-known companies.\n\nPritzker also disclosed a single trust that he\u2019s a beneficiary of and controls. He declined to release any tax returns for PG Byk Trust, although that information would provide a fuller, more accurate picture of his immense wealth and where it might conflict with the state\u2019s interests.\n\nNor has Pritzker released information about any offshore family trusts he benefits from.\n\nVoters had more information the last time Pritzker ran for office 20 years ago. As part of an unsuccessful congressional bid, Pritzker disclosed income from 26 family trusts, according to a 1997 Sun-Times story. Pritzker reported that roughly half of his 1996 income came from those trusts, according to the financial disclosure statements he filed then. That federal form, which was more detailed than the version Pritzker filled out to run for governor, is no longer publicly available.",

  "text": "Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner repeatedly has ripped Democrat J.B. Pritzker for his extensive secret offshore dealings, sounding the campaign theme on social media, at political fundraisers and in speeches.\n\n\u201cA man who inherits billions of dollars but hides it in offshore bank accounts in the Bahamas to avoid paying taxes will not work to give you the tax relief that you deserve,\u201d Rauner told supporters last month.\n\nWhat Rauner doesn\u2019t talk about are his own offshore dealings before and after he became governor. As with Pritzker, a lack of disclosure about his finances helps keep such details hidden.\n\nThe Tribune, piecing together a variety of records, has found that Rauner\u2019s private foundation has invested in a Cayman Islands fund after he became governor, he has personal investments in at least three offshore funds and his former private equity firm once was considered a \u201ctop client\u201d of a major law firm that provides offshore legal services.\n\nHow much money the governor has invested offshore remains unclear, except for the $10 million stake the Rauner Family Foundation has in Roundtable Hedge (Carleon) Offshore fund, according to the nonprofit organization\u2019s 2016 tax forms and the General Registry of the Cayman Islands.\n\nRauner previously has dismissed criticism of his offshore holdings, saying they are not as extensive as those of Pritzker and he has \u201cno control of the decision-making.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to his foundation, who made the decision to invest offshore is murky.\n\nREAD MORE: Rauner and Pritzker want to keep their offshore money a secret. Here's what we know. \u00bb\n\nREAD MORE: Democrat J.B. Pritzker has poured a record $146 million into his Illinois governor campaign. He won't provide details on where the money is coming from. \u00bb\n\nInitially, a campaign aide said the governor and wife Diana Rauner control the foundation\u2019s investments. \u201cYes, it\u2019s under their control. That includes making decisions about donating money to charities and making decisions about investments,\u201d Rauner campaign spokesman Will Allison said in an interview.\n\nAsked later how the governor\u2019s foundation came to invest in the offshore fund, Allison said he had misspoken earlier. He said the foundation\u2019s investments actually are handled through the same arm\u2019s-length procedures that have governed Rauner\u2019s personal finances.\n\nAs he took office in 2015, Rauner set up a power of attorney to handle much of his wealth to try to avoid conflicts between his personal investments and his public duties. He gave that power to Roundtable Investment Partners, a New York firm.\n\nWhen it comes to the Rauner Family Foundation, however, documents examined by the Tribune call into question the Rauner campaign\u2019s assertion that Roundtable Investment Partners is guiding its financial strategy. The foundation\u2019s most recently filed tax forms show the organization\u2019s books are \u201cin the care of\u201d Diana Rauner, who also is listed as vice president, secretary and treasurer.\n\nThe foundation lists J.P. Morgan Chase as its investment adviser in 2015, paying the company nearly $100,000 that year, Rauner\u2019s first as governor. No investment adviser is listed on the foundation\u2019s most recent tax filing, which covers 2016. The Rauners\u2019 foundation has not filed its 2017 tax forms and has asked for an extension until mid-November, shortly after the election.\n\nNeither Diana Rauner nor Roundtable could be reached for comment. The campaign did not explain why Roundtable Investment Partners is not listed as the investment adviser on the foundation\u2019s two most recent tax forms. Roundtable oversees the Cayman Islands-registered fund that the Rauners\u2019 foundation now has a healthy stake in.\n\nE. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune Gov.

Bruce Rauner, shown Oct. 8, 2018, at the Columbus Day Parade in Chicago, is seeking a second term in November. (E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune)\n\nAfter a recent appearance before the Tribune Editorial Board, Rauner \u2014 who is listed as president of the family foundation \u2014 said \u201cthe Roundtable guys\u201d control the foundation\u2019s investments. Asked if he could provide a document showing that, Rauner said he did not know.\n\nThe governor and the private equity firm are intertwined both financially and politically. Rauner is an investor in the Roundtable firm and several of its funds. And Roundtable employees have donated nearly $90,000 to his campaign fund, according to state campaign finance records.\n\nRauner has disclosed an investment in the Roundtable Hedge offshore fund on his statements of economic interests. The form requires the governor to list what he has a financial interest in but does not require that he say how much money is invested.\n\nDocuments also show that Rauner has investments related to his personal wealth in three other Cayman Islands funds. Those offshore investments were made in a Lime Rock Partners energy fund; a fund from BDT Capital Partners, which is run by Winnetka\u2019s Byron Trott, who has given $230,300 to Rauner\u2019s campaign; and a fund from the Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR. Rauner was the longtime chairman of GTCR \u2014 the \u201cR\u201d is for Rauner \u2014 before running for governor.\n\nREAD MORE: Lawsuit Rauner fought to keep sealed alleges $15 million return 'apparently is not enough' \u00bb\n\nBoth the GTCR fund and the Lime Rock fund are registered at the Ugland House in Grand Cayman, the listed address for thousands of companies and investment funds. Former President Barack Obama once criticized the place as a tax haven. Pritzker, who Forbes magazine estimates is worth $3.2 billion, has at least four investment funds registered at Ugland House.\n\nIn addition, GTCR is listed as a \u201ctop client\u201d for the financial year 2013 by Appleby, a century-old offshore law firm that provides legal services to large corporations and wealthy individuals. That designation from Appleby was contained in the Paradise Papers \u2014 a set of millions of leaked offshore financial records, many of which came from Appleby, where the motto is, \u201cThe right people.

  "text": "In life, we play many roles but there is one principal role that we share in common \u2013 to be the best human being possible. If prime importance is given to this role, then we will excel in the play of our other roles. Examine the life of Krishna. We find that he played every role to perfection\u2013 the role of a cowherd with his little friends, the role of a mischievous son, the part of a warrior, a king and even the role of charioteer. Can you imagine the controller of the whole universe tending horses, washing them, putting all the dung into a dung pit?\n\n\n\nHe did this to demonstrate that we must each be ready to play the role \u2018assigned\u2019 to us without any complaints. Observe the quality of the mind, when we have performed sincerely and given our best with no ulterior motives.\n\n\n\nIn every stage of life, each one has various roles to play. However, at any given point of time, we have to focus on the role that is predominant under the given circumstances. For example, while at work in a corporate office, the predominant role is of an employee; other roles are secondary. If one lets the role of a husband, father or friend interfere with the role as an employee, one will not be able to do full justice to it. The attention will be divided and the performance will at best be mediocre.\n\n\n\nMaintain constant vigil, give priority to the role that the situation demands and also ensure that there is no intermixing of roles. This will guarantee that we give total attention to the task in hand, work to the best of our ability and maximise our potential. All else should be of no consequence at that time. The art of being aware of our thoughts and giving single-pointed attention to the role at hand, leads to increased levels of concentration.\n\n\n\nEach role comes with its own set of duties. While playing the role of a student, we must appreciate that the primary duty of a student is to work hard and excel in studies, maintain good health and ensure a conducive, learning atmosphere. In the role of a housewife, it is the duty of the lady, to care for the welfare of every family member and do the best by each one. Simultaneously, the homemaker must maintain her own physical as well as emotional wellbeing.\n\n\n\nThus, to avoid their intermingling, each one needs to master the technique of constant vigil, while playing the diverse roles presented at any given time. This will not happen in one day. A practice of continuous alertness towards the flow of thoughts while performing the action is required. Other distracting thoughts should be restrained from entering the mind. In the absence of alertness, an unsuspecting mind will entertain unnecessary thoughts from all directions. This will drastically affect the performance and reduce it to average or substandard levels.\n\n\n\nFor stability, peace and harmony to prevail, it is crucial to channelise one\u2019s energy towards constructive actions. It is essential to distinguish between constructive enabling actions and negative actions. Negative thoughts and actions which create instability, disturbance, disharmony need to be eliminated. To elevate the mind, it is vital and extremely important to follow these guidelines. The author is from Chinmaya Mission, Delhi.",

  "text": "Loneliness is like a gap, it hurts, while \u2018aloneness\u2019 means you are complete, says OSHO, responding to a seeker\u2019s question\n\nOne of the greatest hurdles we face is to be alone: to stand alone in the face of the opinions of the world, in the face of the lies of the world, to be able to be physically alone and, ultimately, to be alone without even our minds, is it not?\n\nOsho: The darkness of loneliness cannot be fought directly. It is something essential for everyone to understand; that there are a few fundamental things which cannot be changed. This is one of the fundamentals. You cannot fight with darkness directly, with loneliness directly, with the fear of isolation directly. The reason is that all these things do not exist; they are simply absences of something, just as darkness is the absence of light.\n\nNow what do you do when you want the room not to be dark? You don\u2019t do anything directly with darkness \u2014 or do you? You cannot push it out. There is no possible way to make some arrangement so that the darkness disappears. You have to do something with light. Now that changes the whole situation, and that\u2019s what I call one of the essentials, fundamentals. You don\u2019t even touch the darkness, you don\u2019t think about it. So just bring in light and you will not find darkness at all, because it was the absence of light. Loneliness is similar to darkness. You have not experienced your aloneness and its beauty, its tremendous power. In the dictionaries, loneliness and aloneness are synonymous, but existence does not follow your dictionaries \u2014 and yet nobody has ever tried to make an existential dictionary which will not be contradictory to existence.\n\nOn the one hand, you are clinging to something which is not real, which is just a temporary arrangement \u2014 a relationship, a friendship. And while you are in the relationship you can create a little illusion to forget your loneliness. But this is the problem: although you can forget your loneliness for a moment, just the next moment you suddenly become aware that the relationship or the friendship is nothing permanent. The illusion gives a certain solace, but it cannot create the reality so that all fear disappears. It represses the fear, so on the surface you feel good \u2014 at least you pretend to feel good to yourself. But behind the illusion \u2014 and the illusion is so thin that you can see behind it \u2014 there is pain in the heart because the heart knows perfectly well that tomorrow things may not be the same.\n\nOSHOSPEAK\n\n1. You cannot fight the darkness of loneliness or fear of isolation directly, because they don\u2019t exist\n\n2. You try to beat loneliness by way of relationships and friendships, but they too are temporary\n\n3. Aloneness simply means completeness. You are whole; there is no need of anybody else\n\nSociety has tried to make arrangements so that you can forget loneliness. Arranged marriages are just an effort for you to know that your wife is with you. All religions resist divorce for the simple reason that if divorce is allowed, then the basic purpose marriage was invented for is destroyed.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that every effort that has been directed toward avoiding loneliness has failed, and will fail, because it is against the fundamentals of life. What is needed is not something in which you can forget your loneliness. What is needed is that you become aware of your aloneness, which is a reality. And it is so beautiful to experience it, to feel it, because it is your freedom from the crowd, from the other. It is your freedom from the fear of being lonely.\n\nJust the word \u2018lonely\u2019 immediately reminds you that it is like a wound: something is needed to fill it. It is a gap and it hurts. The word \u2018aloneness\u2019 does not have the same sense of a wound, of a gap that has to be filled. Aloneness simply means completeness. You are whole; there is no need of anybody else to complete you.\n\nSo try to find your innermost centre where you are always alone, have always been alone. In life, in death, wherever you are, you will be alone. But it is so full, it is not empty. It is so full and so complete and so overflowing with all the juices of life, with all the beauties and benedictions of existence that once you have tasted your aloneness, the pain in the heart will disappear. Instead, a new rhythm of tremendous sweetness, peace, joy, bliss, will be there.\n\nIt does not mean that a man who is centred in his aloneness, complete in himself, cannot make friends. In fact, only he can make friends, because now it is no longer a need, it is just sharing. He has too much; he can share.

  "text": "We need to experience the energy of existence by opening our inner doors and stepping out, writes PRATIKSHA APURV\n\nWhile walking around Hallstatt, a small village in Upper Austria, the clear blue and white skyline, and the lush green trail leading to the mountains, remind me of the grace and grandeur of all that we call life. I stop by the lake in deep silence and feel the overflowing energy of existence, joyously enraptured in its own play, with no purpose and nowhere to go.\n\nIt\u2019s a divine cosmic play, ever existing with no inherent purpose, other than its own playing. As the gentle sunlight and the soothing breeze caress my skin, and a group of white clouds glides by smiling at me, joyfully humming their beautiful song, I stand there captivated. I see and feel all these in the wonder-filled moments of silence and awe.\n\nThis vibrant but subtle energy of nature is present everywhere since eternity \u2014 be it the Alps or the Himalayas. However, not everyone gets to experience it. That is because either we are not yet ready, or we have closed our doors and windows, unable to embrace and meld into this beautiful, blissful cosmic energy.\n\nPerhaps we are so engrossed in listening to the rumblings of our own mind that we are missing this beautiful energy that enwraps us. We end up missing the invitation to become like them \u2014 the breeze, the flora and fauna and the serene and beautiful skyline.\n\nTo allow this cosmic energy to flow within us, and for communion to happen, the inner doors will have to be opened. The Bhagwad Gita says: \u2018Brahmarpanam brahma havir brahmagnau brahmana hutam, brahmaiva tena gantavyam brahma-karma-samadhina\u2019. Through this shloka, Krishna explains in simple words that it is easy to see the signs of existence, the eternal Atman, Brahmn, by surrendering oneself to the ever present cosmic energy.\n\nYajna is God, Brahmn offering as oblation is God, and the sacred fire of yajna is also God. This whole existence is within God himself. Imagine a seeker sitting in meditation at dawn, and as the sun rises, he absorbs the sunrays, symbolising communion with the cosmos, with existence itself. For this communion to happen, we need to become one by giving up our thinking process and becoming a little more receptive.\n\nAfter all, this cosmic energy can only be lived and experienced; one cannot think about it. The moment thinking disappears, the cage, our prison, is also gone. One simply flies into the very core of existence, the inner sanctum of one\u2019s true self. It is only in such a state that one can communicate with nature \u2014 with birds, flowers, sunlight, and with all-round existence present everywhere.\n\nWALKING AROUND HALLSTATT IN AUSTRIA, NATURE\u2019S PAINTED BLUE AND WHITE SKYLINE AND THE BEAUTIFUL TRAIL LEADING TO THE MOUNTAINS REMINDED ME OF THE GRACE AND GRANDEUR OF ALL THAT WE CALL LIFE\n\nThis phenomenon is depicted in the painting \u2018Cosmic Energy\u2019. Meditation is the quality of our being and is as natural as breathing. Just as in our conversations, we talk about breathing air, similarly, by being totally absorbed in cosmic energy, we can breathe consciousness, and that is why our ancient scriptures say that everything present in the cosmos is in a state of meditativeness including flowers and trees; in fact the whole of life is absorbed in deep meditation. We only need to open our inner doors and allow the waves of consciousness to enter this ocean of meditation.\n\nIt has also been beautifully described in Taittiriya Upanishad: \u2018Pranam deva anu prananti, manushya pashvashchye, panam hi bhutanamayu, tasmatsarvayushmuchyate\u2019 \u2014 \u2018The gods live through prana and so do man and other beings. Prana truly is the life of all beings and is, therefore, also called cosmic life.\u2019\n\nAccording to Osho, once receptivity for cosmic energy arises, one realises there is no purpose to life and we exist as a play. He said: \u201cTo me, everything is just a play. Neither I am, nor is there any purpose, yet things are going on. So it can be asked,\u2018 Why are they going on?\u2019They are going on because there is no purpose to stop them, and there is no one to stop them. It is in their nature to go, move, play, and overflow. It is the very nature of cosmic energy to exist, to be conscious of this existence, and to play with itself.\u201d\n\nOne has to move into the cosmos through meditation and stop thinking where it leads. Existence is waiting with millions of doors open for us, but we are standing outside, merely thinking or interpreting this play of cosmic energy. One has to experience this energy of existence by opening our inner doors and stepping out. One has to dive deep into it to ensure that there is no coming back of the old self. A kind of harmony is then born between the seeker and the cosmos.\n\nSince there is no mind and no thoughts, ego also disappears. Once the ego is gone, one is in a deep state of surrender, a quality that we also refer to as \u2018surrender\u2019 to the cosmic energy that brings transformation \u2014 a subtle change within our consciousness. Then there is no separation from existence; there is no gap or division, which for long has been created by us, by our own conditioning.\n\nThe Presence\n\nThen one can taste what Kabir and Nanak had tasted \u2014 cosmic presence in everything. When Kabir attained this state, his disciples went up to him and requested him to stop weaving and offered their services to him. Kabir laughed at such a proposition saying that his weaving is not just about clothes, which is just an outer act, but simultaneously, it affirmed what goes inside him while weaving, which is a pure meditative space and a oneness with existence, overflowing with cosmic energy.\n\nThrough meditation this pure cosmic energy is offering the very seeds of godliness. One can see and feel that the role of our mind is being reduced and eventually replaced by an awareness that is filled with tremendous harmony, benediction and love in each and every moment. There would be no thought ripples in our consciousness, just as I am experiencing, while standing on the panoramic bridge at Hallstatt, a vast silence engulfs me and I am no more. Time stands still. O what a benediction it is!\n\nOne can call this moment godliness or call it a state of moksha-nirvana or whatsoever one likes to call it. As Osho says: \u201cNot for a single moment can you exist separate from the universe. It is there, and it is there as an experience. You are in it and it is in you\u201d.\n\nDramatic Landscape\n\nThe hamlet of Hallstatt in Upper Austria is located between mountains on Lake Hallstatt. The village landscape is one of visual drama with huge mountains rising abruptly from narrow valleys. Archeological discoveries in the Salzburg Valley, situated above the town of Hallstatt, has revealed signs of human habitation as far back as 2000 BCE. Thanks to the salt mining industry, the region has enjoyed economic prosperity since ancient times.\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad\n\nThe Taittiriya Upanishad is divided into three chapters and 32 sections. The first chapter, Shikhshavalli, deals with education of students and their responsibilities after graduation. The second chapter, Brahmandavalli, focuses on the theme of Atman and asserts that knowing one\u2019s Self is the path to freedom from all concerns and fears. The third chapter, Bhriguvalli, deals with an enquiry of Brahmn by sage Bhrigu in a conversation with his father Varuna.",

  "text": "Are you using the mind or being used by the mind? Are you a slave to the mind or master of the mind? As a college student, you must establish mastery over your mind. Mind is useful so long as you use it wisely.\n\nBut first, what is mind? It is a bundle of thoughts. If thoughts are used wisely, they will be valuable tools, both in your studies and in business. But thoughts that are mechanical, automatic and compulsive are only stumbling blocks. You are studying, but if your thoughts go gallivanting, there is no point staying with your books, is there? Whenever you are free, empty your mind of thoughts and you will find yourself relaxing. In this relaxed state of being, you are in control of your mind, and such a state will be beneficial for your studies.\n\nFor example, sleep is useful but if you are over sleeping, then sleep is an obstacle. Similarly, mind is useful, but if you are not the master, then such a mind is an obstacle. How to develop mastery over the mind? Whenever you are not pressed for time or work, turn your attention to your respiratory process. Feel your exhalation and inhalation, your breath going out and coming in. Slowly train your mind to be in the present. Life is lived in the present, and mind is lost if it dwells either in the past or in the future. It takes training to keep the mind in the present state. Observe your breath. Be aware of the quantity of the air that is inhaled and exhaled. Feel the temperature of the air that is inhaled and exhaled. Sharpen your awareness. Then you will find that the mind is in the present\u2026.\n\nWhenever you see an object through your eyes, it is not the eyes that see it. Something other than the eyes is making the eyes see. Understand this clearly. The mind behind the eyes facilitates, enables, and influences the perceptual act of seeing. Therein lies the importance of the mind. If the mind is not disciplined, even your visual perception will be flawed. An unhappy mind dwells on unhappy things, and implicates unhappiness to everything its owner sees. Even the dreams will be clouded in unhappiness.\n\nUnderstanding this over-riding effect of mind over perception will help you in training the mind to exert its influence in desired directions. This will help in your commitment to train the mind by seeing how it influences your overall behaviour.\n\nNow make a conscious, deliberate decision to stay happy under all circumstances without any specific reason. Let not reason imprison you. Go beyond the manipulations of your mind that says, \u201cIf things happen this way, I will be happy, otherwise, I won\u2019t.\u201d When you walk, feel the minute signs of vitality flowing through millions of cells in different parts of your body. When you look at your surroundings, feel the way your eyes drink in joy from the charms of nature. When you are taking a bath, give yourself up to the sensuous exuberance of water droplets soaking through your skin. Over time, your mind will learn to endow every experience with an exhilarating touch of beauty, joy and well-being. Then the mind will develop taste buds to feel happy without the manipulation of reason.",

  "text": "When the state government of Odisha identified and deregistered 137 Bangladeshi nationals from the electoral rolls this month, it marked a turning point. The last time the state took concrete action on illegal immigrants was a quarter century ago under late Chief Minister Biju Patnaik.\n\nWhat makes this especially noteworthy is the state\u2019s different demographics in comparison to those states where illegal immigration has been a hot button issue, and what this might portend.\n\nThe issue is nearing a climax in Assam, with the ongoing implementation of the long-pending National Register of Citizens (NRC), and its associated disputes. Demands are being made for similar exercises in other states, notably by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for the state of Bengal.\n\nUnlike Assam and Bengal, Odisha\u2019s share of all minorities in its population is far lower, with a 2011 census figure of 6%. Nevertheless, Odisha too has had its share of controversies about changing demographics. These have included disputes about conversions by Christian missionaries as well as Hindu ones, occasionally leading to violence. The murders of Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two children in 1999, and Swami Laxmanananda in 2008 (and the dozens who died in the riots that followed) remain gruesome testaments.\n\nIn recent years, the narrative of a massive influx of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants into India has taken hold. Though the Union government admits there are no verifiable figures, it estimates there are 20 million of them in India. They are said to constitute a significant percentage of all construction workers, as well as household help.\n\nSimilarly, Odisha has been abuzz with reports of a sharp growth of illegal immigrants. They are concentrated in the coastal district of Kendrapada, which I represented in the Lok Sabha. It is on the Bay of Bengal, across from Bangladesh on a stretch of sea frequented by fishing boats. With efforts by many \u2013 including my repeated interventions in Parliament \u2013 a Coast Guard aerial reconnaissance unit has been set up in Odisha, as well as a few \u201cmarine police stations\u201d in the coastal districts.\n\nThough the state government claims Odisha has fewer than 4,000 illegal Bangladeshis, most people believe the number is many times higher, based on anecdotal evidence. Like most states, Odisha had taken illegal immigration lightly, and been unenthusiastic about implementing even Supreme Court rulings to identify and deport. So why has it woken up now?\n\nThe answer is politics. In a campaign speech last weekend, BJP president Amit Shah explicitly asserted what had long been expected to be a key part of his strategy for the next general elections: the identification and deportation of illegal immigrants. To consolidate its vote base, the party seems to be doubling down on its appeal to nationalism. And that is probably paying off, for nothing else explains Odisha shaking off its torpor with this sudden call to action.\n\nOne of the chief reasons for decades of nationwide sloth on this subject was that it had been successfully converted into a \u201csecular\u201d issue. But it was an open secret that many such immigrants gradually acquired ration cards and other forms of local identification with the connivance of local leaders, and ultimately enrolment on electoral rolls.\n\nSeveral political parties and commentators to the left of centre continue to dispute this widely accepted scenario. But their argument that \u201ccommunalists\u201d have simply victimised Indian Muslims by terming them Bangladeshis is so far not backed by evidence. The reported anomalies in the Assam NRC don\u2019t count, since it is still work in progress, with provisions for rectification, and in any case is under SC scrutiny.\n\nApart from Union government estimates, statistics support the likelihood of large scale illegal immigration over a long period. For instance, in the first three decades after independence, Assam registered a population growth 50% higher than the national average, indicating in-migration. That is corroborated by the subsequent demographic changes.\n\nThe BJP seems keen to shun a \u201ccommunal\u201d tag, and has been trying to distance itself from such execrable phenomena as cow vigilantism, even as it redoubles efforts on the \u201cnationalism\u201d front. The latter is its \u201csecular\u201d path to rallying the base and even expanding its vote share. But its opponents are determined to sully that effort. On the immigrants\u2019 issue, apart from the NRC kerfuffle, they point to the Modi government\u2019s Citizenship Amendment Bill, easing restrictions on non-Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\n\nAt first glance, the bill may indeed appear communal, and some in the opposition are calling it a violation of the Constitution\u2019s clause 14 on the right to equality. But, in fact, the concept of providing safe haven to religious minorities fleeing persecution from neighbouring countries, as distinct from non-persecuted groups seeking economic opportunities, is well accepted. Though the non-inclusion of persecuted Ahmadis of Pakistan, and Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar, will need to be debated, there is nothing fundamentally communal in the bill.\n\nGlobally, decades of laissez faire attitudes to illegal immigrants are collapsing under voter anger, and India is no exception. Of course, in states that have experienced dramatic demographic changes, old style \u201csecular\u201d parties may still profit from being soft on illegal immigration. But the turnaround in Odisha, with still largely unaltered demographics, may indicate a tipping point in national attitudes.",

  "text": "In an important judgment yesterday, Supreme Court has wisely refrained from disqualifying those charged by courts from elected office. Criminalisation of politics accompanied by rising influence of money and muscle power pose a fundamental threat to democracy. But half-baked and drastic solutions like disqualifying those charged by courts as sought by the petitioners are not the answer.\n\nThe framing of charges by a court is just an intermediate stage in criminal law procedure between the filing of chargesheet by police and commencement of trial. Conviction or acquittal follows a rigorous process of examining prosecution and defence witnesses and evidence during trial. In contrast, framing charges require judges to merely take a prima facie view of the chargesheet and supporting/ opposing arguments to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to put a person on trial. But the slow pace of trials in India and the influence commanded by politicians conspire to give MPs and MLAs a long rope.\n\nThis could explain why SC on Tuesday issued directions requiring candidates and their parties to declare criminal cases and give due publicity to criminal records. Unfortunately, the tactic of shaming politicians and parties to reveal criminal records hasn\u2019t had much success in changing voter perception. But civil society groups have scraped valuable data from election affidavits revealing the extent of criminalisation of politics. SC\u2019s 2013 Lily Thomas judgment striking down a provision protecting convicted lawmakers from immediate disqualification was a key moment in the fight. That was a critical judgment which disqualified convicts like Lalu Prasad Yadav and VK Sasikala.\n\nHaving passed the full legal process till conviction there was no room for these leaders to cry foul. In contrast, disqualifying at the inconclusive stage of framing charges will lead to bias and political witch hunts. Fast tracking cases against politicians is the best solution available. In Delhi, local police stands exposed after AAP MLAs were discharged or acquitted in 20 of 23 cases by special fast track courts set up to try cases against MPs and MLAs. ADR\u2019s analysis of election affidavits reveal nearly one-third of India\u2019s MPs/ MLAs declared criminal cases. Fast tracking the serious cases to conviction, acquittal, discharge or closure will clean up the Augean stables.",

  "text": "The trade war between US and China has escalated over the last few days in a series of retaliatory tariffs. Chances of resolution are ebbing away as the trade war is a symptom of a larger strategic competition between the two countries. Collateral damage from this friction is being felt by the multilateral WTO, which is tottering as neither of the two economic behemoths is likely to pay heed to its judgments if it doesn\u2019t suit them. In this situation an emerging market such as India can only wait it out, while being nimble and flexible enough to spot opportunities in this churn. India must also use this phase to enhance the efficacy of its domestic economic architecture.\n\nThe last four years have been tough on India\u2019s merchandise exporters, who have suffered an erosion in their competitiveness. The only durable solution to their problems is an acceleration of and more integrated approach to domestic reforms. Moreover, the fallout of the trade war between US and China provides a country like India opportunities which didn\u2019t exist a few months ago. As US and EU companies with a large manufacturing base in China seek to de-risk their operations by shifting some of it out, India must be in the game. So far, it\u2019s the more nimble Vietnam and other southeast Asian nations which have cornered benefits.\n\nEven China\u2019s selective escalation of tariffs provide opportunities for Indian businesses. These need to be grabbed. Simultaneously, we need to work on long-term competitiveness. The ongoing exercise to operationalise a national logistics plan, for instance, must be seen through if the stated aim of bringing down logistics costs to below 10% of GDP from the current level of 14% is to be met. Regardless of the trade regime that evolves over the next few years, it is the more efficient economies that will corner opportunities. India needs to gear up for this phase.",

  "url": "https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/surgical-strikes-better-for-surgeon-than-the-patient/",
  "text": "To combat severe spinal arthritis, I underwent major surgery on my back last year. The surgeon reconstructed three vertebrae using titanium rods. Alas, one and a half years later the pain is almost as bad as before. On every post-operation visit, he takes an X-ray of my back. He looks admiringly at his handiwork, almost as though he is in love with it. \u201cIt looks really good,\u201d he says.\n\nSorry, I say, but the operation was supposed to end my spinal pain, and it hasn\u2019t done so. Don\u2019t worry, the X-ray shows you are doing fine, you will get better in due course, says the surgeon, giving the X-ray another admiring gaze. This operation has left the surgeon delighted, without curing the patient.\n\nI was reminded strongly of my own sad story when the government decided to celebrate September 29 as \u2018Surgical Strike Day\u2019, on the second anniversary of its strikes on terrorist camps across the border. The University Grants Commission instructed all colleges to celebrate too. It seems that Surgical Strike Day may become a hardy annual.\n\nIn 2016, rising violence in Kashmir by Islamic militants culminated in attacks on Indian forces at Uri and Pathankot. This stoked public anger, and Narendra Modi\u2019s strongman image was at stake. His party had always claimed to be the most patriotic and ultra-nationalist, the most committed to get tough with enemies. So, to retaliate against Uri and Pathankot, Indian troops were sent on September 29 that year across the Line of Control in Kashmir to hit various terrorist camps. The government called it a \u201csurgical strike\u201d. It created much elation in political circles and the media about having taught Pakistan a lesson.\n\nTwo years later, we must ask, what was the impact of the strike on Pakistani and militant activity? Did it solve or greatly mitigate India\u2019s problem? The answer is disconcerting. Sandeep Bharadwaj of the Centre for Policy Research estimates that in Kashmir, the number of insurgency-related fatalities went up from 267 in 2016 to 358 in 2017. The number of estimated infiltrations went up from 371 to 406. And the number of civilian deaths increased by 166%.\n\nTwo years on: Killings in Kashmir have risen as has\n\nborder violence, but strikes did make Indians feel good\n\nPakistani support for militants remained undiminished. Border violence also worsened. India-Pakistan ceasefire violations more than doubled in 2017 compared with 2016. And Pakistan has just elected a new prime minister, Imran Khan, who has long been cozy with both the militants and the Pakistan Army.\n\nIn sum, India is no more secure than before. Yet the government keeps crowing about how fabulous the surgical strike was, and how well it was executed. This reminds me of my own back surgeon. He too crows about how beautifully he did the operation, and how wonderful the X-rays look. In the case of both my back and Kashmir, the operation has done more for the surgeon than the patient.\n\nThe surgical strike in 2016 was short and swift, a hit-and-return tactic. It was a shallow penetration, no more than one kilometre into enemy territory, killing and wounding a modest number of militants. Pakistan\u2019s first reaction was to say it was unaware of anything more than the usual border incidents. Later it admitted, and independent foreign journalists confirmed, that the strikes were real. But they said they resembled a mosquito bite more than surgery. Pakistan declared that it would not be cowed by such tactics and warned India not to trifle with a first-strike nuclear power. Violence in Kashmir continued unabated.\n\nThe surgical strike was mostly political theatre. It made most Indians feel good, without greatly disturbing Pakistanis. Such an outcome has its uses.\n\nMany Indians have long called for really tough retaliation against Pakistan, such as aerial bombing of terrorist camps across the border. However, Pakistan will not take this lying down and will retaliate, maybe by sending its own bombers into action. This could lead to dangerous escalation between two nuclear-armed countries. That should be avoided.\n\nSurgical strikes may be political theatre, but that is far better than armed escalation. The Indian public has long wanted to teach Pakistan a lesson for supporting militant attacks. After Uri and Pathankot, something had to be done. The surgical strikes constituted a limited operation, doing enough damage to satisfy the domestic audience, without being heavy enough to stoke dangerous retaliatory escalation.\n\nThis is not a solution to the Kashmir problem. But it is a useful way of assuaging the Indian public and thwarting armed escalation. Whether it should be celebrated annually is another matter.\n\nPS: I don\u2019t celebrate the anniversary of my back surgery. It\u2019s not even political theatre.",

  "text": "Empress. Goddess. Barbie doll. Bride. Her chin is so slim. Her face has a lovely melon seed shape. She\u2019s doe eyed. Bai fu mei, beautifully fair skinned. Also Fan Ye, an address usually reserved for men of power and authority.\n\nThese are just some of the terms of intimacy actress Fan Bingbing enjoys with her fans in China, where she has been a household name this entire century, with over 60 million followers on Weibo where Chinese superstars totally outshine Western ones. Bingbing is disadvantaged in Hollywood because she isn\u2019t fluent in English. This same language barrier also means that Hollywood artists are handicapped among Chinese fans.\n\nGlobal audiences know Bingbing through hit or miss Hollywood appearances, like in the X-Men film where she plays a teleporting mutant, aptly named Blink. And as a fashion icon. Endorsement deals with luxury brands keep her swimming in striking couture. She wows year after year at Cannes. Her red carpet appearances are jaw dropping.\n\nBut since July her global recognition has spiked spectacularly. She disappeared. The world was aghast that this could happen to someone who has topped the Forbes list of China\u2019s celebrity earners for four consecutive years. Evidently it\u2019s not just minority Uighurs who are getting disappeared. There is indeed a crackdown on both \u201ctigers\u201d and \u201cflies\u201d.\n\nHer vanishing was ascribed to tax evasion, which regularly gets actors into trouble from LA to Paris to Mumbai but never in as hair-raising a dematerialisation. This month the drama escalated as Interpol chief Meng Hongwei went missing even while Bingbing resurfaced on Weibo, with an abject apology to the Communist Party and a pledge to spread \u201cpositive energy to society\u201d.\n\nHongwei is accused of taking bribes but the official statement on his detention also cites the need for an \u201cabsolute loyal political character\u201d. Bingbing will evade arrest if she pays an epic fine but comparably, she has gotten zero points in a report assessing Chinese celebrities for social responsibility. It\u2019s perplexing. When Aamir Khan spoke of having discussed moving out of India with his wife, he got heavily trolled and labelled anti-national. Bingbing however has stirred up no such storm. She has lined up to sing \u201csocialist core values\u201d obediently.\n\nBelieving the song of course requires a bit of a magic trick. Or something like the dimension-warping portals that Blink creates to teleport people and objects. A-list actors\u2019 fees have soared in line with the Chinese box office readying to overtake the American one. It\u2019s the flash, bling and cha-ching of this staggering wealth that actually feeds back into their cult super-stardom. In fact the questions \u201ccore values\u201d fans seem most interested in are, who is Bingbing dating \u2013 not a rich man she says cause she\u2019s a rich woman, thank you very much; and how she maintains her perfect complexion \u2013 don\u2019t touch caffeine, use two sheet masks a day, wear sunscreen even in front of the computer screen.\n\nBingbing says her parents\u2019 dreams of artistic careers got buried by Mao\u2019s cultural revolution. She likes to boast about how she rose in the entertainment industry without guanxi, or connections. There\u2019s powerful personal branding to how she says in the De Beers advertisement, women today are very powerful, they take control of their work and careers. Can a new cultural revolution torpedo such careers?\n\nIt\u2019s an unequal fight. TV shows like Studying Xi in the New Era and Marx Got It Right are trying hard. Short films on \u201csocialist core values\u201d are playing before movie screenings. But that ship has sailed. They can\u2019t vaccinate against the cocktail of consumerism, individualism, hyper creativity and social media. Xinhua has been railing against \u201csickly aesthetics\u201d where makeup-laden, androgynous-looking young male stars score commercial success as \u201csissy boys\u201d. The supposed softening of masculinity isn\u2019t seen to be in sync with grand national ambitions. But good luck trying to dictate teen fashion trends!\n\nFinally, a couple of years ago, Bingbing\u2019s extravagant TV series The Empress of China was puritanically censored to cover up cleavage. Episodes were re-edited to show the court ladies north of their chest only. She can\u2019t swat away her current troubles as easily. But where there is drama stars will rise and fans will follow, staying lithely ahead of the scissors and even taxmen.",

  "text": "Typically, the very mention of Bihar evokes mirth, Biharis are the butt of frequent jokes, and \u2018Bihari Buddhu\u2019 is not a term of endearment. Yet its origins are noble. \u2018Bihar\u2019 comes from the Sanskrit/Pali word \u2018Vihara\u2019 or abode. The region of Bihar used to be a confetti of Buddhist viharas in which the monks lived. Gautama Buddha first attracted a large following of believers and monks in Bihar. As with Christ\u2019s early followers, adherents of the new faith were mocked and ridiculed for their belief as \u2018Bihari Buddhus\u2019.\n\nIn similar vein, the storied history of Bihar is an integral part of India\u2019s glorious heritage. The wonderful new Bihar Museum in Patna, whose galleries opened last October, makes it abundantly clear just how much of Bihar is embedded in India\u2019s DNA.\n\nReferences to Bihar regions like Magadha, Mithila and Vaishali can be found in ancient texts and epics. Magadha was a renowned centre of power, learning and culture for a millennium under the Maurya and Gupta empires. The former included Ashoka the Great; the latter was a golden age for Indian science, mathematics, astronomy and philosophy. Bihar has been a major historical centre of learning, home to the universities of Nalanda, Odantapura and Vikramashila established in the 5th-8th centuries. Sher Shah Suri was an early pioneer of secularism and good governance.\n\nPataliputra (today\u2019s Patna) was a major global capital at the time of the Magadha empires. The world\u2019s first known republic was established in Vaishali by the 6th century BC. Bihar\u2019s key role in the freedom struggle was popularised in the movie Gandhi. Rajendra Prasad was India\u2019s first president and Jayaprakash Narayan carried on the freedom spirit in his opposition to Indira Gandhi\u2019s Emergency.\n\nWith a population of over 100 million Bihar is India\u2019s third biggest state, with obvious implications for national politics and development. Its importance to several major Indian religions registers less frequently on the nation\u2019s consciousness. It encompasses sites of great significance to Hindus, Buddhists and Jains \u2013 and Takht Sri Patna Sahib for the Sikhs is just across the river on the southern bank of the holy Ganga that bifurcates the state into north and south in a way that is unique.\n\nBuddhism has a worldwide following of over 500 million with significant numbers in southeast and east Asia. That the Buddha attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya is well known, the Mahabodhi Temple there is a Unesco World Heritage site and large numbers of devotees and tourists flock there, whose infra-structure has been significantly upgraded (including direct international flights).\n\nFor Jains, the 12th and 24th (last) Tirthankaras, Vasupujya and Vardhamana Mahavira, were born in Bhagalpur and Vaishali, respectively. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and last Sikh Guru, was born in Patna in 1666 and Guru Nanak and Guru Tegh Bahadur also visited.\n\nThen there is Sitamarhi, my home district. In a peaceful rural setting just 5 km west of Sitamarhi lies Sita Kund, the mythological site where Sita was found in an earthen pot as Raja Janaka ploughed his fields. Janaka excavated a tank on the site and after Sita\u2019s marriage, the legend continues, he ordered stone statues of Ram, Sita and Lakhsman to be erected there. In time dense jungles claimed all the lands there until about 500 years ago when the site was rediscovered, the jungle cleared and the stone figures recovered. A temple to Sita was constructed nearby and Janaki Mandir (not the original) is a popular pilgrimage for Hindu devotees.\n\nThe state government could vigorously market all these sites to potential tourists from India and abroad. Of course, tourists will not flock to Bihar merely because of a sophisticated promotion campaign. We must first address many physical, social and bureaucratic deficits.\n\nThe first requirement is assured public safety and law and order to neutralise the widespread perception that Bihar is synonymous with jungle raj. The state should invest heavily in recruiting and training civic officials and police officers to modern international standards, if necessary by breaking from the colonial-era IPS structure.\n\nWe must build a network of modern, clean, efficient and reliable rail, road and air corridors that transport people between destinations in comfort and on time. Patna can serve as the hub of international tourist traffic with a modern, passenger-friendly airport. I was heartened to experience recently the vastly improved roadways in northern Bihar as i toured many sacred Hindu sites in the three adjoining districts of Sitamarhi, Darbhanga and Madhubani.\n\nThird, in line with the PM\u2019s Swachh Bharat initiative, public facilities will have to be built and maintained to world class standards of cleanliness and hygiene. Open air spitting, urination and defecation is revolting, offensive and a public health hazard. Access to public conveniences is an absolute must for tourists. So is a reasonable supply of safe and clean accommodation and food outlets subject to regular inspections of hygiene norms.\n\nAll this must then be backed up by a sea change in the VIP culture that puts babus and netas on a pedestal. This grates increasingly even on Indians while foreigners are not used to second class treatment at the hand of public officials prone to petty corruption. Bihar could lead India with an efficient and responsive civil service and police force.\n\nThe upgrades to physical, social and administrative infrastructure will also create an attractive investment environment to promote Bihar\u2019s industrialisation. \u2018Bihari bhaiyyas\u2019 can then perform ghar wapsi with better quality work back home. Their triumphal homecoming will be the icing on the cake of a religious tourism-led development strategy for Bihar outlined here.",

  "text": "Last month, Indian Railways was touting its best safety record in five years citing the lowest number of fatalities in recent years. But as the derailment of the New Farakka Express at Rae Bareli and the consequent loss of lives reveals, there is much more work to be done on the rail safety front. At stake are the lives of lakhs of passengers who opt for trains because they find air travel prohibitively expensive and public road transport woefully inadequate. Only genuine improvement over time can reassure passengers about safety. Railways is passing through a period of transition and it must not repeat old mistakes.\n\nJunking the old populist practice of railway ministers announcing new trains in every budget before fulfilling older announcements and then dispensing with the Railway Budget had signalled a refreshing change in the political approach to the public transporter. The 2017-18 budget announcement of a Rs 1 lakh crore Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) to undertake safety projects over a five year period led to a rise in capital expenditure on track renewal, conversion of unmanned crossings, overhauling of old coaches and repairing of bridges.\n\nBut legacy problems remain. Track renewal, doubling and gauge conversion targets have been hampered by SAIL failing to deliver rails. Private sector steel companies must be roped in and the underperforming SAIL eased out. Another teething problem is the lax regard for safety standards among railway employees. There have been 31 accidents in the first five months of this fiscal compared to 29 in the same period last year. Perhaps, taking note of this rising trend, a recent Railway Board directive had warned field officials \u201cthat shortcuts which may lead to unsafe situations are not adopted.\u201d\n\nThis is almost a candid admission of lax safety protocols in place despite the 2012 Kakodkar committee revealing that over 40% of accidents could be traced to railway staff. The RRSK strategy of throwing money at the problem may not be adequate in a scenario where railways have to fill nearly 1.5 lakh non-gazetted vacancies in safety responsibilities. Structural reforms are also needed. The long pending proposal of a statutory Railway Safety Authority at an arm\u2019s length from other rail operations to avoid obvious conflict of interest requires urgent attention. The Rae Bareli accident must become a trigger for change before more lives are lost on the tracks.",

  "text": "Media\u2019s worst-kept secrets have been tumbling out. The siege within, ironically the title of an MJ Akbar book, has wounded more viscerally than the \u2018presstitute\u2019 attacks. Yes, the newsroom can be a predatory jungle. No, it\u2019s not always the irredeemable den of inequity as the recent exposes of #MeToo might suggest. How do the very women who so admirably uphold and epitomise gender equality become victims? Again, the key phrase is abuse of power. And senior mediamen feel extra entitled thanks to the bloated importance bestowed on them by the public. Regrettably, the same power is oft-times the fatal flame to the subordinate moths flocking to it in wide-eyed naivety.\n\nHubris is finally catching up with the arrogant offenders, but as with all free-for-all agendas, there\u2019s a real danger of the hashtag hijacking the cause. We need to concentrate on the real issue, and firewall it against distracting noise.\n\nWhat is non-negotiable, not subject to any \u2018but, how do we know?\u2019 escape routes is a man using his position of power to demand sexual favours \u2013 and the victim paying the price of refusal, the personal scars worse than the professional. If he has backed off in the face of resistance, it is only marginally less reprehensible. It\u2019s the senior mediaman\u2019s duty to preserve the sanctity of his internal domain, not just posture against the injustices outside. Take Sonora Jha Nambiar\u2019s 1996 case. She was the least imaginable target, yet she was hit upon by her editor. Worse, this outspoken journalist didn\u2019t expose this because, as she told me, she, not the perpetrator, would be professionally scarred.\n\nThis is what needs the surgical strike. And we need to restrain the hashtag-along junkies and their lesser issues which could undo the genuine abuse that has been so painfully revealed. \u2018Normal\u2019 gender relationships will always be more tango than waltz. So here\u2019s an updated if totally reductionist mantra. Avoid hierarchical entanglements; get the message at first shot; let \u2018no\u2019 be clear, unmistakable/taken at face value; read \u2018maybe\u2019 as \u2018never\u2019 until otherwise expressed. And let\u2019s hope that every \u2018yes\u2019 will not have to be taken in writing, or a screenshot.\n\n* * *\n\nAlec Smart said: \u201cStrange, \u2018me-too\u2019 once described someone WANTING a part of the action.\u201d",

  "text": "By Swami Prakarshananda\n\nIn life, we play many roles but there is one principal role that we share in common \u2013 to be the best human being possible. If prime importance is given to this role, then we will excel in the play of our other roles. Examine the life of Krishna. We find that he played every role to perfection \u2013 the role of a cowherd with his little friends, the role of a mischievous son, the part of a warrior, a king and even the role of charioteer. Can you imagine the controller of the whole universe tending horses, washing them, putting all the dung into a dung pit?\n\nHe did this to demonstrate that we must each be ready to play the role \u2018assigned\u2019 to us without any complaints. Observe the quality of the mind, when we have performed sincerely and given our best with no ulterior motives.\n\nIn every stage of life, each one has various roles to play. However, at any given point of time we have to focus on the role that is predominant under the given circumstances. For example, while at work in a corporate office, the predominant role is of an employee; other roles are secondary. If one lets the role of a husband, father or friend interfere with the role as an employee, one will not be able to do full justice to it. The attention will be divided and the performance will at best be mediocre.\n\nMaintain constant vigil, give priority to the role that the situation demands and also ensure that there is no intermixing of roles. This will guarantee that we give total attention to the task in hand, work to the best of our ability and maximise our potential. All else should be of no consequence at that time. The art of being aware of our thoughts and giving single-pointed attention to the role at hand, leads to increased levels of concentration.\n\nEach role comes with its own set of duties. While playing the role of a student, we must appreciate that the primary duty of a student is to work hard and excel in studies, maintain good health and ensure a conducive, learning atmosphere. In the role of a housewife, it is the duty of the lady, to care for the welfare of every family member and do the best by each one. Simultaneously, the homemaker must maintain her own physical as well as emotional wellbeing.\n\nThus, to avoid their intermingling, each one needs to master the technique of constant vigil, while playing the diverse roles presented at any given time. This will not happen in one day. A practice of continuous alertness towards the flow of thoughts while performing the action is required. Other distracting thoughts should be restrained from entering the mind. In the absence of alertness, an unsuspecting mind will entertain unnecessary thoughts from all directions. This will drastically affect the performance and reduce it to average or substandard levels.\n\nFor stability, peace and harmony to prevail, it is crucial to channelise one\u2019s energy towards constructive actions. It is essential to distinguish between constructive enabling actions and negative actions. Negative thoughts and actions which create instability, disturbance, disharmony need to be eliminated. To elevate the mind, it is vital and extremely important to follow these guidelines.\n\nThe writer is from Chinmaya Mission, Delhi.",

  "url": "https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/arrest-of-nakkheeran-journalist-bellittles-governors-office-in-tamil-nadu/",
  "text": "The office of the governor of Tamil Nadu has belittled its stature and sanctity by having journalist R Gopal, editor of Tamil bi-weekly Nakkheeran, arrested for reporting on a criminal case.\n\nIn April, an assistant professor of Devanga Arts College in Aruppukottai in Virdudhunagar district, Nirmala Devi was arrested on the basis of an audio clip in which she was allegedly asking girl students to extend sexual favours to officials in return for marks and money. Nakkheeran had reported that governor Banwarilal Purohit and his secretary R Rajagopal had held several meetings with Nirmala Devi.\n\nRead: Nakkheeran editor R Gopal arrested in Chennai based on complaint filed by Raj Bhavan\n\nAs governor, Purohit is the chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University to which the college is affiliated and it is not odd that he may have met the professor. Whatever the facts, the governor\u2019s office, after issuing initial statements of clarification, could have waited till the official investigation was over and facts were established. The Nirmala Devi case and her claims regarding the involvement of senior officials of the education department are being investigated by the CB-CID wing of the Tamil Nadu police.\n\nBut the police arrested R Gopal on Tuesday, almost six months after the report was published, on the basis of a complaint filed by the governor\u2019s deputy secretary. What is ludicrous here is that the police booked 35 employees, including 14 editors of Nakkheeran and arrested R Gopal under an unrelated section 124 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) which pertains to \u201cassaulting President, governor etc with intent to compel or restrain the exercise of any lawful power.\u201d The court justifiably questioned the validity of section 124 and refused to grant his remand.\n\nSuch misuse and abuse of the law by authorities for witch hunting journalists is unacceptable. Besides being an attack on the freedom of the press, it has also brought disrepute to the office of the governor, which should always avoid political controversies. The governor\u2019s office and police must immediately withdraw the complaint and the FIR against all 35 employees of the bi-weekly.",

  "url": "https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bloody-mary/grammar-of-violence-why-todays-politics-has-rendered-gandhis-birth-anniversary-celebrations-meaningless/",
  "text": "The celebrations marking the start of the 150th birth anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhi were predictably ritualistic. Each political party invoked the father of Indian nationalism for its own cause, seeking to co-opt Gandhi for success at the ballot box. Yet sadly, today the Mahatma\u2019s cardinal, indeed fundamental, teaching, namely that of non-violence, is regularly overthrown. There is an outward celebration of Gandhian non-violence, but an unprecedented violence in political language. Words are weaponised. Speeches are violent. Name calling, threats, attacking slogans and foully abusive rhetoric is the grammar of politicians. The violence of today\u2019s political vocabulary shows how 150 years after Gandhi, the Mahatma\u2019s legacy is being destroyed by those who claim his mantle.\n\nAddressing party workers in Delhi, BJP President Amit Shah referred to illegal migrants as \u201ctermites\u201d gnawing at the country from within. In an earlier speech he referred to migrants identified in the Assam NRC as \u201cghuspethiye\u201d. Said Shah: \u201cThey enter here, throw bombs and kill innocent citizens. Should we not protect the human rights of our people?\u201d A BJP leader from Telangana said if Rohingya do not leave, they should be \u201cshot\u201d. In another speech to BJP social media volunteers in Rajasthan, Shah appeared to be endorsing fake news when he said that the efficient dissemination of a fake WhatsApp message about Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav slapping his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, showed how party workers are capable of delivering any message to the public (although he did add the caveat he didn\u2019t think this was the right approach). Gandhi the seeker of truth would have been shaken to the core.\n\nThe Left created a brutally violent political culture in Bengal. Armed cadres regularly enforced party diktats by terrorising citizens. Today the violent language regularly exchanged between supporters of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her rivals has again spilled over into pitched battles on the streets, with alleged supporters of Trinamool caught on tape assaulting political rivals. The Mahatma\u2019s last days were spent trudging the blood soaked path in Bengal\u2019s Noakhali bringing peace to areas torn apart by communal riots. What would Gandhi have made of BJP MP and Union minister Babul Supriyo\u2019s threat to break a man\u2019s leg and put him in crutches at an event for the disabled?\n\nWhen politics ceases to be a clash of competing ideas and manifestos, when it is only a slugfest between mortal enemies, when politics is deeply personalised, violent vocabulary becomes inevitable because there are no substantive arguments on differing policies or programmes or ideas. In 2013, Congress\u2019s Salman Khurshid called then-Gujarat CM Narendra Modi a \u201cfrog\u201d. BJP\u2019s Meenakshi Lekhi in turn called Khurshid a \u201ccockroach\u201d. What genuine debate can there be about cockroaches and frogs?\n\nVerbal violence is always a precursor to physical violence. When those in power engage in verbal violence it becomes a cue to the administrative machinery down the line to turn a blind eye when verbal violence manifests itself on the streets. When political leaders actively rationalise violence, the official machinery is not only tempted to overlook the rule of law, it paves the way for violence against anyone seen as a dissenter.\n\nLast month the arrest of rights activists saw a barrage of violent language. The activists were termed \u2018urban naxals\u2019 plotting to create unrest and deserving to be jailed. It required the Supreme Court to step in and insist that due process of law be followed. Gandhi would have condemned the use of arms by Maoists or in Kashmir, But Gandhi\u2019s analysis of violence was so comprehensive that he even saw any imposition of his own authority on Congress as an act of violence. Gandhi believed violent language against political opponents made self-rule impossible. Swaraj was only possible by respecting the rival because a resort to the vocabulary of violence meant that the cause for which one was fighting was lost. Violent language for Gandhi was ultimately self-destructive because the revolution would then turn on itself, losing focus on the ultimate goal.\n\nWhy do politicians today use verbal violence? Verbal violence preys on fears and insecurities and leads to voters disregarding real issues. Verbal violence also energises cadres. It involves designating enemies, thus encouraging voters to vote according to group identities and not according to their rational individual conscience. Verbal violence was once the tactic of fringe politicians such as a Bal Thackeray or a Vinay Katiyar, but when it becomes a tactic deployed by mainstream politicians there is no space left for any kind of substantive debate on bread and butter issues that affect citizens\u2019 daily lives.\n\nIn the 1970s when politicians abused each other as \u201cSoviet stooge\u201d or \u201cCIA stooge\u201d, at least name calling had some ideological colour. But today personalised insults like \u2018mera PM chor hai\u2019 and \u2018Rahul ka khandaan chor hai\u2019 reveal only a war of personal epithets. As a result much needed debate on the economy, or caste quotas or secularism is totally missing. All we have is a violently expressed contest on who is a bigger Shiv bhakt or Gandhi bhakt or Ambedkar bhakt.\n\nIn the absence of any debate on future public policy, there\u2019s only space for violent language which leads to physical combat on the streets. Today, Gandhi\u2019s favourite hymn Vaishnava Jana To is being played in 124 countries. There\u2019s a well publicised Swachh Bharat campaign. There\u2019s furious competition between BJP and Congress in Wardha for Gandhi\u2019s legacy. Gandhi\u2019s charkha and spectacles are used for government schemes. Yet almost every party is invoking the ultimate symbol of non violence to legitimise their violent language and methods.",

Think of all the birthday bashing we can cram into a whole year.\n\n1st bhakt: The only problem is in deciding whom to bash first, considering we\u2019ve got so many on our \u2018Who to bash\u2019 list. Should we start with those anti-national leftie intellectuals, or minorities, or people who look like what we think cow smugglers should look like, or \u2026\n\n2nd bhakt (cutting 1st bhakt short): I know we have a whole lot of birthday bashing to do.\n\n1st bhakt: But wasn\u2019t Bapuji the apostle of ahimsa, the prophet of non-violence? So how come we get to celebrate his birthday bash by bashing up people?\n\n2nd bhakt: Simple. I\u2019ll practice ahimsa on you, and you practice non-violence on me. Everyone else is fair game.\n\n1st bhakt: Makes sense. So how should we start? How about a Dandi March except in our case it\u2019ll be a Danda March.\n\n2nd bhakt: Great idea! A danda is just what these lefties and minorities need. And the bigger the danda the better.\n\n1st bhakt: What else can we do to follow in Bapuji\u2019s footsteps? He used a charkha to spin khadi. Should we take up spinning khadi?\n\n2nd bhakt: I don\u2019t know about using a charkha to spin khadi. But I do know that we\u2019re already using a modern version of the charkha called social media to spin fake news, which is better than khadi, or anything else, when it comes to cloaking fiction and passing it off as fact.\n\n1st bhakt: You\u2019re so right. Fake news is our very own version of satyagraha by which we take truth and tailor it to suit our needs and make it whatever we want it to be.\n\n2nd bhakt: Then we should launch a Quit India movement and get all these illegal immigrants to quit the country.\n\n1st bhakt: Why stop at illegal immigrants? We should also get legal immigrants to quit the country, if they belong to the wrong community.\n\n2nd bhakt: It\u2019s going to be great fun celebrating Bapuji\u2019s birthday bash. I wonder what he\u2019d say about it.\n\n1st bhakt: I don\u2019t think he\u2019d say anything about it. He\u2019d be left totally speechless\u2026.",

  "text": "The Nobel prize for economics in 2018 was awarded to Paul Romer and William Nordhaus for their work in two separate areas: economic growth and environmental economics respectively. But there is a common thread in their work. Productive activity often has spillovers, meaning that it can impact an unrelated party. In economic jargon it\u2019s termed an externality. Romer and Nordhaus both studied the impact of externalities and came up with profound insights and economic models. Among recent economics Nobels, it\u2019s hard to think of one more topical and relevant to India.\n\nEconomic growth has often been associated with large environmental damage in the form of pollution and environmental degradation. This is unsustainable for a variety of reasons, including social friction triggered by people protesting the costs they are forced to incur on account of externalities. Romer\u2019s work highlighted the power of ideas in achieving growth while limiting environmental cost. These ideas are given life by improved technology. To illustrate, India\u2019s high growth phase has been accompanied by lower energy use per unit GDP because of access to better technology. The key policy question here is, what is the best way to unlock a society\u2019s wellspring of creativity?\n\nThe issue was highlighted in the latest report of the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released this Monday. Its contents are alarming for India as agriculture may be significantly impacted even by a 1.5\u00b0C increase in average global temperature. Tackling it requires meeting two challenges. One, to get global coordination as this externality is not limited to national boundaries. Two, gauging the extent of trade-off between economic activity and environmental goals. Nordhaus is an advocate of carbon taxes, which means the emitter should incur the social cost.\n\nIf there is a lesson for India\u2019s policy making in their work, it is that sustainable prosperity is possible only when we massively enhance the quality of human capital and policy making. It\u2019s schools and universities which determine a country\u2019s long-run economic trajectory. They are incubators of ideas which can be the most important positive externality. Moreover, policy making must evaluate tradeoffs more holistically. For example, ethanol blended petrol may save a bit of foreign exchange. But what will it do to food production or our fast depleting water tables? Assessing externalities is therefore at the heart of successful policy.",

  "text": "Rajasthan, one of five states where assembly elections are due, will witness a head-on contest between BJP and Congress. Sachin Pilot, the Congress\u2019 state unit president, talks to Amin Ali about campaign issues:\n\nBJP says Congress is a divided house. Do you agree?\n\nIn Rajasthan, Amit Shah and state CM Vasundhara Raje are running separate campaigns. The party was without a state president for 75 days and it was clear to everyone that even Amit Shah was not able to get a state president of his choice and had to succumb to Vasundhara\u2019s stubbornness. The entire state knows all is not well between BJP president and state CM. If we are a divided house in the state, how did we manage to win local body elections and bypolls to assembly and Lok Sabha? I am one of the fortunate state presidents to have received overwhelming support and cooperation from all our party leaders. It is due to our collective hard work that we have won the confidence of the state and people are within striking distance of having arrogant BJP voted out of power.\n\nBJP accuses your party of supporting Maoists. How do you counter that?\n\nThe language and issues raised by the BJP president are purely to drive attention away from their lack of governance. Amit Shah came to Rajasthan and raised the issue of National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. He doesn\u2019t realise that over the 10 years of UPA government, we deported thousands of illegal immigrants whereas BJP has no record to show. The real issues of the country are rising petrol prices, unemployment and mismanagement of economy. The state of Rajasthan is seeing a rise in number of rape cases, agrarian distress and constant strikes by various bodies. Rather than address these issues, they are trying to save their face by levelling false allegations against the party and our president Rahul Gandhi.\n\nBJP has a clear leader in PM Modi, while arguing that an opportunistic and \u2018faceless\u2019 opposition alliance is being stitched.\n\nBJP is losing allies by the day. They are the ones stitching alliances with even their bitter and sworn rivals just to get power. Congress on the other hand has appealed to all like-minded parties who support constitutional principles and respect the institutions of our country to come together. We are not arrogant like BJP who believe in one-man rule. We respect the mandate of people and the leader will be decided based on that mandate. Rahul Gandhi is meeting people and parties regularly and forming a rainbow coalition of parties based on principles.\n\nHasn\u2019t your ally NCP disagreed with your stand on Rafale?\n\nNCP has clarified that Sharad Pawar did not give any clean chit to Modi. That statement like many others in the past are being misused by the BJP. They can run their fake propaganda but people of principle are coming together to protest fuel prices crossing Rs 90 a litre, joblessness, corruption and an acrimony in public discourse.\n\nBJP says it will seek votes on the development card. Does Congress have an issue other than targeting the PM?\n\nIf jumlas are going to be a campaign strategy then the results of bypolls are the answer by the people of the country. BJP\u2019s falsehood is apparent and the mask has fallen off. They tried their best to communalise the elections in Alwar. But youngsters with access to technology saw through their propaganda and defeated them by over 2 lakh votes. We are focused on raising the issues actually affecting the common man and are winning the trust of the people.\n\nCongress, and specifically Rahul Gandhi, are referred to as the weakest links in the opposition.\n\nIn last four-and-a-half years, Rahul Gandhi has single handedly raised pertinent issues. The government was forced to back off on land acquisition plans due to his protest. It could not go ahead with its anti-dalit, anti-farmer and anti-small business policies due to Rahul Gandhi\u2019s stand. People across the country are talking about Rafale as Rahul Gandhi has exposed the corruption in the deal, led from the front and asked uncomfortable questions.\n\nHas his stand on various issues struck a chord with people?\n\nI became party president in Rajasthan when we won just 21 MLAs (seats) out of 200. Since then if we were to add the number of seats, including Lok Sabha and assembly by-polls, that have voted, Congress won 20 out of 22 such seats. He has clearly emerged as the most dedicated opposition leader to anti-people policies of this government and this is giving strength to opposition parties and people of the country alike.",

  "text": "By Nayaswami Jyotish\n\nI\u2019m feeling better today. I fasted yesterday, in part to help clear out some respiratory congestion i\u2019ve had since we got back from India a few days ago. For this particular purpose, i did a fast called the Master Cleanse, in which you drink a lemonade consisting of lemon juice, grade B maple syrup, and a little cayenne powder diluted with water. Occasionally, Devi and i will do Paramhansa Yogananda\u2019s marvelous nine-day cleansing and vitalising diet, which consists of lots of citrus, raw vegetables, a daily steamed vegetable, and a special \u2018vitality beverage\u2019.\n\nFasting for religious reasons: I noticed during our trips to India that fasting is much more common there. We often encountered people who declined food at social gatherings, saying simply, \u201cToday is my fast day.\u201d Fasting is also done for religious reasons. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, continued his annual nine-day Navaratri fast even during his trip to America. This annual honouring of the Divine Mother, and the triumph of good over evil, must have caused some head scratching during the state dinners.\n\nPhysical benefits of fasting: It is now common medical knowledge that there are many important physical benefits to fasting. Among other things, it detoxifies the cells, strengthens the immune system, controls blood sugar, and improves dietary habits. People also commonly use fasting to lose weight. The physical benefits are actually secondary, however, to the psychological and spiritual advantages.\n\nPsychological benefits of fasting: Psychological benefits of fasting include strengthening one\u2019s will power and resetting poor eating habits, which seem to accumulate like burrs when we walk without awareness through life\u2019s fields. When we fast, we strongly declare, \u201cI am in control here once again.\u201d\n\nSpiritual benefits of fasting: But the most important reasons for fasting are spiritual. Paramhansa Yogananda recommended that we fast one day per week and three days per month. He said fasting was one way to increase our spiritual magnetism, which he defined as \u201cthe power of the soul to attract or create whatever it needs for all-around happiness and well-being.\u201d Here are some of his other statements about the spiritual benefits of fasting:\n\n\u201cYou, the soul, are far more than the perishable body of flesh. In fasting, you discover that it is the cosmic energy, or prana, in the body that actually sustains you. Jesus pointed this out when he said, \u2018Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u2019 The \u2018mouth of God\u2019 is the subtle centre in the medulla through which divine life energy, the \u2018Word\u2019, flows into the body from its cosmic source.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cFasting cleanses your blood and gives rest to your organs; a revitalised energy begins to flow through your eyes and hands and feet. Thus, when you are fasting you can transmit more healing energy to others when praying for them. As soon as you begin to realise you are living on cosmic energy and not on gross substances your body becomes magnetic.\u201d\n\nAs i said, i\u2019m feeling much better after my day of fasting, and i don\u2019t mean only physically.

  "text": "In India, the increased medical costs are the biggest concerns among the individuals. Moreover, the kind of lifestyles people prefer nowadays can ultimately lead to several health issues and turnout in augmented expenditure on hospital bills.\n\nOpting for an optimum health insurance plan helps in maintaining the uncertainties and instabilities by offering a financial steadiness that\u2019s difficult to find anywhere else. Also, it\u2019s always a wise choice to have you and your family covered for any medical emergencies that may knock your door anytime in the future.\n\nWhat is Health Insurance?\n\nHealth Insurance is basically a contract between the insurer and the policyholder wherein the insurance company pays for the medical expenses incurred by the life insured. In this case, the policyholder is either eligible for the cashless treatment or the insurer provides a reimbursement for the medical expenses under the policy at one of the selective network hospitals. One additional pros of opting to health insurance are that you can also get tax deductions on the premiums paid towards the health insurance under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\n\nThe factors you need to know before buying Health Insurance Plans include co-pay (a fixed percentage of the hospital bill you will have to pay when you make a claim), waiting period for pre-existing disease, lifelong renewable and room rent.\n\nHow is your premium for Health Insurance Plan calculated?\n\nYour age is one of the key factors for your premium amount that means lower your age lower would be your premium cost. Furthermore, the premium also depends on the number of insured members of your family, the preference of your room during hospitalization (Costlier the room, higher will be the treatment charges) and the pre-existing medical condition.\n\nTips for buying Health Insurance Plans\n\nFirstly, you need to consider your budget in order to avoid paying huge premiums. Be conscious enough before selecting any option; do not pick the options blindly because this might eventually elevate your premium amount. Secondly, you must read the fine print meticulously and know what features are covered under the policy. With in-depth knowledge about all the definitions, exclusions, terms and conditions and other benefits offered, one can make smart decisions while buying health insurance plan.\n\nIn addition to this, you can decide which family member to include in your health insurance plan. Also, your room preference needs to be taken into consideration. The best health insurance plans are the ones which cover the unforeseen medical expenses for critical illnesses like stroke, cancer etc.\n\nWhat are the options for Health Insurance Plans in India?\n\nMedical insurance plans can be categorized broadly into different types. The various types of Health Insurance Plans include individual plans, maternity insurance plans, family floater health plans, personal accident covers, plans for senior citizens, critical illness insurance plans and group or insurance plans.\n\nOne of the best things about health insurance plan in India is that it can be personalized as per the individual\u2019s requirement. Here, the insured person can make the choice whether he or she wants to go with a plan that covers critical illnesses, maternity expenses, accident-related expenses, outpatient expenses or a combination of all.",

  "text": "India needs to be wary of Chinese overtures to deepen trade ties while the Donald Trump administration wages a trade war with China over its malpractices. It is doubtful that the advantages of strengthening trade with China will outweigh the disadvantages India continues to face from China\u2019s own protectionism.\n\nChina has imposed higher tariffs on 603 items imported from the US. As per a governmental study of the union commerce ministry, out of these 603, the US exports of 262 items to China is negligible. Another 149 items that the US exports to China are less than $10 million. As a result, more than half the items on which China has imposed high tariffs, do not provide significant or lucrative opportunities for India to be a substitute trade partner.\n\nOut of the 603 items on which China has imposed higher tariffs on US imports, India could benefit substantially from 17. But China has denied market access to India even as China gets disproportionate access to Indian markets. For example, even as India plays a major role in the global pharmaceutical market, only 1% of India\u2019s exports go to China, which incidentally happens to be the second largest pharmaceutical market of the world.\n\nRead also: Amid US friction, China wants India to deepen trade ties\n\nIndia at the moment exports only 44 items from the US list to China and it is very unlikely that China will give India much leverage on the 17 items. Besides, just as Beijing factors geopolitical interests into the trade access it provides, New Delhi should also factor in China\u2019s consistent support to Pakistan against India. Without addressing concerns such as CPEC and Pakistan\u2019s cross-border terrorism, India does not have much incentive to be China\u2019s friend in its trade war with the US.\n\nTherefore, India must exhibit caution in its response to Chinese overtures now that Beijing is in trouble. It must not unsettle its newly established strategic relationship with the US for minimal gains, even as China\u2019s offer to ease some non-tariff barriers looks currently appealing.",

  "text": "China Reform and Opening \u2013 Forty Years in Perspective\n\nReforming an economy without Western theory\n\nEditor's note: Laurence Brahm, first came to China as a fresh university exchange student from the US in 1981 and he has spent much of the past three and a half decades living and working in the country. He has been a lawyer, a writer, and now he is Founding Director of Himalayan Consensus and a Senior International Fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.\n\nHe has captured his own story and the nation's journey in China Reform and Opening \u2013 Forty Years in Perspective. China Daily is running a series of articles every Thursday starting from May 24 that reveal the changes that have taken place in the country in the past four decades. Keep track of the story by following us.\n\nThe author(L) with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet during one of her visits to Beijing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]\n\nBeijing in the spring can be blustery and cold, as the last winter winds whirl across the city and the aroma of early flowers awakening. In March 2000, at the closing news conference of the Third Plenum of the Ninth National People's Congress, a journalist asked Zhu Rongji how he wanted to be remembered by the Chinese people after his term in office. Zhu just laughed and made the following remarks.\n\n\"I only hope that when I leave this position, the people can say one thing: He is a clean official, not a corrupt official. With this I am satisfied. If the people are more generous and say, 'Zhu Rongji actually accomplished some matters of substance,' then I must express my great thanks.\u201d\n\nFrom the moment he assumed the role of vice-premier, Zhu had managed China's transformation into a market economy over the critical decade of 1992-2002. Unabashedly combining the tools of command and market economics, Zhu brought inflation down from 21.7 percent in 1994 to to 1 percent by 2001, while maintaining an average 8 percent growth rate over this same period. He streamlined and rationalized China's banking and financial systems, taking on and closing down the bastions of the old unregulated system. He steered China through the Asian financial crisis without devaluing the renminbi, strengthening the currency in the process. The reforms he had overseen as premier involved re-engineering the State-owned enterprises, cutting government bureaucracies by half, and replacing the iron rice-bowl system with the framework of a modern social- security and insurance-based healthcare and pension system. Such reforms have involved more than structural changes and institutional capacity building. They have required the re-engineering of Chinese society as a whole.\n\nIt is hard to imagine the leader of any other country daring to take the political risks inherent in tackling economic and financial challenges on such a scale as China has. Yet Zhu did and, arguably, succeeded. In doing so, he has ignored the formulas preached by the Washington Consensus and defied the once sacrosanct International Monetary Fund prescription for developing countries. Many of those who accepted the economic panacea proffered by Western academics have lived to regret it. Zhu, however, developed his own practical model suited to Chinese realities. His own theory of a \"macro-control system\u201d powered the managed marketization of China's economy, which is all the stronger for it today.\n\nThis is really where the idea of sequencing began. Zhu recognized that none of the individual problems could be tackled in isolation. To reform the system, all issues would have to be confronted together, but in a logical order of layered priority. It was a complete rejection of market fundamentalism and shock therapy. Economists would later dub it \"sequencing\".\n\nZhu Rongji's contribution has been in seeking a middle road for economic reform to achieve marketization of the world's fastest-growing mega economy, and doing so while maintaining political cohesiveness and broad-based social stability. His model of \"managed marketization\u201d is one that can be adopted and applied to other developing or transitional economies. It provides a practically proven alternative to the market fundamentalism and shock therapy theories coming out of US universities and Washington think tanks. For China, Zhu Rongji's legacy has been the transformation of this nation's economy from a planned to a market system, while maintaining high growth and broad-based political and social stability. The world should give due recognition to Zhu Rongi for the successful application of a new economic development model of managed marketization. His name should be remembered alongside that of Keynes.\n\n\n\nZhu Rongji provided a practical demonstration of how fusion, crossover economics can prove to be a viable option, and has brought economic theory into a new epoch. As Deng Xiaoping once said to Zhu in Shanghai during the 1992 Spring Festival, \"Planning and market are both tools to accompany the use of resources, but are not in themselves standards of socialism or capitalism.\" The world community of economists should finally give credit where it is due.\n\n\n\nPlease click here to read previous articles.",

  "text": "Editor's note: After his meeting with Kim Jong-un, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korean in Pyongyang on Oct 8, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed the two countries can make \"real progress\" on denuclearization at a second summit. Two experts shared their views with China Daily's Pan Yixuan on how to achieve further development. Excerpts follow:\n\nUS and DPRK have to narrow gap in expectations\n\nWang Sheng, a researcher at the Co-Innovation Center for Korean Peninsula Studies and professor of International Politics at Jilin University\n\nMeeting Kim, confirming the DPRK's willingness to continue denuclearizing, and reaching some agreements on Kim's next meeting with US President Donald Trump, Pompeo's trip was another step forward for the two countries.\n\nHowever, there were no breakthroughs announced on the denuclearization stalemate. Pyongyang did not make a declaration as urged by Washington and Washington did not promise the reciprocity required by Pyongyang. Though the convocation of another summit between the US and DPRK leaders appears to be in the cards, they may still quite differ in their agendas.\n\nWhen Pompeo visited the Republic of Korea before he met Kim, the ROK put up a proposal that the US could sign a declaration to end the Korean War, which would be easier to reach in a short term, in exchange for the US inspecting the DPRK's dismantling of its nuclear weapons sites. But the US prefers a peace treaty which will take more time.\n\nThere is little doubt that Washington and Pyongyang want peace talks because Pyongyang needs the international sanctions removed to develop its economy, and Washington wants a remarkable achievement before the midterm election in November.\n\nPompeo acknowledged China's contributions to Peninsula denuclearization and China's potential role in a peace treaty, which may be an intention to increase pressure on the DPRK to take bolder steps in denuclearization. But when Pompeo visited East Asia, vice-foreign minister of the DPRK Choe Son-hui held trilateral talks with Russia and China in Moscow on Oct 9, which could be the DPRK's attempt to gain more support for its expectations of the denuclearization negotiations.\n\nThere will be no substantial development at a second US-DPRK summit, if one takes place, unless the US and the DPRK narrow their differences. In the current period, Washington's views on the ROK's end-of-war proposal is important.\n\nUS must adopt more flexible approach\n\nJin Qiangyi, a researcher at the Center for North and South Korea Studies of Yanbian University\n\nThe DPRK dismantling its nuclear test sites and missile facilities is only freezing its nuclear program. For complete denuclearization, the DPRK will have to accept inspections of the dismantling process and declare all the details of its nuclear weapons. Therefore it is hard to expect the US to act in line with Pyongyang's series of \"denuclearizing efforts\".\n\nHowever, the US should change its tough stance and ease the pressure on the DPRK. Pyongyang will not do more substantial denuclearization without reciprocation. In fact, the stalemate between Washington and Pyongyang has not changed much. The international community should listen to the DPRK about its concerns to make a real breakthrough.\n\nIt is difficult for the United Nations to lift sanctions and for the US to reduce its military threat. But action-for-action reciprocity should be brokered by other countries, such as a promise of not worsening sanctions in the current phase, easing sanctions if Pyongyang make tangible progress toward denuclearization, a schedule of economic aid and cooperation in line with further advancements. It is time to draft plans to support the DPRK's economic recovery and opening-up as economic development should be the DPRK's priority.\n\nFor example, if the US, China, the ROK, Russia, and Japan, which have interests in Northeast Asia, all want to take a lead in the denuclearization process, the process cannot move steadily unless they move in the same direction. There needs to be joint economic support for a denuclearized Pyongyang.",

[Photo by Zhu Xingxin/China Daily]\n\nChina's largest telecom equipment maker and smartphone vendor Huawei Technologies Co Ltd unveiled a range of artificial intelligence chips on Wednesday, in what is arguably its biggest-ever push to expand its presence in the semiconductor sector and to compete with US companies such as Nvidia Corp.\n\nThe move is also part of Huawei's broader effort in AI. The company is working to offer a full-stack technological portfolio to support all AI application scenarios.\n\nHuawei said one of the new processors, known as the Ascend 910, boasts the greatest computing density in a single chip in the world, whose performance can beat its rival product Nvidia V100. Ascend 910 is scheduled to hit the market in the second quarter of 2019. And it will be deployed on Huawei's cloud solutions to drive data centers.\n\nThe new processor is part of broader chip series Huawei released on Wednesday. Another chip, known as the Ascend 310, is designed to drive low-power computing with high efficiency.\n\nXu Zhijun, rotating chairman of Huawei, said these chips will not be sold as standalone products. \"Instead, we will develop products such as AI servers, AI accelerators and autonomous driving solutions based on these processors and sell them to clients.\"\n\nThese chips are based on an architecture called DaVinci, developed by Huawei. The tech heavyweight has already used intellectual properties from Chinese startup Cambricon Technology to design AI chips for its smartphones.\n\n\"Cambricon's IP is quite good, but it is not enough to meet our needs to have chips that can support all AI application scenarios. We want to have an architecture that can deliver both extremely big computing capacity and extremely low-power consumption,\" Xu said.\n\n\"We will give our processors to partners for trial use,\" he added.\n\nWang Yanhui, secretary-general of the Mobile China Alliance, said it will not be easy for Huawei to take on Nvidia just by winning in terms of technology parameters.\n\n\"Nvidia has developed a well-established ecosystem with large pool of clients,\" Wang said. \"As a newcomer, Huawei's approach of selling chips and services as a package may be more appealing to clients than selling them standalone.\"",

CHINA DAILY\n\nAfter years of preparation, construction of a branch of the Palace Museum formally kicked off on Wednesday in Beijing's northwestern outskirts.\n\nThe branch, covering 62 hectares in the north of Haidian district, will serve as satellite institution of the complex that was China's imperial palace from 1420 to 1911, also known as the Forbidden City.\n\nThe branch will include 35,000 square meters of exhibition space, a conservation center for cultural relics of 20,000 sq m and a warehouse of 23,000 sq m, according to Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum.\n\nPlans call for it to fully open in June 2022, but the conservation center may be ready for visits by the public in 2020, when 600th birthday of the Forbidden City falls, Shan said.\n\nShan Jixiang, the museum's director, briefs reporters on the branch's construction. ZOU HONG/CHINA DAILY\n\n\"Having such an institution will improve our service and expand our room to display our collections,\" he said. The lack of sufficient exhibition space has been a lingering problem for the museum, which houses about 1.86 million cultural relics.\n\nThe need to provide a safe and secure environment for artifacts exhibited in the ancient buildings has meant that only 2 percent of the museum's treasures can be simultaneously displayed to the public.\n\n\"Our collections of large items, like the huge number of tapestries and sedan chairs, particularly need exhibition spaces,\" Shan said. \"It's currently impossible to display them in the Forbidden City, but the new museum will offer good conditions to put them on display.\"\n\nThe director said the new museum will also become a hub for studying the horticulture of the imperial age. Plants grown there will be taken to the Forbidden City in downtown Beijing for display.\n\n\"Sometimes, it's difficult to breed some plants downtown because of the urban heat,\" he said. \"It's better to do so in the outskirts.\"\n\nThe new complex will be also used to preserve and pass along expertise in the renovation of ancient architecture and traditional craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen who are inheritors of intangible cultural heritage will join in renovation of cultural relics to revive old techniques.\n\nThere are many reasons for the location for the new museum. \"This choice is to respect history,\" Shan said.\n\n\"During imperial years, when the royal family needed more space for palaces or resorts, they tended to choose a new area in northwestern Beijing, as in the case of the Summer Palace.\"\n\nThe new site also holds the remains of an old porcelain kiln. The kiln, which was used for items for the royalty, will become another attraction.\n\nThe new building's design was chosen from five final entries, based on the judgment of scholars and public input, Shan said. The museum administration opposed any \"maverick\" plan from overseas studios and invited domestic talent to submit proposals.\n\nThe architectural plan selected is from a team led by Zhang Yu with the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design.\n\nRed and yellow\uff0dtwo colors that were often used by royalty in the Forbidden City\uff0dare featured in the new complex. The eco-friendly and energy-saving construction also is designed to match the surrounding natural environment.\n\nSupport infrastructure such as subway access also is planned. Shan said he expects the museum branch to receive 3 million annual visits.\n\nWang Ning, deputy mayor, said the museum \"can be a hub for cross-border cultural communication and thus help our goal of making Beijing a global city\".",

[Photo/IC]\n\nChina has refuted claims by United States leaders that \"the US really rebuilt China\", saying that the development of any country ultimately depends on itself.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a news briefing on Wednesday that China mainly owes its tremendous achievement in development to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the country's unwavering efforts in pushing forward reform and opening up, as well as the diligence and wisdom of the Chinese people.\n\nThe claim by US leaders that attributes China's achievement to chronic trade surpluses in Beijing's favor is logically untenable, he said.\n\nRather than pursuing development within a vacuum, China has always kept its door wide open to conduct win-win cooperation with different countries, he added.\n\n\"As a country with a population of close to 1.4 billion, it is impossible for China to rely on the charity of others for its development. I am afraid that there is simply no country with such capabilities to rebuild China,\" he said.\n\nLu said the US trade deficit with China is a result of comparative advantages of China and division of labor factors.\n\nChina's foreign trade has always been in line with market principles and conducted fairly. The US buys more from China than it sells, and it also has self-imposed restrictions on exports of some products, which has naturally resulted in deficits, he said.\n\n\"It is unfair and improper that the US denounces China on these grounds,\" Lu said.\n\nMeanwhile, bilateral trade between China and US is by no means one way traffic that transports wealth to China, he said, adding that the US has long gained wide and tremendous economic benefits from business and trade cooperation with China.\n\n\"Nobody is willing to make deals destined to lose, not to mention for 20 years,\" he said.\n\nChina urges the US to adopt the right mentality, respect facts, stop groundless accusations against China, and do more to benefit businesses and consumers, Lu said.\n\nEstimates by the US-China Business Council last year showed trade with China saved typical US families up to $850 in 2015.\n\nA report released by Deutsche Bank in June said that even though China enjoyed a $376 billion trade surplus with the US in 2017, Chinese consumers own more iPhones and buy more General Motors cars than US consumers do.\n\n\"These cars and phones are sold to China not through US exports, but through Chinese subsidiaries of US multinational enterprises,\" the report said.",

[Photo/VCG]\n\nCarrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said on Wednesday that the government will \"fearlessly\" move in accordance with the law against acts that advocate \"Hong Kong independence\".\n\nIn summarizing this year's Policy Address to the Legislative Council, Lam emphasized the government's firm stance on national security.\n\nLam said neither she nor the government will tolerate any advocacy of \"independence\" for Hong Kong or acts that threaten national security, sovereignty or development.\n\nShe also announced an ambitious plan to greatly increase the city's land supply to address its housing issues.\n\nIn discussing no fewer than 250 new initiatives this year, Lam mentioned housing 84 times, compared with 45 times a year ago, making it the most frequently used word in her speech. Land was brought up 71 times, more than double the 34 times last year. Lam made land supply and housing a separate section of her speech, placing it before economy and people's livelihoods.\n\n\"The purpose is to demonstrate clearly that the shortage of land not only directly leads to a shortage of housing, but also affects people's quality of life,\" she said.\n\nLeading Lam's plans was a reclamation project dubbed Lantau Tomorrow Vision. The new, long-term project aims to develop artificial islands with a total area of 1700 hectares east of Lantau Island.\n\nIt is estimated it could provide residential units for 700,000 to 1.1 million people, with 70 percent being public housing, she said. The reclamation's study and design work will start soon, with the aim of starting the first phase in 2025.\n\nLam said the SAR government will persevere in developing new land and building a land reserve. \"The determination will never waver in the face of short-term fluctuations in the economy or the rise and fall of property prices,\" she said.\n\nLantau, the city's largest outlying island, which hosts Hong Kong International Airport, is seen as becoming a gateway to the world and other Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area cities after the commissioning of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.\n\nAlso planned are development of brownfield sites and revitalization of industrial buildings.\n\nIn addition, Lam unveiled other policies such as improving women's rights and innovation.\n\nThe Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the largest city political party in the legislature, showed its support for land and housing measures. Starry Lee Waiking, the party chairwoman, said the speech responded to the public's expectations.\n\nThe Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce called the speech \"visionary\" in a way that will address the city's difficulties.\n\nThe University Grants Committee, responsible for advising the SAR government on the funding and development of higher education, welcomed the new research initiatives.\n\nYang Zekun contributed to this story.",

With a top speed of around 140 kilometers per hour, drones used in the race can reach zero to 100 km/h within 1.6 seconds.\n\nThe Drone Champions League is the pioneer of drone racing. Since its 2016 launch in Europe, DCL is dedicated to organizing races in iconic landmarks across the world.\n\n\u201cAs the Drone Champions League races only take place at exceptional locations, the natural choice for the Chinese venue landed on the Great Wall of China and Simatai,\u201d said Herbert Weirather, CEO of DCL. \u201cWe have seen a large active drone racing community in China who is also interested in the Drone Champions Leagues. A race in China was the obvious desired location for a race.\u201d\n\nChina Dragons are the regular team of the Drone Champions League, attending the DCL Races around the world. This time, the China Dragons designated four domestic pilots to participate in the Great Wall Race. Ten Chinese pilots also participated in the race as wild-card players. Competition was fierce amongst top pilots across the country, but the team finally stood out in the DCL China Wild Card Race.\n\nCompared with traditional racing, drone racing offers an epoch-making experience for pilots and audiences, since pilots, in addition to simply overcoming obstacles on the 3D track, have to \u201cfly\u201d their drones via FPV with VR goggles powered by image transmission technology, which can also be sensed by on-site and online audiences.\n\n\u201cWith the Drone Prix China in 2018, we will lay the foundation for a series of drone races in China. We see great growth in the new Sports Art, especially in the Asian market. Together with our Chinese partners, even more people can get enthusiastic about drone racing. \u201c said Herbert Weirather.",

It could be processed easily on-site to reduce ocean pollution,\" he said.\n\nBags made from PVA, a water-soluble material, are displayed at a media briefing in Santiago, Chile, in July. CLAUDIO REYES/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nNow, Astete's dream is almost a reality thanks to a new material and processing technology devised by his partner company in South China.\n\nIn late July, Astete's company Solubag SpA and Polye Materials Co, in Guangdong province, jointly launched a series of soluble shopping bags in Santiago, capital of Chile, just before the Chilean government enacted a law that banned businesses from providing customers with free plastic bags.\n\nIt takes centuries for petrochemical plastic bags to degrade in the ocean\uff0din the meantime they choke marine animals and harm the entire ecosystem.\n\nThe bag introduced by the two companies dissolves in water quickly, and Astete even drank the mixture during a press conference to endorse its safety.\n\nAccording to Chen Gang, chairman of Polyrocks Chemical Co, Polye's parent company, the bag is made from modified polyvinyl alcohol, aka PVA, which comes from natural gas or calcium carbide.\n\n\"PVA bags dissolve in water in minutes so they won't choke marine animals. The solution will not pollute water or soil,\" Chen said. \"This alternative to plastic bags is eco-friendly.\"\n\nPVA has been used in paint, glue and textile manufacturing since the 1930s, and PVA film has also been widely used for packaging in recent years.\n\nHowever, it was difficult and costly to process the material into shopping bags because of its lack of thermoplasticity (pliability when heated), said Cui Yuefei, the bag's inventor and a senior engineer with the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.\n\nCui spent years modifying PVA in laboratories and completed his experiments in 2008.

[File photo/VCG]\n\nStudy will improve development of medicines and health management\n\nA genome study of more than 140,000 people has greatly expanded China's knowledge of its vast population and ethnic groups.\n\nPrevious Chinese population studies had only involved thousands of people, mainly Han Chinese from the eastern coast.\n\nThe largest of its kind for the Chinese population to date, the study was conducted by Shenzhen-based Beijing Genomics Institute and published in the international academic journal Cell on Oct 4.\n\n\"The study is significant to the development of China's medicine and health management industry, which has relied on foreign technology and studies for a long time because we didn't have enough genome data from the Chinese population to work on,\" said Xu Xun, president of BGI Research and the study's lead author.\n\nIt discovered the genetic structure of the various ethnic groups, found six genes that display significant differences of people across latitudes, and identified the gene flow patterns between Europeans, South Asians, East Asians and Chinese.\n\nFor instance, people from the southern part of China have developed stronger immunity against malaria than those in the north, but a gene related to fatty acid metabolism has a much higher frequency in most of the northern provinces.\n\nIn addition, people in Gansu and Qinghai provinces, a key area of the Silk Road, share more similar genes with Europeans.\n\nIt also discovered new associations among Chinese between genes and conditions such as birth defects, infectious diseases and cancers.\n\nAbout 78 percent of studies in the world about the relationship of gene and diseases are based on European individuals, Xu added.\n\nThe latest data cover all 31 provincial-level administrative units in the Chinese mainland and represent Han Chinese and 36 ethnic minorities.\n\n\"In the next three years, BGI plans to further expand the database to 1 million,\" Xu said. BGI started its Million Chinese Genome Project in 2016 and Xu's study represents its first phase.\n\nGenomic study on a national level has been widely regarded as a significant factor for a nation's core competence in the biomedical field.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the leader in the field, one study of 500,000 samples has finished and another project based on a population of five million was announced earlier this month.\n\nBGI researchers admitted there is still a gap between China's genetic research and that in Europe and the United States, but they said it is narrowing.",

TSEGA/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nRenovation of the golden roof of the Potala Palace is nearly complete and is awaiting inspection by the National Cultural Heritage Administration, said the Potala Palace Management Office in the Tibet autonomous region on Wednesday.\n\nThe government has been making a significant effort to preserve Tibet's cultural relics over the past few decades, including the palace, one of three UNESCO World Heritage sites in the region.\n\nWith a history of more than 1,300 years, the Potala Palace is an invaluable asset that enriches Tibet's history, culture, art and religion.\n\nThe historical palace underwent two major renovations by the central government from 1989 to 2009 during which more than 200 million yuan ($29 million) was invested.\n\nNot only does the site receive support for renovation from the central government, but it also continues to receive renovation and preservation assistance from the regional government and the palace's management office, said Jordan, deputy head of the office.\n\nThe latest renovation of the roof was launched in April.\n\n\"More than 31 million yuan was spent during the recent renovation,\" said Jordan.\n\nThe renovated roof consists of reliquary stupas of the successive Dalai Lamas, including the fifth Dalai Lama Ngakwang Losang Gyatso, the seventh Dalai Lama Kalsang Gyatso, the eighth Dalai Lama Jampal Gyatso, the ninth Dalai Lama Lungthok Gyatso, and the roof of the Avalokitesvara Temple.\n\nThe renovated roof also has seven victory banners and four roof ornaments along its edge.\n\n\"The surface of the reliquary stupas was eroded by rainwater, and the color of the gold plating has faded over time,\" said Tashi Phuntsok, head of the office's renovation department.\n\nPhuntsok also said renovation is necessary since wooden portions of the roof are compromised from rot, pests and other natural causes.\n\nPrior to the launch of the renovation project, the office conducted a bidding process to recruit a leading construction team to carry out the challenging work. The tender was won by Tibet Chakpori Handicrafts Bronze Arts Co Ltd, a local company specializing in the production of Buddhist sculptures and monastery renovations.\n\nDophuk Tsang Tsega, head of the company, said 75 kilograms of gold was used in the renovation of the golden roof.\n\nTsega, who is the head of the region's sculpture art association, is originally from the Dophuk Tsang family, which has a rich cultural background, producing many Buddhist masters and craftsmen.\n\nHaving more than 50 craftsmen including painters, carpenters, stonemasons, copper smiths, sculptors and religious scripture carvers, the company makes bronze and golden Buddhist sculptures and religious objects.\n\nThe palace office has a renovation department that is responsible for daily preservation and maintenance work.\n\nFirst built in the seventh century by Tibet's 33rd king Songtsen Gampo, and expanded by the fifth Dalai Lama Ngakwang Losang Gyatso and his minister Desi Sangye Gyatso in the 17th century, the Potala Palace was used as the residence, administrative office and religious ritual sites of successive Dalai Lamas.\n\nTo better preserve the palace's architecture, the office allows a maximum of 5,000 visitors each day.",

[Photo by Ning Jian/For China Daily]\n\nOu Donghua, an officially appointed inheritor of Miao ethnic embroidery, a national intangible cultural heritage item, showed concern over the future of the traditional craft.\n\nGrowing up in a Miao village in southwestern Guizhou province, Ou said she wishes to pass on the skills of her people's embroidery - which can be traced back thousands of years - to future generations.\n\n\"I would like to teach anyone who wants to learn it,\" she told the People's Daily.\n\nYet nowadays, many of the young people in the village have left to work in the cities and few want to stay back to learn the skills, she said.\n\nOu was pessimistic about the cultural inheritance. \"I regularly visit Miao villages throughout a year, only to find most of them empty - as young adults work in cities and children go to school, few youngsters feel like the ancient craft.\"\n\nSilversmith Wu Shuigen from Taijing county, in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong autonomous prefecture in Guizhou, shared Ou's concern. Wu is a representative of another national intangible cultural heritage item, the Miao people's silver craftsmanship.\n\nAt the prefecture, home to nearly two million Miao people, who account for roughly 42 percent of the total population, Miao costumes are popular and silver decorations are indispensable to a Miao bride's dowry.\n\nA complete set of silver decorations in the dowry include a hat, bracelets, a collar and anklets, weighing six to nine kilograms in total.\n\nIt takes an experienced silversmith like Wu nearly two months to complete a set.\n\n\"Except for peak seasons in farming, I spend the rest of the year working silver. Even working overtime all the way, only 10 sets can be completed in a year,\" People's Daily quoted him as saying.\n\nWith the change in mindset and lifestyle, younger generations of Miao people flock to advanced metropolises and are rarely in touch with the ethnic group's traditional outfits and decorations.\n\nHaving engaged in crafting silver jewelry for 32 years, Wu has coached 18 apprentices yet many of them have quit, he said.\n\nXiang Zhaolun, vice-minister of culture and tourism, told the Beijing-headquartered newspaper that due to changes in the social environment and rapid flows of human resources, the traditions and customs of local communities and villages faced such challenges as a shortage of cultural inheritance and a reduced audience base.\n\nIncreasingly diverse information and communications and entertainment channels have also contributed to intangible cultural heritage's weakened role in education and entertainment, Xiang said.\n\nOn the other hand, the technological progress has also created opportunities for traditional craftsmanship to realize innovative development, experts said.\n\nGuizhou boasts 85 national intangible cultural heritage items, according to government data.\n\nFeng Jinguo, head of Taijiang's cultural bureau, said that both the old craftsmen and young people need communications.\n\n\"Using internet technologies to bring crafts to the market and the young generation's social networks will help the traditional culture to survive,\" Feng said.\n\nInternet giant Baidu has initiated a charity program to promote China's intangible cultural heritage.\n\nAfter analysis of data related to 150 million active online browsers on a daily basis, the program recommends content concerning intangible cultural heritage in various forms, such as videos, text and pictures, to targeted groups keen on traditional culture, according to the company.\n\nIn addition to Miao embroidery and silver jewelry making, more than 10 other intangible cultural heritage items have been promoted online, free of charge.\n\nThe program also uses virtual reality technology to demonstrate the making of woodcut illustrations and traditional kites. Shadow plays, Tibetan thangka paintings and kung fu, are also on the priority recommendation list.\n\nTo date, the program has received more than 15 million visits, according to Baidu.\n\nTian Qing, an expert on intangible cultural heritage protection, told the People's Daily that making full use of various forms of new media is key to promoting traditional culture.\n\nJust depending on the government is far from enough, Tian noted. \"We need to leverage the resources and forces from across our entire society and pool them into the promotion of the heritage.\n\n\"The internet, no doubt, plays a crucial part.\"",

  "text": "Season two of the CCTV show Nation's Greatest Treasures will soon make its debut as announced at a news conference at the Palace Museum in Beijing on Tuesday. [Photo by Zou Hong/China Daily]\n\nBefore the first season of the Nation's Greatest Treasures (previously called National Treasure) was aired last December, not many would have believed that cultural relics could create excitement on a TV variety show.\n\nBut the 10-episode show shown through China Central Television became a phenomenon.\n\nIt earned 9 points out of a total of 10 on Douban, one of China's major film and TV review websites.\n\nCCTV's statistics show that it has attracted more than 2 billion views online.\n\nA total of 27 cultural relics from nine key museums nationwide, which were recommended by the show, turned into star attractions. And the number of visitors at the nine museums during the Spring Festival holiday earlier this year increased by an average of 50 percent, compared with the same period in the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, the good news for fans of the program is that season two of the show will soon make its debut.\n\nThe announcement was made at a news conference on Tuesday at the Palace Museum in Beijing, one of the nine museums that participated in the inaugural season.\n\nThe premiere date has not been announced but it is expected to air by the end of this year.\n\nSpeaking about the program, Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, says: \"Thanks to the show, cultural relics are no more just objects that have to be admired and have no relevance in our daily lives.\n\n\"People now realize that these items not only have a brilliant past but also a contemporary significance. And understanding our traditional culture will help us embrace the future.\"\n\nIn the first season, three key exhibits from one museum were selected for a 100-minute episode. And the items were introduced by entertainment stars through short historical dramas, while behind-the-scene stories were later told by scholars and other experts.\n\nFor viewers who enjoyed the actors' emotional performances, aimed at showcasing the legends associated with the cultural relics, there is more such drama in the upcoming season.\n\nYu Lei, the director of the show, says that the unexpected success of the first season put more pressure on her.\n\n\"As modern people's tastes in entertainment change fast, we were (initially) undecided on whether to keep it (the inaugural season format) as it was or adopt a new one.\"\n\nFinally, her production team chose to keep the basic format \"unchanged\".\n\nBut Yu has introduced new elements to the show.\n\nFor instance, she says that musicals and dancing will be used in the stage drama section.\n\n\"It's better to use the advantage of the variety show format to showcase the beauty of these treasures.\"\n\nThe new season of Nation's Greatest Treasures also has 27 cultural relics from nine museums, as in the previous season.\n\nAnd the Palace Museum remains in the cast once more, but the eight provincial-level museums from the first season have been replaced.\n\nThe newcomers to the show are Hebei Museum, Shanxi Museum, Shandong Museum, Guangdong Muse-um, Sichuan Museum, Yunnan Provincial Museum, Gansu Museum and Xinjiang Museum.\n\nAs for the artifacts, Luo Xiangjun, the director of Hebei Museum, says that its Changxin Palace Lamp, a bronze oil-lamp from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24), is part of the upcoming show. The lamp was used by the imperial family and represents the highest level of craftsmanship from that time.\n\nSpeaking about Shandong Museum, Guo Sike, the deputy director, says that one artifact related to Confucius will be on the show.\n\nThe city of Qufu in Shandong is the hometown of the Chinese educator and philosopher.\n\nMany artifacts in these museums are well known.\n\nFor instance, an Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220) bronze sculpture depicting a galloping sacred horse treading on a flying phoenix, which is often mistakenly called Galloping Horse Treading on a Flying Swallow, is the signature artifact of Gansu Museum. And its representations are also used by China Tourism in its promotion material.\n\nAs for the Guangdong Museum, it has many articles salvaged from ancient shipwrecks from the days of the Maritime Silk Road.\n\nThe Xinjiang Museum, on the other hand, is famed for its well-preserved tapestries dating back 2,000 years and 4,000-year-old mummies.\n\nAll these artifacts are connected to legends and offer immense possibilities when it comes to a TV show, according to the museum administrators.\n\n\"Museum administrators' mindsets have changed. We're not only custodians of treasures, but advocates for culture. It's our duty to bring our collections to life through the media,\" says Shan.\n\nAccording to Yu, CCTV is also working with BBC World News for an international edition of the show, which will be aired through the British broadcaster.",

That future is of great concern to both of us. We agree that this discussion should be about concrete results for the inhabitants of the smaller EU and should not be bogged down in vague visions of the future.\"\n\nMerkel and Rutte also spoke about migration. \"In migration too, decisions need to be taken,\" Rutte stated.\n\n\"We strive for an integrated EU approach.

  "text": "Seoul claimed on Wednesday that it is considering lifting some of its unilateral sanctions against Pyongyang, a move seen as creating more momentum for diplomacy aimed at improving relations and defusing the nuclear crisis in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe Yonhap news agency reported that the Republic of Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said during an annual parliamentary audit of the ministry that \"a review (of the issue) is under way\".\n\nKang was responding to a question about whether the government is willing to lift the sanctions called the May 24 Measure, imposed by its previous conservative administration of Lee Myung-bak in 2010.\n\nKang indicated that the government is considering the removal of the May 24 Measure largely as a symbolic step to help improve the Seoul-Pyongyang relations.\n\n\"Many parts of the May 24 measures now duplicate with the United Nations sanctions,\" Kang said. \"As negotiations continue to improve ties between Seoul and Pyongyang and achieve denuclearization, there's a need to flexibly review lifting the measures as long as it doesn't damage the larger framework of sanctions against Pyongyang\".\n\nAnalysts said the most meaningful result from lifting the May 24 measures would be the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ships being able to travel through Jeju Strait between the ROK mainland and its southern island of Jeju again, which will save time and fuel for businesses run between the two neighbors.\n\nShi Yongming, an Asia-Pacific studies researcher at the China Institute of International Relations, noted that the recent inter-Korean engagement has given new momentum in resolving the Korean Peninsula issues and is crucial to resolving the standoff between the United States and DPRK.\n\nShi pointed out that ROK president Moon Jae-in was accompanied by ROK business leaders during his latest visit to Pyongyang. Moon and DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un also agreed to normalize operations at the Kaesong factory park and resume joint tours to the DPRK when possible, voicing optimism that the international sanctions could end and allow such projects.\n\nIf the ROK lifts its unilateral sanctions, it will have a positive effect in boosting economic exchanges between Pyongyang and Seoul, but is unlikely to persuade Washington to give up its sanctions, Shi added.\n\nAustralia and Japan on Wednesday reaffirmed their commitment to continue pressuring the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons program and enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang.\n\nYonhap said Moon has served as a mediator between Pyongyang and Washington and trying to ease relations between the two sides, as they are trying to work out the date and location of a second summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump.\n\nShi said since the first summit there has been little progress but many setbacks in US-DPRK relations. He said a single or two summits can't solve the complicated issue of denuclearization, but more importantly is that the two sides should narrow down ideological differences and be open to dialogues.\n\nAccording to a joint statement signed by Trump and Kim during their first summit held in Singapore on June 12, the US would provide a security guarantee to the DPRK in return for Pyongyang's commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.",

  "url": "https://cnn.com/style/article/jean-paul-gaultier-fashion-freak-show/index.html",
  "text": "Written by Jessica Bumpus, CNN\n\nEven incredibly successful fashion designers still have dreams. Jean Paul Gaultier, the original Parisian enfant terrible (and one-time Eurotrash presenter) was nine years old when he first had aspirations of showing his bear, Nana, all dressed up in feathers, at Folies Berg\u00e8re.\n\nSome five odd decades later and that dream finally comes true as the designer launches his first fashion revue at the legendary Paris venue: a storytelling of his life titled \"Fashion Freak Show.\"\n\nIt's a vibrant dance extravaganza that takes the viewer through the Gaultier early years in school -- when his teacher tried to embarrass him for creativity over non-conformity -- to his first forays into fashion, his debut catwalk show in the 1970s, the influential London punk scene, the 1990s dance and supermodel years, right up until today.\n\n'I still love fashion'\n\nGaultier, responsible among other things for Madonna's iconic cone corset silhouette, the enduring appeal of the Breton stripe, the sailor fashion trope that knows no bounds (even seen again on the Paris Fashion Week catwalks again this week at Chloe in knotted cord), has had quite the career.\n\n\"I still love fashion, it is my life, but I was always saying I will do a revue one day and it is that day,\" said the designer backstage before the show's premiere as dancers took to the stage to stretch it out. He recalls as child: \"I loved it [Folies Berg\u00e8re] so much that I think I wanted to do something like that -- the feathers, the glitter -- so I took my teddy bear and put some feathers on him.\"\n\nJean Paul Gaultier with his teddy bear. Credit: Laurent Seroussi\n\nThat same bear makes for the subject of the opening number in a series of tinsel tributes, busting some moves in said conical corsetry -- later on there comes a London punk sex club scene, an homage to the 1990s trend for excess, botox and all, and a semi-nude finale celebrating beauty in all of its natural forms.\n\n\"I definitely wanted to be a couturier,\" said Gaultier, who imagined the entire spectacular as a visual tableaux, teaming up with Tonie Marshall as co-director and Nile Rogers on the music to bring it all to life.\n\n\"I think truly that fashion, some people find it frivolous and, yes, it is and it's good that it is frivolous but through fashion you can do a lot of things, show a lot of things, say a lot of things, you can pretend, you can express yourself, or you can communicate through fashion what's happening in society.\"\n\nAll of which now seems especially pertinent in today's socially and politically-charged landscape. \"If you're the right designer, it's because you think, you [understand] what's happening in society and you make propositions of how society is going. I did it instinctively because I [understood] it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 7 Among the many Jean Paul Gaultier classics is the conical bra and corset, originally thought up by the designer when he didn't have a doll to play with and so created a cone bra for his teddy bear instead. Here, one of the performers from the designer's Fashion Freak Show wears one. Credit: \u00a9TS3, Photo: Boby\n\nIt's for all of these reasons that the designer has found himself working with the likes of Madonna and Boy George over the years, helping them to celebrate and define their individually iconic stage presence.\n\n\"Of course, to work with Madonna was quite fantastic, that I cannot deny because I was also a fan and she was wearing my clothes. Madonna is incredible and at the same time she was saying something I was saying about the power of the woman, so I felt in some ways close to her about that,\" says Gaultier.\n\n\u00a9TS3, Photo: Boby\n\nChurning out ideas\n\nThis isn't the designer's first foray into stage and screen -- Gaultier designed the costumes for the cult sci-fi film \"The Fifth Element,\" was co-host of the irreverent television show Eurotrash long before fellow designer Michael Kors took his mercurial turn on television as co-judge of Project Runway. And he has been perpetually referenced by designers time and again, whether it be through costume, collection or the renowned male and female forms of his perfume bottles.\n\nEssentially, if you thought you had a new idea, think again: Gaultier has most likely already beaten you to it.\n\n\"I feel proud and happy because even if it's copying it's like a reconnaissance, what I was doing before was more underground but now it is more popular so I am very happy about that,\" he acknowledges graciously.\n\nAlso charged with the title \"enfant terrible\", the designer however is reluctant to lay claim to that crown now but notes he is still one in spirit. \"I am 66 so you can't say enfant terrible. Now I'm more calm and quiet.\" Certainly, five hours before the curtain call of his life (this is a biography after all), Gaultier was, as final lighting decisions were being made, last rehearsals wrapping up, sequins sparkling and feathers a flutter backstage.\n\n\u00a9TS3, Photo: Boby\n\nAnd five decades later, Gaultier still very much has his finger on the pulse, especially given today's emphasis on equality. \"Because I was surrounded by women I was very shocked when I started out in fashion to hear for example that women were [seen as] an object -- be beautiful and shut up, even films said that.\n\nFor example, things that always shock me [are] when you see the man's jacket style on a woman and you see there is no pocket here [gestures to chest]. Why? The men have. Why? Because men have the wallet so it means something -- it means a woman knows she doesn't pay. I say yes women can also pay.\"\n\nSome might say provocateur, others enfant terrible. Or you could simply call it modern-day thinking.",

  "text": "Thomas Page , CNN Written by\n\nAmerica, fall 1968. Martin Luther King Jr., dead. Robert F. Kennedy, dead. The Vietnam War raged on, while at home racial and social inequality burned deep. From the Democratic National Convention to the streets of Baltimore, a country staggered towards a presidential election in paroxysms of violence.\n\nOn Oct. 1, a month before the vote, an unassuming indie flick called \"Night of the Living Dead\" premiered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Horror was never the same again. Directed by George A. Romero on a tiny budget, the movie told the story of an undead apocalypse gripping the US. With its taboo-breaking gore and documentary-like approach, the movie sent the modern zombie lurching into the nation's imagination, terrifying audiences and beguiling them with subtext.\n\nThe birth of the modern zombie in \"Night Of The Living Dead\" (1968). Credit: Image Ten/Shutterstock\n\nIf 1967 was defined by the Summer of Love, 1968 was the morning after the night before.\n\n\"There was a good deal of anger that the '60s didn't work,\" said Romero in 2012 , five years before his death. \"There was a bit of rage, a bit of disappointment.\"\n\n\"Night of the Living Dead\" communicated many of the nation's anxieties -- albeit unintentionally, most agree. Tom Savini and Greg Nicotero, the special effects makeup pioneers and Romero's long-time friends and collaborators, spoke to CNN in separate phone calls. They described \"coincidental\" color-blind casting and \"subliminal choices\" that resulted in ubiquitous symbolism and allegory, despite Romero having \"no political motivations.\"\n\nFocusing on a small cast of survivors who barricade themselves in a farmhouse against the zombie onslaught, the group \"for better or for worse come to represent what America is,\" said Gregory Waller, director of cinema and media studies at Indiana University, in a phone interview.\n\nInside the house, discord reigns as the nuclear family is torn apart. The young couple fly the coop, only to go up in flames. White turns on black; black turns on white. Most poignantly, Romero's young lead, played by African American actor Duane Jones, overcomes the zombies only to be shot dead by white vigilantes before the credits roll. That allegory was topical in 1968. Fifty years on, it still is.\n\nKyra Schon as a zombified daughter eating her father (Karl Hardman) in \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968). Credit: Janus Films\n\nThe zombie acted as a catalyst. But at this nascent stage, how best to read it?\n\n\"(Romero) took elements of the voodoo zombie genre that began with the RKO Val Lewton movies, mixed in some vampirism and cannibalism, and created a super strain of the undead,\" director and genre buff Edgar Wright told CNN via email.\n\nIn appearance, the zombie was nearly human, with lumbering gait, mouth agape and eyes vacant. The way to destroy them was clear (destroy the brain), as was the way they were created (zombie bite or corpse reanimation after the zombie advent).\n\nThere was no precedent, said Nicotero: \"(Romero) didn't define the rules. He invented the rules.\"\n\nDuane Jones as protagonist Ben, warding off zombies with fire. Credit: Janus Films\n\nBut the semiotics of zombies were far from concrete. Romero had created a demon that refused to explain itself and was impossible to reason with. You could never ask a zombie why. It just was. It was this blankness, said Waller, that made the zombie and the genre \"remarkably flexible.\"\n\nIn \"Night of the Living Dead,\" Romero dressed his zombies as white-collar workers and housewives in their nighties, suggesting a nation sleepwalking through a disaster. It also showed that aesthetics were vital in constructing a metaphor. The zombie form has since become a palimpsest ready to be overdrawn, and for 50 years the undead have been appropriated by every filmmaker willing to grapple with them.\n\nSo what has the zombie ravaged so far -- and where is it staggering to next?\n\n'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth' -- 'Dawn of the Dead'\n\nShortly after \"Night of the Living Dead,\" a slew of low-budget European zombie movies materialized. Few had as much to say. It took Romero himself to dig deeper into the genre, with his 1978 sequel \"Dawn of the Dead\" posing the question: Do these blank, rapacious faces also reflect something awful about ourselves?\n\n\"Dawn of the Dead\" took on class and consumerism. Beginning in an urban housing project, it showed how even during a zombie apocalypses, it was the poorest who suffered most acutely. Later, survivors hole up in a shopping mall, where zombies wander aimlessly and humans overindulge alongside them. One character describes the undead as \"pure motorized instinct.\" Another muses that \"this place was important in their lives.\"\n\n\"It's like (Romero) had read the stuff that people had written about the first movie,\" Waller speculated.\n\n\"Dawn Of The Dead\" (1978), with Savini's gray zombies. Credit: Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nSavini oversaw special effects makeup for the sequel, as well as performing stunt work and playing the anarchic biker, Blades. Romero was now using color film stock, and with hundreds of zombies on screen, there was a greater need to differentiate them from humans. So Savini made them gray, a nod to the movie's black and white predecessor.\n\n\"That kind of backfired,\" Savini said -- the crew couldn't create consistent lighting in the mall, turning zombies blue or green, but rarely ever the gray he wanted. Nonetheless, a new aesthetic had been established.\n\nSavini described his time as a US Army combat photographer in Vietnam as \"a lesson in anatomy.\" Gore popped with new clarity as he used prosthetics to mutilate faces and separate flesh from bone. \"Nobody ever said art had to be in good taste,\" Roger Ebert quipped with admiration.\n\nBy the time \"Day of the Dead\" came along in 1985, Romero had turned his creation on Reagan-era politics, dragging mad scientists and army brutes into the mire. The existential threat was something to be conditioned and educated by one camp, annihilated without prejudice by the other. Interestingly, it painted zombies in a sympathetic light, labeling humans as the more dangerous, irrational party.\n\n\"That's my masterpiece with George,\" said Savini.\n\n\"Tom really wanted to show that there had been an advance in the decline and decomposition of the zombies,\" added Nicotero, who was Savini's assistant at the time.\n\nBub in \"Day Of The Dead\" (1985). Credit: Laurel/Shutterstock\n\nEvery zombie now looked individual, a corpse wearing its own backstory. Savini said this angered some fans who expected more of the same after \"Dawn.\" But this new approach helped when shaping the most famous zombie in the Romero cannon: Bub.\n\nTrained by Richard Liberty's modern-day Frankenstein, Bub, played by Howard Sherman, learned to appreciate music, salute his military superior and fire a weapon. He demonstrated that the zombie was not beyond redemption or beyond civility. For that, Bub couldn't be \"decrepit in body,\" because \"he's becoming more human\" explained Savini. Bub, memorably, realizes his humanity by shooting his oppressor.\n\n'Fast zombies suck'\n\nSince the original \"Dead\" trilogy, Romero's grip on the zombie loosened as other filmmakers weighed in. By the early 21st century the undead were running in Danny Boyle's \"28 Days Later\" (2002) and Zack Snyder's \"Dawn of the Dead\" remake in 2004 -- much to Romero's chagrin. (\"George sold bumper stickers that said 'Fast zombies suck,'\" Savini recalled.) At the box office, meanwhile, Romero's \"Land...,\" \"Diary...\" and \"Survival of the Dead\" (2005-2009) were running to play catchup.\n\nOne title that did win critical approval was \"Shaun of the Dead\" (2004), Wright's rom-zom-com and self-declared \"valentine\" to Romero. With its nucleus of late-20s slackers, Wright said the zombie \"stand(s) in for the perils of living in your own solipsistic bubble of problems.\" But \"Shaun of the Dead\" was one of few films to resemble Romero's claustrophobic \" morality plays ,\" as he called them.\n\nCillian Murphy fleeing fast zombies in \"28 Days Later\" (2002). Credit: Peter Mountain/Shutterstock\n\n\"The dead are everywhere these days,\" Romero lamented in 2016 . \"As far as I'm concerned, I'm content to wait until sort zombies die off.\"\n\nThey haven't yet. The hit TV show \"The Walking Dead\" and spin-off \"Fear the Walking Dead,\" executive produced by Nicotero, have 12 seasons between them so far. For his own sake (and arguably the fans'), Nicotero has ensured that his writers stick to Romero's unofficial guidelines. \"I'm very fond of the rules,\" he said.\n\nEdgar Wright (left) on the set of \"Shaun Of The Dead\" (2004). Credit: Big Talk/Shutterstock\n\n\"We've never talked about where the zombie apocalypse comes from,\" he added. \"The truth of the matter is: it doesn't matter. It's not about how it started, it's about how the events reshaped the world.\"\n\nBut today of all days, it feels pertinent to ask: Is there any fresh ground left for the undead to cover? After moldering for half a century, the zombie could be forgiven for feeling dead on its feet. Wright admitted to feeling tired of the genre. \"I think we should give them a little rest so they can come clawing back in a more surprising way,\" he suggested.\n\n\"We're are now parodying ... the walking dead we have in our society, staring at phones,\" said Savini. Nicotero also compares zombies and technology, describing a virus-like spread: \"Before you know it, it's taken over.\"\n\nZombies in \"The Walking Dead\" (2010--). Credit: Gene Page/AMC/ AMC Film Holdings LLC\n\nTechnology's slow creep into our lives -- and our surrender to it -- feels ominous. If a zombie is known for anything, it's a lack of respect for personal space. So what more fitting a metaphor for the digital age?\n\nAt a time when privacy is being eroded, anonymous trolls plague online discourse and silent collectives can be whipped up to destructive ends, we lose something as we pour ourselves out onto the Internet. Too often our likes, our beliefs, our relationships and our common bonds live in cyberspace, not in flesh. The skeptic might argue our identity has been uploaded -- a set of data points to be manipulated and guided through life, directed to consume.\n\n\"Maybe there's a little zombie in all of us, eh?\" Romero teased back in 1978. Perhaps it's still true. For half a century, they have been a willing metaphor, waiting in the wings. Where the zombie turns next depends entirely on our faults. But rest assured, they will come.\n\nAs Wright said: \"You can never leave the undead buried for long.\"",

  "text": "Written by CNN Staff Shanghai, China\n\nThis story is part of \"Smart Creativity,\" a series exploring the intersection between high-concept design and advanced technology.\n\nAmid population growth and unprecedented urbanization, China's rise has been enabled by its ability to build quickly and cheaply. But meeting the country's construction demands has come at the expense of architectural identity, according to Philip Yuan, founder of the firm Archi-Union Architects.\n\n\"It's a kind of copy and paste process,\" Yuan says of the repetitive, nondescript buildings found in Chinese cities. \"It's a pity, (because by) building too fast, we lose tradition and identity of what China should be.\"\n\nInstead of producing more cookie-cutter tower blocks, the Chinese architect has been exploring experimental new approaches to construction. His techniques, which include the use of digital fabrication and robotics, could offer a new way to produce sophisticated buildings in shorter timeframes.\n\nCan robots transform Chinese architecture?\n\nTake, for instance, \"In Bamboo,\" a wooden pavilion conceived in collaboration with bamboo weavers in Daoming, Sichuan province. The project's design is not only architecturally distinctive, but also extraordinarily complex -- and only made possible through cutting-edge technology.\n\nUsing computational design based on algorithms and a pair of robotic arms rigged to \"cut like (the) two hands of a human being,\" the figure eight-shaped building was completed in just 52 days. By Yuan's estimates, it would have taken six to 12 months in China, or up to two years in the West, had traditional building methods been employed.\n\n\"Every column and every beam has a special angle and different height,\" Yuan explains. \"If you use your hand, it's impossible to make it in such a short (period of) time because every joint is different.\"\n\nThe project exemplifies the concept of \"digital tectonics,\" a phrase Archi-Union uses to express this new type of collaboration between human designers and machines. The term balances technologies and global methodologies with traditional cultures and local building techniques.\n\nFor \"In Bamboo,\" separate panels and sections were fabricated off site using local materials like timber, tiles and bamboo. They were then transported and assembled on site, helping to reduce waste and energy costs.\n\n\"In Bamboo\" is an exhibition space and cultural center in Daoming, Sichuan province. Credit: Li Han\n\nIn the case of another Archi-Union project, the Chi She Gallery in Shanghai, a robotic arm was used to lay an intricate, rippled brick facade to a level of precision unattainable by humans.\n\n\"Although the material (brick) is traditional, we can organize the form into something new,\" Yuan says of the design's abstract geometry. \"It's a collaboration between human and machine. I can teach the robotics, and it can place it precisely.\"\n\nWatch the video above for more on Archi-Union Architects.",

  "text": "Written by Sonia Kolesnikov-Jessop, CNN London\n\nIn March 2019, the United Kingdom is set to leave the European Union, and while politicians are still arguing terms for the divorce and many people disagree about the full implications of a post Brexit world for all sides, one common question among many has been: Will I be able to move as freely as before?\n\nAll passports are not equal; the rights yours offers, such as the ability to stay or even work in other countries without the hassle of first obtaining a visa, depend on the global standing of the issuing government and as such some passports are more coveted than others, and whether the new British blue passport will be seen as more or less powerful than the current EU burgundy one remains to be seen.\n\nTo make us ponder this issue and consider what the world could be like if we were global citizens, American artist Tom Sachs wants to make one of the most coveted passports in the world available to all, with a new installation called simply \"Swiss Passport Office.\"\n\nOnly Euros accepted\n\nTom Sachs, \"Swiss Passport Office\" (2018) Credit: Genevieve Hanson\n\nOn Friday, London's Galerie Thaddeus Ropac will remain open for a full 24 hours as part of Sachs' art performance. For just \u20ac20 (and after having their photo taken and answering some probing questions about education, income, and sexual promiscuity) visitors will be able to get their hands on Sachs's version of the coveted Swiss passport. No other currencies will be accepted.\n\nTom Sachs, \"Swiss Passport Office\" (2018) Credit: Genevieve Hanson\n\nWith national passports treated as the antithesis of freedom of movement across borders that Sachs regards as artificial, \"Created by governments and the corporations who control them,\" his installation is a denunciation of the enforcement of this artificiality. \"I chose the Swiss passport because it is the most prestigious and difficult to obtain. I make it available to everyone and that way, you remove some of the elitism and status of it,\" Sachs explained.\n\n\"The extended opening is really part of the performance that Tom envisaged, and the experience of coming into the installation and the process of having the Swiss passport issued will remain in a time capsule of 24 hours as a very memorable happening. It absolutely reflects how Tom always wants to make his work accessible to a broad audience,\" said Polly Robinson Gaer, executive director of Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac. After that first 24 hours, the Swiss Passport Office will remain on view until Nov. 10, but will no longer issue passports.\n\nEchoes of Brexit\n\nThe art installation is an expanded version of one that he presented at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco in 2016, the same year the British voted to leave the European Union and Americans voted to elect Donald Trump as US President, two momentous political moves that focused worldwide attention on citizenship. \"The work means much more now that these issues (which have always been there) are being brought to light through new politics and expanded media coverage,\" Sachs noted.\n\nWhile the installation encompasses various concerns about immigration and raises questions of identity and belonging, the focus is Britain's strained relationship with Europe. \"England never truly embraced the EU, by never adopting the Euro. It hedged its bets by keeping the pound. Now leaving the EU, the pendulum swings in the other direction 45 years later. It's a tragedy to see. It could be the unravelling of the European Union,\" the artist said, adding, \"But while the piece is about Brexit, it's also about xenophobia, border policies in the US and about Syria; they are all part of the same pendulum swing.\"\n\nTom Sachs, \"Swiss Passport Office\" (2018) Credit: Genevieve Hanson\n\nSachs describes himself as a sculptor who practices \"the art of bricolage\" (a French term to describe DIY and constructing something out of other things). Over the years, he's made Knoll-style office furniture out of phone books and duct tape, mixed together kitchen appliances with plywood to create a life-size home-made Apollo Lunar Excursion Module and constructed a Bonsai Tree from cotton swabs, toilet paper rolls, tampon applicators, and pregnancy tests. \"I've been inspired by makers who have been forced -- for many reasons, whether war or poverty, or simply living off the land -- to employ bricolage. My grandparents' generation was forced to make and repair with the limited resources available to them during and after the Great Depression and I maintain a connection with that ethos.\"\n\nTom Sachs, \"Swiss Passport Office\" (2018) Credit: Genevieve Hanson\n\nBut Sachs points out that the idea of bricolage is not just about making do with limited resources, \"It's the power of positive thinking: if you believe you're going to fail, you will fail, if you believe you'll succeed, you just might. Every sculpture that I make is something that I want to exist and I'm so dedicated to that desire, almost greedy for that object, that I'm willing to sacrifice my most valuable asset, my time, to realize that.\" In the case of the passport office, he said \"I'm making the world not the way it is, but the way I want it to be. I want everyone to have the most prestigious passport in the world so they can travel and trade freely.\"\n\nSwiss bliss\n\nSachs has long been fascinated by Switzerland and has referenced the country in previous works. For one of his earliest in 1996, he left a pile of stickers on the reception desk of Jeffrey Deitch's art gallery in New York with the provocative phrase 'Nuke the Swiss' printed above a red cross, which Sachs notes was a \"Surrealist-punk gesture\" and points out you can't bomb the place that holds everyone's money.\n\n\"It's really a country full of contradictions, and contradiction is what makes art great,\" he added.\n\nHe is not the first to address questions of citizenship and nationhood through the issuance of a passport. The Slovenian art collective NSK has been issuing its own-brand passports since 1992, and at the Venice Biennale last year, Tunisia had three kiosks around the Arsenale issuing a universal passport called 'Freesas' to all applicants.\n\n\"Conceptually, I like the idea of creating my own nation, but it takes too much explaining,\" he said. \"And also, Switzerland is status.\"",

  "text": "Written by Stephy Chung, CNN Hong Kong\n\nIt has been heralded as a vision of the future. A $10.75 billion infrastructure investment connecting Hong Kong with China's high-speed rail network.\n\nThe West Kowloon Station, which is set to open today, will serve as an underground terminus for an expected 80,100 passengers daily, with the rail link promising to cut the two-hour journey time between Hong Kong and the Chinese city of Guangzhou to a mere 47 minutes.\n\nBut the glittering, wave-shaped development has proven to be controversial. A future some in Hong Kong neither wanted nor asked for.\n\nCritics have lambasted the approximately 400,000 square-meter station and the Hong Kong section of the Express Rail Link, questioning the cost of the project which is 30% over the estimated budget, and pointing out that the city already has regular rail links with mainland China.\n\nBut a bigger and more contentious flashpoint has been its joint-immigration checkpoints.\n\nDue to its relatively short distance, the Hong Kong section of the Express Rail Link has a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour (kph), much lower than the top speed of 300 kph China's bullet trains usually hit. Credit: Courtesy Aedas\n\nAlthough it is part of China, Hong Kong is separated by a fixed border and governed under a separate legal framework that grants it political and legal freedoms not available on the mainland.\n\nThis \"Trojan train,\" as one political commentator put it , will cut straight into the heart of the city, where mainland immigration officers stationed at the terminus will be able to enforce Chinese law on Hong Kong soil for the first time.\n\nConcerns surrounding the Chinese government's ability to operate with impunity within the city have increased in recent years, following the alleged \"involuntary removal\" of a Hong Kong bookseller to mainland China in 2015.\n\nAs of Sunday, a part of the new station, as well as compartments of the trains traveling to and from mainland China, will come under the jurisdiction of Beijing.\n\n\"I think it's unprecedented and violates the 'one country, two systems' principle,\" said Hong Kong politician Lam Cheuk-Ting, referring to the city's unique political arrangement with Beijing.\n\n\"It will threaten the autonomy of Hong Kong,\" added Lam.\n\nDivisive architecture\n\nIn the past, the development of major infrastructure projects in Hong Kong had coincided with periods of unrest in mainland China, providing a veneer of comparative stability.\n\nThe Kowloon-Canton Railway, completed in 1912, and the first cross-harbor tunnel finished in the early 1970s, are two such examples, according to Cole Roskam, an associate professor of architectural theory and history at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe former was constructed as the Qing Dynasty in China was being overthrown, while the latter was completed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nWhereas earlier colonial-era projects \"helped to reassure the public regarding Hong Kong's future, these recent projects seem to have stoked more anxiety,\" said Roskam in an e-mail, referring to both the station and another new project, the world's longest sea-crossing bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China.\n\n\"I think it has to do with fear, resentment, and anxiety over China and perceptions of Hong Kong's diminished standing vis-a-vis China,\" said Roskam.\n\nThe station is located north of the West Kowloon Cultural District. Credit: Courtesy Aedas\n\nThe Hong Kong government, however, views the station as a more \"convenient means of cross-boundary transport\" and, more importantly, as a tool to boost the city's economic opportunities.\n\nFrank Chan, the secretary for transport and housing, called the project, \"a historic moment,\" during a press conference in August.\n\n\"It will foster commercial and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and mainland cities and enhance Hong Kong's status as a transport hub,\" said Chan.\n\nThe station has views of Hong Kong's Central skyline and Victoria Peak. Credit: Courtesy Aedas\n\nThe high-speed rail link will connect Hong Kong to 44 mainland destinations, including the capital Beijing.\n\nCharlie Xue, an author of several books on Chinese architecture, feels the completion of the West Kowloon Station and link represents progress; enabling Hong Kong to finally, \"catch up\" to the fast-pace development and GDP of mainland Chinese cities.\n\n\"Every major (Chinese) city is linked up by the high-speed rail,\" he said in a phone interview, touting the foreseeable business benefits of the terminus connecting to the mainland.\n\n\"If we don't, we will look backwards.\"\n\nWhat stations have come to symbolize\n\nThe 15-track station, with its expressive, sleek white curvature, was designed by Andrew Bromberg at Aedas\n\nSpaces like departure and arrival lounges, short- and long-haul platforms, customs and immigration facilities, have been assembled to create a larger void allowing for a more open plan with views of the city's skyline.\n\nThe station is linked to the city's metro system via footbridges and subways. Credit: Courtesy Aedas\n\nOutside, softer touches, like a grass-covered roof structure that gestures towards the nearby Victoria Harbor, are meant to be public-friendly.\n\n\"I think its quite striking, formally. It's clearly an effort to capture the dynamism of the high-speed train. There's a tautness to the overall form that captures its proximity to the water, and the way it will abruptly deposit travelers on the harbor's edge,\" said Roskam.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong government funded the terminus, its design carries noticeable similarities with modern train stations across the border -- fitting neatly into China's greater building narrative of what the high-speed rail network has come to represent.\n\nIn China, the stations are seen as signature markers of the country's progress, though as architecture expert Aric Chen points out, some are more impressive than others.\n\n\"The ones that aim to impress almost invariably have, in their design, a soaring space and dynamic movement,\" said Chen, who until recently was the lead curator of architecture and design at Hong Kong museum M+.\n\nThe mammoth Guangzhou South Railway Station , for instance, is three times the size of London's King Cross Station. One of the most prominent features is an arched central spine that floods the station with natural light.\n\nThe Beijing South Railway Station , which opened in 2008 to coincide with the country's transformative Summer Olympics, boasts a clean, ultra-modern elliptical geometry that caters to the passenger flow.\n\n'Excitement of technology'\n\nChina began constructing its high-speed rail in earnest, back in 2008. In just a decade since, 15,500 miles of track have been laid, making it the world's most extensive high-speed rail network.\n\nAn estimated 4 million passengers commute on some 4,000 bullet trains daily, according to China Railway\n\nHundreds of newly built or refurbished stations have been opened to accommodate the high-speed lines. Station designs often try to \"express the excitement of technology, or the speed of travel,\" according to Chen.\n\nConstruction of the project. Credit: Andrew Bromberg at Aedas\n\n\"And in that sense, (what the stations are) embodying is not just technological, but the sort of economic aspirations of the country too. These stations are the entry points for a network that is literally tying the country together in a way it hasn't been tied before.\"\n\nModern day high-speed rail stations are a unique building type, often-colossal spaces that have to account for advanced tech and subsequent electricity needs, and designed to accommodate for buses, underground metros and street vehicles.\n\nThe grass-covered roof of the station will be a pedestrian-friendly park. Credit: Andrew Bromberg at Aedas\n\n\"In terms of stations, they become what train stations used to be. They become these symbolic gateways to these rapidly developing cities, linking them together,\" said Chen.\n\nAuthor Charlie Xue likens their functionality to that of airport terminals.\n\n\"In many cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai, the stations have more than 20 lines, and are all elevated. The design relates to the complicated technology of these trains, the trains (moving) in and out, and the circulation of people.\n\n\"Trains have always been an important in China. People physically and psychologically rely on them,\" Xue added.\n\n\"During the Chinese New Year, you see hundreds of millions of people gathering at stations, moving by trains. In China, a station can decide a city's destiny.\"",

  "text": "Written by Alice Pfeiffer, CNN\n\nEach season, Paris Fashion Week closes a four-week marathon, suggesting future trends and providing an important look into France's cultural psyche. Since fashion is one of the country's most profitable industries (France is home to the LVMH and Kering luxury groups, and fashion attracts valuable tourist dollars), it is a reliable social mirror, reflecting the nation's politics and priorities.\n\nSo it's no surprise that this season offered the usual blend of pretty clothes, subtle politics and strong statements. Here were some of the key discussions from the Spring-Summer 2019 shows.\n\nThe end of an era\n\nCeline Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHedi Slimane's first collection as creative director of Celine was bound to be a controversial one. Slimane, known for a rock 'n' roll aesthetic that prioritizes youth and skinniness (which he championed while at Dior Homme and Saint Laurent), was replacing Phoebe Philo, a slick minimalist who created sophisticated, easy clothes designed with grown women in mind.\n\nSo it was no surprise, then, when Slimane sent out his usual wave-inspired tapered suits, babydoll mini dresses and bold leather looks. But still, fashion insiders and Celine devotees couldn't help but mourn the loss of a certain aesthetic that so many aspired to.\n\nIn the New York Times, fashion critic Vanessa Friedman put it succinctly : To those who, upon hearing of Slimane's appointment, \"feared that the days when this brand defined what it meant to be a smart, adult, self-sufficient, ambitious and elegantly neurotic woman were at an end -- you were right.\"\n\nAppreciation trumps appropriation\n\nKoche Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: BERTRAND GUAY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrance has an especially problematic fashion history, one heavily interspersed with remnants of its horrific colonial past. The word \"n\u00e8gre,\" which is used as an anti-black racial slur, is still used to designate a shade of grey, and designers continue to produce collections around stereotypical, non-specific African or \"Oriental\" themes. However, a new generation of designers is presenting a more multicultural definition of Gallic chic, in a respectful -- and highly political -- manner.\n\nTake Christine Phung, creative director of Leonard Paris, who found her influences in the Maasai tribes of Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nAdding a layer of authenticity to her collection, she collaborated with Maasai artisans to produce a series of traditional earrings and necklaces. Elsewhere, veiled model Feriel Moulai walked the Koch\u00e9 runway in a finely embroidered hijab and matching top. This was a bold move in a country that has passed a law banning face-covering garments, including niqabs and burkas, in public. (And remember the burkini fiasco of 2016?)\n\nAt Balmain, Olivier Rousteing , one of the few black designers leading a major fashion house, showed a collection that celebrated the visual impact of Egypt on the French capital (such as the Louvre Pyramid by Chinese architect I.M. Pei), suggesting that Parisian aesthetics owe more to other cultures than one might think.\n\nBalmain Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nSpeaking 'Franglais' in the shadow of Brexit\n\nSavile Row tailoring met couture finesse at Givenchy, the Paris-based house helmed by British designer Clare Waight Keller . The lines, straddling gar\u00e7onne chic and dandyism, could certainly be read as a sartorial rebellion against Brexit. This feeling also pervaded the fusion of London boho chic and French bobo (bourgeois-boh\u00e8me) at Loewe, the Spanish house owned by French luxury group LVMH and designed by Northern Irishman Jonathan Anderson.\n\nGivenchy Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: Dominique Charriau/WireImage/WireImage\n\nSome, including Vogue critic Sarah Mower, also detected a sense of Brexit malaise at London brand Marques'Almeida's Resort 2019 collection, shown in Paris for the first time. Portuguese founders Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida played a soundtrack of traditional Fado music, which often riffs on themes of loss, resignation and melancholy.\n\nReacting to Macron's entrepreneur obsession\n\nTo many, French President Emmanuel Macron's aggressively capitalist views clash with the country's traditional socialist persuasions. To fight back, a number of small brands are working toward a slower, less competitive fashion world.\n\nAbout a Worker is a label with no creative director, where each piece is made by a single textile worker. Its show this week consisted of a public street performance followed by a discussion about inclusivity and sustainability. Speaking over the phone, founder Kim Hou said this was \"a sign of resistance against our individualistic consumer culture that pushes you to compete rather than (cooperate).\"\n\nCasa93, France's first free fashion school, paired up with Manifeste011, a vegan concept store, to present a collection designed by students using recycled textiles. \"We need to work horizontally to resist the irresponsible capitalist culture that has become a norm,\" Nadine Gonzales, the university's founder, said in a phone interview.\n\nDressing after 'Balance ton Porc'\n\nAs women in the English-speaking world rallied behind the #MeToo movement, the French incarnation, \"Balance ton Porc\" (rat out your pig), was faced with harsh criticism from unexpected sources. Earlier this year, a number of key cultural figures, including Catherine Deneuve and author Catherine Millet, signed an open letter in the newspaper Le Monde, defending men's \"freedom to pester\" women.\n\nMugler Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nBut on the runway, fashion has made it its business to support the movement's message of strength and solidarity, albeit subtly. Think modernized \"power wear,\" as Mugler's Casey Cadwallader put it.\n\nFor his first collection at the house, he decided to reinterpret founder Thierry Mugler's fearless femininity: \"Monsieur Mugler showed his support (for) women by creating blazers with large shoulder pads. Today this means making clothing with a sense of shielding, empowerment, self-expression,\" he said in a phone interview.\n\nOff-White Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: FRANCOIS GUILLOT/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd at Off-White, Virgil Abloh, recently appointed head of menswear at Louis Vuitton, cast eight athletes to walk the track-inspired runway, providing a striking visual alternative to the omnipresent waif.",

  "text": "Written by Hilary Clarke London\n\nThe auction house says it didn't know anything about it. The artist famously doesn't like to show his face. The buyer is a mystery. So, for that matter, is the seller.\n\nIn the case of the \"self-destructing Banksy,\" nothing adds up.\n\nThe startling stunt at Sotheby's in London on Friday has set the art world aflame. The image of a girl reaching out for a red, heart-shaped balloon had just sold for $1.4 million.\n\nMoments later, a shredder hidden inside the picture frame began to whirr, the canvas slid down, and at least part of it ended up in strips.\n\nSotheby's claimed it had been \"Banksy'd.\"\n\nThe British street artist, famous for being faceless, is certainly well known for his stunts. In 2006 he secretly erected a life-size replica of a hooded Guantanamo Bay detainee inside a ride in the California Disneyland theme park. In 2013 he set up a stall selling his original artwork for $60 in a New York market and filmed people passing by, convinced that because of the price, the works were fake.\n\nOn Saturday, Banksy published a video on Instagram that purported to show how he built a paper shredder into the frame of the 2006 painting \"Girl with a Balloon.\"\n\n\"The urge to destroy is also a creative urge,\" Banksy wrote, citing Picasso.\n\nBut the video didn't answer everyone's questions -- not least about the involvement of the auction house.\n\n\"I wouldn't put it past Banksy to have staged the whole thing, and I wouldn't put it past him to have pulled this off without anyone being on it,\" Brooklyn based street art curator RJ Rushmore told CNN. \"But whatever the 'truth' is doesn't change the performance for me.\"\n\nWas Banksy in the room during the auction?\n\nThere is speculation that Banksy, who has kept his identity hidden for more than 20 years, may have been in the room at the time of the sale, possibly overseeing the whole performance while filming on his phone.\n\nFootage circulating on the internet shows a middle-aged man, wearing thick-rimmed black glasses, filming the moment when the picture is shredded.\n\nShortly after, a man is seen being escorted out of the room.\n\nWas that Banksy?\n\nIn 2016, scientists at Queen Mary's University in London used geographic profiling, based on the artist's movements, to identify him as a man called Robin Gunningham.\n\nThe authors conceded that their study fell short of definitive proof.\n\nThe man spotted at Friday's auction bears similarities to Gunningham, leaving internet and art sleuths to suggest it was him.\n\nThe angle from which the man was filming could also correspond to the angle used in Banksy's video version of events.\n\nBanksy is known for having tight-lipped collaborators who work with him, and it is also possible he had people placed in the room to record the event.\n\nErika Rossi, a gallery owner from Italy, who was at the auction, said there was a young man who had been diligently filming throughout who sat in front of her. She also saw a man \"arguing with security\" after the auction had finished.\n\nSotheby's says it wasn't in on the stunt\n\nIs it really credible that Banksy would give the painting away with an embedded, remote-controlled, battery-operated shredder, that would activate 12 years later? At the very least, wouldn't the battery have gone flat?\n\nCommentators also pointed out that Sotheby's staff casually remove the painting after it had acted so strangely. Weren't they afraid of sharp blades reactivating, or of it exploding? In addition, the frame was extremely thick and the shredder would have added weight. Weren't they curious as to why it was so heavy?\n\nIn a statement, Sotheby's said, \"It is increasingly common in the contemporary art world for artists to deem their frames integral to the artwork, as was the case in this instance. The certificate from the artist's studio for the present work states that the frame is 'integral to the piece.'\"\n\n\"When Sotheby's asked the studio about removing the work from its frame during the cataloguing process, we were expressly told not to remove the frame. This is not unusual -- consider Lucio Fontana's lacquer frames, or George Condo's frames that include labels on the back saying do not remove from frame. In many cases, if you remove the frame you violate the artist's wishes and destroy the artwork,\" the statement added.\n\nExperts also wondered why the marquee work was the final lot in the sale. Ordinarily, such a high-profile sale would have come higher up in the running order.\n\n\"The big question is -- was Sotheby's complicit,\" asks Anny Shaw, correspondent for the Art Newspaper, who was in the room for the sale. \"Are these signs that they knew? The lower estimate, putting the lot at the very end of the auction.\"\n\n\"If they weren't in on it, this probably one of the best art pranks of the century,\" Shaw told CNN. \"Banksy has really pulled off a corker. If they were in on it, it raises all sorts of questions about the manipulation of the market and it dilutes Banksy's brand. I'd be really disappointed if that's the case.\"\n\nSotheby's insists it had no idea about the stunt. \"We had no prior knowledge of this event and were not in any way involved,\" Sotheby's said.\n\nWill the painting go up or down in value?\n\nOne thing is for sure, the painting may be \"damaged\" but the art event will go down in art history, and the price may soar as a result.\n\n\"I'm unsure if the painting is going to be more valuable or less valuable, but it is definitely going to be his most famous,\" Banksy's former gallery owner Steve Lazarides told CNN.\n\n\"You could argue that the work is now more valuable,\" said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's head of contemporary art, Europe.\n\n\"It's certainly the first work to be spontaneously shredded as an auction ends.\"\n\nSotheby's said it was talking to the seller, \"who was surprised about the story,\" about how to proceed.\n\n\"Millionaire sells a painting for a million to other millionaires then destroys it,\" wrote fellow street artist and Banksy friend Ben Eine, known globally for his bold letters, in an Instagram post. \"You are going to have to explain this one to me?!?\"",

  "text": "Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written by\n\nThere's a memorable picture of Donna Gottschalk that is circulated in some corners of the internet. In the photo, taken by photojournalist Diana Davies at 1970 Christopher Street Liberation Day parade in New York (America's first gay pride parade), she is blonde, short-haired, 20, and carrying a sign of her own design that reads \"I am your worst fear I am your best fantasy.\" Her expression is defiant.\n\nWhen this photo was taken, Gottschalk was just beginning her own photographic practice. In the decades that followed, she would focus her lens on pockets of the lesbian community that were often ignored by the masses, from radical organizers in New York and lesbian separatists in San Francisco, to a rural commune in Maine.\n\n\"Donna and Joan, E. 9th St.\" (1970) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk\n\nThough she was born and raised on New York's Lower East Side and studied art at the prestigious Cooper Union in the 1960s, she was far removed from the glamorous queer-friendly enclaves the mainstream lapped up. You wouldn't find her at Andy Warhol's tabloid-feeding Factory; the Chelsea Hotel, where the likes of Robert Mapplethorpe, William Burroughs and Gore Vidal worked and played; or the lofty private parties where closeted women led their double-lives.\n\n\"The people that I was taking pictures of were not people that, ordinarily, people thought to photograph. They were my personal friends and family,\" she said on the phone from her Victory, Vermont farm, where she lives with her long-term partner. Though she left New York for good in 1979, her accent is thick.\n\n\"Helaine on her girlfriend's lap, Provincetown\" (1974) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk\n\nWhile some of her friends would go on to some form of notoriety (award-winning documentary photographer Joan E. Biren is a longtime friend; so is the poet Judy Grahn), many lived their lives on the margins of the margins. They were poor, transgender, homeless; sex workers, addicts, survivors of abuse. In Gottschalk's intimate portraits, taken in bedrooms, kitchens and yards, they're given a beauty in humanity they were otherwise denied.\n\n\"Chris Jimenez and Their Dog, Queens\" (1969) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk\n\nShe traces her inspiration back to Diane Arbus, Irving Penn and August Sander, \"the masters that were intrigued by portraiture of people -- real portraiture, not commercial photography. You know, they didn't set up a shop and say come in here and we'll make it look good and take your portrait.\"\n\nLike them, she was drawn to marginalized groups, and prioritized personality over artifice. But sharing her work with the public, as her idols did, was never her primary intention. (There was one group show at the Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco in the early '70s, but \"nothing ever came of that.\") Instead, she wanted to create personal keepsakes. She'd tell sitters suspicious of her camera: \"If I get to be old, I want to remember you. I want to remember you just the way you are now.\"\n\n\"Katz in the Big Chair, San Francisco\" (1972) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk/The Leslie-Lohman Museum\n\n\"I had a portent that most of the people that I was taking pictures of wouldn't live, wouldn't make it. They were poor. There were no safety nets,\" she explained. \"At the time, in the 1970s, (my work) wasn't happy-happy stuff. It wasn't what people wanted, I think, or needed. The lesbian community needed to see (that) we're not all miserable; you can thrive.\"\n\n\"Marlene Resting with a Beer, Oregon\" (1974) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk\n\nBut now, whatever her original plans, she's been given her first solo show, \"Brave, Beautiful Outlaws: The Photographs of Donna Gottschalk\" at New York's Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art. The exhibition includes 37 photos, selected with curator Deborah Bright, and the museum has acquired 10 for their permanent collection.\n\n\"Alfie in Mary's Dress Age 16\" (1974) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk/The Leslie-Lohman Museum\n\nGottschalk said it was timing more than anything that convinced her to take the risk after all these years. She says most of the people she photographed are dead. Many died young and broke. Also, \"I'm almost 69, you know, and I didn't know what the heck would happen to (my archive). I'm getting up there.\"\n\n\"Katz in the big chair, San Francisco\" (1972) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk/The Leslie-Lohman Museum\n\nThe interest in her work, including coverage in the New York Times, W magazine and Wallpaper, has her \"completely floored.\"\n\n\"I'm very happy, very much so, because many of the people who are photographed in that show... these are people who just disappear,\" she said. \"And I am so happy that they're going to be in a museum for the rest of the time that the museum exists.\"\n\n\"Sleepers, Limerick, Pennsylvania\" (1970) Credit: Courtesy Donna Gottschalk/The Leslie-Lohman Museum\n\nTop image: \"Self-portrait in Maine\" (1976) Donna Gottschalk",

  "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nA collection of British royal portraits, some of which have never been shown outside the UK, has gone on display at a US museum.\n\nThe exhibition, which opened Sunday at Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, charts how the royal family has been depicted over the last five centuries -- from Tudor portraits to recent photographs of Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nThe survey of 150 images and objects was created in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery in London, which lent a large number of the works on display, according to the exhibition's co-curator David Bomford.\n\n\"The monarchs are the history of the country, and what they achieved -- or what they failed to achieve -- is the story of the nation,\" said in a phone interview Bomford, who also serves as chair of the Department of Conservation at the UK's National Gallery.\n\n\"(The exhibition is) about character and personality, and what these monarchs were like as human beings. We're trying to cover the personal, the political and the historical.\"\n\nFrom Tudors to Windsors\n\nThe exhibition begins with the House of Tudor in the late 15th century, a period in which the monarchy's modern portrait tradition was born.\n\n\"Before that, royal portraits were not realistic, they were just generic depictions of majesty,\" Bomford said. \"But with the Tudors we begin to get accurate portraits -- actual likenesses of real people.\"\n\nAccurate perhaps, but still subject to exaggeration. Among the exhibition's early images is an iconic painting of Henry VIII, by the renowned German artist Hans Holbein the Younger, in which the king's physical presence and intimidating expression are deliberate projections of power. Such images were created in the knowledge that they would be be copied and distributed around the land.\n\nPortrayals of Henry's daughter, Elizabeth I, present a comparable, though altogether different form of propaganda: one that reinforced the idea of her as a \"Virgin Queen.\"\n\n\"She never married a person -- she married the country,\" Bomford said. \"And so she's depicted in white clothing because she's the bride of her nation. There's a huge amount of propaganda going on.\"\n\nChanging depictions\n\nAlthough many of the pictures on display were commissioned and released by the royal houses of their day, the Houston exhibition also includes independent artworks, like Andy Warhol's pop-art depiction of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nTheir inclusion is a reminder that monarchs, princes and princesses no longer enjoy a monopoly over how they are portrayed.\n\nThis process began, according to Bomford, with the invention of photography, which left less room for artists' imaginations. But these photo portraits nonetheless offer insight into the times and are illustrative of how royalty wanted to be publicly received.\n\n\"The family of Queen Victoria and (her husband) Prince Albert was the first royal family that was recorded in photographs, and Albert encouraged the taking of informal photographs,\" he said.\n\n\"But he wanted to show that they were just like any other family in the country, a sort of middle class concept of a family, and he deliberately manipulated the photographs -- or what they recorded -- to give this impression.\"\n\nPhotography dominates the modern portion of the exhibition, which includes images of Edward VII, George V and Edward VIII, who abdicated in 1936. A recent photo of Queen Elizabeth II by Annie Leibovitz, and an iconic image of Princess Diana by British photographer Terence Donovan, also feature in the show.\n\nYet, these too should be considered in the context of how and why they were created.\n\n\"All royal portraits (are propaganda) to some extent,\" Bomford added.",

  "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nWith proud, wistful expressions, the elderly figures in Peter Bos' portraits seem gentle enough -- kind, even. But the men's tattoos belie a darker truth: They were once fearsome headhunters whose facial markings symbolize the decapitation of their foes.\n\nThese are members of the Konyak tribe, a group of approximately 230,000 people living in the Indian state of Nagaland, close to the Myanmar border. Inhabiting remote hilltop villages, these agricultural communities often used patterned body markings to celebrate major milestones and rites of passage.\n\nFace tattoos, however, were reserved for warriors -- specifically those returning from conflicts or raids with enemy heads.\n\n\"I never felt intimidated or threatened -- they were very warm,\" recalled Bos, a Dutch portrait photographer, in a phone interview. \"We think of headhunting as something evil or rough, but for them it was more just a way of living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 17 Peter Bos shot a series of portraits depicting Nagaland's headhunters. The images are featured in book, \"The Konyaks: Last of The Tattooed Headhunters.\" Scroll through the gallery to see more images from the project. Credit: Peter Bos\n\n\"We went into their houses, spent time with them and asked about their past -- about their poems, sayings and songs -- which made it easier for them to feel relaxed in front of the camera,\" said Bos, who shot the aging headhunters over four visits to the region.\n\n\"But the old men were very fragile, and had a sadness in them.\"\n\nThe tribesmen's body art is slowly fading from sight, both literally and figuratively. Since Christian missionaries arrived in the region during the second half of the 19th century, headhunting and the accompanying tattoo ritual have been gradually consigned to history.\n\nBoth practices were effectively eliminated by the 1970s, according to Phejin Konyak, the great-granddaughter of a headhunter, who has spent almost four years documenting her tribe's disappearing culture.\n\nNinety-eight-year-old headhunter, Chen-o Khuzuthrupa. Credit: Peter Bos\n\n\"Every tattoo pattern depicts someone's status or cycle of life,\" the 38-year-old said in a phone interview from Nagaland. \"What I did was record all of the existing patterns, so they are not lost. (I also documented) the oral traditions, like songs and poems, to capture them at a moment when it's all vanishing.\n\n\"These people are the last bearers of this tradition, and when they die it will be gone forever.\"\n\nA 'living library'\n\nKonyak's research -- which includes illustrations of tattoo designs and their meanings -- appears alongside Bos' photographs in the pair's new book, \"The Konyaks: Last of The Tattooed Headhunters.\" The work also details the tribe's customs, rituals and social structures, charting the arrival of British missionaries and the disappearance of animist beliefs and shamanism.\n\nThe author's personal history informs her self-professed \"mixed feelings\" toward Christianity. Having left her 700-person village at the age of 4, Konyak was educated at a convent school in Dimapur, almost 300 kilometers away.\n\nThe patterns used for facial tattoos vary between different Nagaland villages. Credit: Peter Bos\n\n\"Of course, it brought us education -- and I wouldn't have written this book if I didn't get a modern education,\" she said. \"But in Nagaland the conversion to Christianity and the exposure to modernity has been very rapid. It just happened suddenly. We've gone from headhunting to iPads in the span of a few (decades).\"\n\nThere is a certain irony to Konyak's mission: Her great-grandfather, Ahon, reportedly helped end headhunting by working with the British to broker peace between warring tribes. But while the author welcomes the end of a violent practice, she fears that much else has also been swept away.\n\nThe fate of traditional tattoos, which were hand-tapped into the skin using sharpened rattan canes and tree sap pigment, is symptomatic of a wider cultural erosion, Konyak said.\n\n\"Even old folk songs ... are seen as nothing important,\" she added. \"If only we could take the good things of the past and mix them with the new lifestyle.\n\n\"I think there should be a balance. We cannot remain isolated; we have to adapt to changing times. But if we lose our identity, then what's the purpose?\"\n\nSome of Bos' subjects assumed traditional clothing, while others are pictured wearing sportswear or modern accessories. Credit: Peter Bos\n\nKonyak believes that there is \"no chance\" of her tribe's lost traditions being revived, though she sees value in recording what she describes as a \"living library.\" In addition to producing an illustrated children's version of the book, she is having her work translated into one of the tribe's dialects (although because the Konyaks' languages have no written form, this means painstakingly transliterating an oral dialect into Latin script).\n\n\"Preservation has to come internally, from within the local population,\" she said. \"Unless there's a drive from within the tribe, then there's little chance of (traditions surviving).\"\n\nContrasting worlds\n\nFor Bos, the juxtaposition of old and new provided rich visual material. Many of his subjects assumed traditional clothing -- even inserting antlers or tusks into their ears -- while others are pictured wearing sportswear or modern accessories.\n\nThe portraits were often shot inside traditional longhouses, which are made from bamboo, palm leaves and wood from the surrounding hills.\n\nBos captured many of the headhunters inside their traditional longhouses. Credit: Peter Bos\n\n\"Their longhouses are very beautiful,\" he said. \"They're very dark inside, but they all have this hunting-trophy wall with all the skulls of animals. They keep all of the heads, apart from the (old) human ones that are not allowed by the church anymore. And the bamboo structures just make for a beautiful backdrop.\"\n\nBos also captured everyday life in the region's villages, which he visited for up to six weeks at a time. But it's his portraits -- which include his collaborator's own great-aunt and great-uncle -- that seem to embody the spirit of the book.\n\n\"They were still alive, but time had caught up with them,\" he said of the elderly villagers.\n\n\"They were not really of this world anymore.\"",

She often depicts her subjects as powerless beings in the great wilderness or society at large.\n\nPark, who is also based in Seoul, attributes the rise of \"honjok\" to the social pressures of the modern age, namely limited opportunities to interact with others and a lack of time to dedicate to oneself.\n\n\"The society we live in can be very unstable, and I think young people don't want to be compromised anymore,\" she said in an email interview.\n\nRedefining the family\n\nThere were over 5 million single-person households in South Korea as of 2016, accounting for almost 28% of the total number of households, according to the Korean Statistical Information Service . For Michael Breen , author of the book \"The New Koreans: The Story of a Nation,\" this development is at odds with the historical traditions of Korean society.\n\n\"I think it is a natural consequence of democracy and economic development,\" he said in a phone interview. \"In a lot of Asian societies, individual interests and rights have been subordinated to those of family or group organizations.

Women, in particular, are moving away from traditional notions of family and the perceived burden of raising children, Breen said.\n\n\"With the (prospect of) added pressure from the in-laws, a lot of women opt out from the idea of marriage,\" he said.\n\nA private view of a Sotheby's auction with T.O.P.\n\nThe growth of individualism can be a source of contentment, according to Jang Jae Young, manager of a website dedicated to the single lifestyle, honjok.me\n\n\"Our parents' generation was busy putting bread on the table,\" he said in an email interview. \"They had to sacrifice themselves to feed their families and contribute to the economy.\n\n\"But now there is a stronger desire for self-realization and happiness, even if that means being alone.\"\n\nChanging priorities\n\nAlthough Ahn's photographs portray a palpable loneliness, she believes that her contemporaries are more willing to enrich their lives through experiences like travel.\n\n\"In our parents' generation, people knew that after working hard and saving up for certain number of years, they would be able to buy a house for their family,\" she said.\n\n\"But we came to a realization that we'll never be able to own anything like that, even if we work for our entire lives.\n\n\"(My peers) know that there is no happily-ever-after, and they are responding to life in a wiser way.

It could be everything from a simple online ad through to package delivery service employees that we work with because they're in everyone's garage or even a couple of firemen so they kind of know what's hiding here and there, and then we pay a finder's fee to them we bring the vehicle here.\"\n\nIcon\n\nThis process takes anywhere from 72 hours to two years, and there have even been times where the search had to be abandoned.\n\nTo achieve the results Ward so meticulously desires, his technicians and engineers have to employ some pretty unique processes. On the shop floor you'll see everything from aerospace machinery used in the early 1900s for the military, up to the latest in laser technology.\n\nIcon\n\nThe result looks like it could have been found in a barn (which it probably was), but on closer inspection every element has been carefully designed and selected to achieve both a uniform aesthetic but also the complete modern driving experience. Imagine a rusty, vintage Thriftmaster pickup truck that drives as fast as a sportscar.\n\nIt's a somewhat radical concept in the luxury car industry. \"A lot of people look at the Derelict projects and go, 'Why on earth would anyone spend all that time and money on something that looks, pretty bad?\" So not everyone gets it,\" Ward mused.\n\nIcon\n\nEach year, Icon delivers about 250 vehicles, but the Derelicts are the most rarefied. They only produce around three or four a year so, in total, they have delivered just under two dozen.\n\n\"The business model of building the Derelicts is pretty darn stupid. At the end of the year we're lucky to break even on them,\" he admitted.\n\n\"We are constantly riding the knife's edge on a design and engineering perspective. Trying to make sure we don't do anything that negates the on road capability while balancing decisions that could hurt the design aesthetic. That is the art form of what we're doing.\"\n\nWatch the video above to find out more.",

Click here for more.\n\nAt the height of World War II, the US military commissioned Kodak to produce a new type of color film that could capture infrared waves invisible to the human eye. The resulting photographs, taken during aerial reconnaissance missions, allowed allied forces to distinguish between foliage and the enemy camouflage it concealed.\n\nNow, more than seven decades on, photographic artist Lynda Laird has used precisely the same technology to retell one of the conflict's defining episodes.\n\nHer images of abandoned bunkers were taken along the Normandy coast, where the D-Day landings took place in June 1944. Because vegetation reflects a large amount of infrared, the leaves, grass and bushes in her photographs appeared bright red when the film was developed.\n\nBut while the colors evoke images of violence and bloodshed, it was the history of this photographic technique that initially inspired the idea.\n\nCourtesy Lynda Laird\n\n\"I didn't know what was going to happen with the film,\" said Laird during a phone interview. \"It's very variable, and depends on which filters you choose. Sometimes it's much pinker, sometimes the colors are more yellow -- I didn't know until I got the film back and (thought) 'wow, the reds do really feel like blood, and it's quite aggressive.'\n\n\"For me, that's why it works quite well. But that wasn't the plan. It was much more about the film being relevant to the work.\"\n\nThe deep shades of red offer a stark visual contrast to the grey concrete structures and blue skies behind them. Another powerful juxtaposition is created between the stillness of the scenes Laird captures and the horrors that once unfolded around them.\n\n\"They were really peaceful and tranquil,\" the 36-year-old said. \"A lot of the bunkers have become part of the landscape, in that there are plants growing all over them. Some of them are really still quite brutal, but even the ones that are on the beach are sinking into the sand -- it's like nature has taken them over.\"\n\nA ground-level history of war\n\nThe infrared photographs form part of a wider multimedia project that revisits Operation Overlord, the code name used for the Battle of Normandy. Commissioned by the town of Deauville, a seaside resort occupied by the Nazis during the war, Laird's \"Dans Le Noir\" (or \"In the Dark\") also features maps and videos.\n\nCourtesy Lynda Laird\n\nAt the center of Laird's story is a series of diary extracts written by Odette Brefort, a member of the French resistance who lived in Deauville during the war.\n\n\"Since midnight it's been impossible to sleep: the humming from planes, the anti-aircraft bombs, the machine gun noise,\" Brefort wrote in one diary entry. \"I went downstairs because I couldn't sleep and after 15 minutes it went quiet. Thinking it would be better, I went back to bed. What a mistake!\"\n\nShe goes on to describe the \"deafening\" fighting that took place, before a power cut plunged Deauville into darkness. Laird presents the diary extracts alongside elaborate maps that Brefort made for fellow members of the resistance detailing the location of enemy forces.\n\n\"When we remember (the war), we look at soldiers and people who fought,\" Laird said, \"and it's often missed that people were living through it -- what role they took on and the impact it had on them.\"\n\nCourtesy Lynda Laird\n\nLaird's project includes a series of videos shot in the seas off Normandy at the exact time of day the landings took place, her lens partially submerged by the water. The Scottish photographer has collected sand and seawater from the area for a future installation, and she hopes to create new sound recordings in time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day next year.\n\n\"Photography was my starting point, but now I go out and record sounds first,\" said Laird. \"I do a lot of research and I read a lot of archives, (which are) really important to my practice.\n\n\"A lot of my work is to do with memory and a sense of place, trying to look at what's invisible in a landscape -- what you can feel and what you can sense.\"",

  "text": "Written by Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN Marseille, France Contributors Emir Eralp & Ana Rosado, CNN\n\nThe Calanque de Sormiou beach, a beautiful cove at the bottom of a winding descent through a nature reserve near Marseille, is where French fashion designer Simon Porte Jacquemus chose to debut his first menswear collection to the world.\n\nStaged on the sand inches away from gently lapping water during magic hour on a June evening, guests were assigned beach towels to sit on or directed toward large rocks to clamber up onto for a view of the show. The front row was jagged, unkempt and hardly policed in the way that a traditional front row in Paris or London might be. The Mediterranean Sea stretched out beyond the runway, providing a perfectly blue backdrop.\n\nA model in Jacquemus menswear. Credit: BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhy Jacquemus chose to present his collection in such a stunning location wasn't difficult to interpret. When asked, he confirmed he was looking for paradise but also somewhere that was accessible. \"This is not a luxury resort or anything like this, it's just a paradise for everyone,\" he said.\n\nThe atmosphere was remarkably relaxed and utterly different to the feel of a traditional Paris Fashion Week catwalk presentation. Shoes were removed, people smoked cigarettes and ate ice cream as they waited for the show to begin. Children swam nearby, refreshingly unaware of getting in photographers' shots.\n\n'The little brother of the Jacquemus woman'\n\nTo some, it might have seemed risky to show your first menswear collection so far from the center of activity in the capital, but Jacquemus seemed firm. \"There's no sensuality in Paris, to me, so that's why I've brought people here.\"\n\nA model in Jacquemus menswear. Credit: BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter presenting La Bomba (he names all of his collections) during the Paris shows in September, his celebration of confident and sophisticated female sensuality was secured, and the imagery of barely there dresses and figure-celebrating silhouettes was still vivid in our minds.\n\nSo the expectation was that he would present an equally sexy male character during his debut. But there was a difference. According to Jacquemus, the man he presented was \"more like the little brother of the Jacquemus woman. ... He's just starting; he's still very young.\"\n\nA look from Jacquemus' \"La Bomba\" womenswear collection. Credit: Jacquemus\n\nThe collection, named Le Gadjo, captures the spirit and diversity of men from the South of France. Jacquemus, born in Provence, returns to the area often, and his Instagram feed is largely a tribute to long days on the beach, his family and the unique color palette of the region.\n\nSandy hues, striking blues, olives and orange shades sampled from coastal sunsets made their way down the runway. Casual tailoring mixed with swimwear and tracksuits; the knitwear was laid-back, the sort of thing you would throw on after showering the sand off on a cooler summer evening.\n\nA model in Jacquemus menswear. Credit: BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe cast of models was diverse and gorgeously youthful. Staying on afterward to hang out, a group of models gathered on the rocks playing music on their iPhones as the sun set. From a distance they looked like local teenagers.\n\nJacquemus doesn't work with casting directors, preferring to find his models in more organic ways, on Instagram or through friends. \"I don't like casting directors,\" he said. \"I like someone or not, you know, and of course the idea was to have a lot of Mediterranean guys, but there were no rules.\"\n\nWomen for his mother, men for his lover\n\nThe designer has often said that the Jacquemus woman was for his mother, who passed away when he was just 18. When asked why he chose to pursue a menswear collection now, his answer was simple. \"I fell in love one year ago, and it gave me the energy to tell a story about a man.\"\n\nAfter the show, guests made their way along a path that led to a small harbor area where drinks were served and a trio of guitarists provided the entertainment. Locals from the nearby houses mixed with fashion editors and friends of Jacquemus. Love was in the air.",

  "text": "Written by Samantha Tse, CNN\n\nSamantha Tse is an experienced fashion writer and editor. Her work has been published in several international publications including T Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, CNN Style, Allure and Disegno.\n\nIt was announced yesterday that American fashion brand Michael Kors had snapped up famed label Versace for $2.1 billion , taking over one of the last independent Italian brands in an effort to build an empire to rival major European conglomerates LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton (whose stable of brands includes Givenchy, Fendi, Dior among many others) and Kering (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and others).\n\nWith Versace and Jimmy Choo (purchased in 2017) under his belt, Kors, who will rename his company Capri Holdings Limited upon completion of the sale, is already wreaking havoc in the existing power structure that has dominated luxury fashion since the 1990s. The question now is whether the American designer and his chief executive and chairman John Idol can succeed where their other countrymen have failed and create America's first luxury group.\n\n\"Whereas the Kors women has a healthy athletic glow and good manners, the Versace muse is a bronzed goddess, swigging champagne until the early hours.\"\n\nVersace executive Jonathan Akeroyd, designer Donatella Versace and Michael Kors CEO John Idol. Credit: Rahi Rezvani\n\n\"Michael Kors is building what is virtually unknown: an American backed luxury parent company. Provided it works, it places him in a league apart from his rivals such as Ralph Lauren,\" fashion historian Bronwyn Cosgrave said in a phone interview. \"He will not only be the figurehead behind his own name brand but could become known for revitalizing a legendary European brand, which no American designer has accomplished.\"\n\nWhat does the acquisition mean for both brands and what will they gain by joining up?\n\nMichael Kors and Versace are two brands who are known for their seduction and glamor, albeit at different ends of the spectrum, but the venture could be highly advantageous to both parties.\n\nLong Island-born Michael Kors launched his brand in 1981 and has built his empire selling aesthetics drawn from the American jet-set lifestyle. His woman is sun-kissed with a neutral lip and a healthy glow. Her hair is always glossed, and she's adorned in gold accessories.\n\nMichael Kors Collection Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: JP Yim/Getty Images North America/Getty Images for Michael Kors\n\nKors has made most of his money in the mid-market, with a large presence in shopping malls. The brand has a strong focus on accessories ranging from bags to shoes and watches, which are coveted both in America and in Europe. And, the American designer is a household name through his fashion label but also because of his 10-year stint as a judge on Project Runway.\n\nVersace, on the other hand, is the epitome of Italian fashion: high-octane glamour and sex appeal at a very high price point. Whereas the Kors women has a healthy athletic glow and good manners, the Versace muse is a bronzed goddess, swigging champagne until the early hours.\n\nVersace is also a household name, but more so for its association with celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, who wore the now infamous green silk dress with a neckline that dipped to her naval, and Elizabeth Hurley, whose Versace safety pin dress catapulted her into stardom.\n\nVersace Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVersace was founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. Until his murder in 1997, he ran the creative side of the business and was credited with creating the supermodel phenomenon of the 1980s and 90s, championing diversity and blending high fashion with pop culture. After his death, his sister Donatella took over the brand. (She will remain as its creative director after the sale.)\n\nWhat's the drama?\n\nIt's no surprise that a sale of this magnitude has raised some eyebrows. Some of the controversy stems from Versace, a brand historically aligned with Italian heritage, culture and craftsmanship, being purchased by an American company that has made its money in malls. But Versace has also suffered because of its lack of accessibility. For many luxury houses, makeup or accessories are the entry point, areas where Versace lags. While it produces handbags and shoes, none of it is particularly coveted or seen as a must-have product.\n\nMichael Kors' chief executive and chairman John Idol wants to remedy this. His strategy for Versace, as outlined in a statement by the brand, includes an increase in accessories and footwear, and the opening of approximately 100 new stores around the world. Idol aims to grow Versace's revenue to $2 billion in the long term.\n\nDonatella Versace: A fashion icon ft. Lady Gaga\n\n\"(Kors) also has immense credibility in this space. While Michael Kors handbags today are as sought after as Prada in Europe, Mr. Kors was also instrumental in revitalizing Celine. His seven-year tenure there transformed it from virtually dormant to relevant,\" said Cosgrave. \"With his own brand, he seems to have made it a success by distilling European fashion trends to the American market. He has a solid track record creating ready-to-wear and perhaps this can lend credibility to Versace,\" Cosgrave said.\n\nMichael Kors isn't the first American to try to create a homegrown version of the conglomerates that dominate European luxury. Several have tried, including Liz Claiborne who purchased American mid-market brands Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand jeans and Kate Spade in 2012. Most recently Tapestry who owns Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, is trying to enter the arena but Kors is planning a group of a different kind: one whose focus is global rather than harvesting only American brands.\n\nWith Jimmy Choo and Versace under his belt, he's got his gloves on and is ready to enter the ring. Kors may be the underdog now but as the American fashion company is slowly wedging its way into an arena heavily dominated by European conglomerates. And by amalgamating luxury European brands into the American fold, he is both giving American luxury a one-up on the global stage, and dissolving fashion borders that have been tied to class and national heritage, and creating a more global approach within the industry.",

  "text": "Written by Rhonda Garelick, CNN\n\nFor more on Justice Ginsburg, watch CNN Films' \"RBG\" on Sunday, September 9 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nSometimes, fashion's greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nGinsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those \"disappeared\" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.\n\nUS Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Credit: Tim Sloan/Getty Images\n\nToday, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.\n\nBeyond a feminizing touch\n\nGiven her historic position and stature -- she's the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.\n\nAssociate Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Credit: Paul J. Richards/Getty Images\n\nIn adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.\n\nBeyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.\n\nThere is her favorite \"majority\" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her \"dissenting\" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in \"Ruth\") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).\n\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's \"majority\" collar. Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWhen espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.\n\nWhen worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.\n\nBut those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not \"wear\" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least\"straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as \"mind\" or \"spirit,\" while women represent the baser realms of \"body\" and \"flesh.\"\n\nRe-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes\n\nTo clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.\n\nThis risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.\n\nGinsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of \"body\" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy , Justice John Paul Stevens, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia , Justice David H. Souter, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Samuel Alito. Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nTo re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most \"noticeable\" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).\n\nGinsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.\n\nAnd finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.\n\nUS President Barack Obama is greeted by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as Obama arrives to deliver his State of the Union address on January 12, 2016. Credit: Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images\n\nThis has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary \"RBG\" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg's judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in \"RBG drag,\" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: \"Imagine yourself here! This could be you!\"\n\nOf course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct when Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar.",

  "text": "Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN\n\nIn a black and white photo from the 1950s, singer and actress Eartha Kitt is seen dressed in head-to-toe leopard print. She looks defiant and self-assured, while, next to her, a cheetah sits nonchalantly on a leash.\n\nIt is an iconic photo. It is also one of the images that, three decades ago, inspired burlesque dancer Jo Weldon to start researching the story and legacy of leopard print. Her findings have been brought together in a new book, \"Fierce: The History of Leopard Print,\" in which Weldon charts the origins, evolution and changing status of one of fashion's most ubiquitous patterns.\n\n\"Kitt was a starting point, as I was deeply fascinated by her as a child,\" Weldon said in a phone interview. \"She looked fabulous in her prints -- a strong figure. But she was also a woman of substance. To me, the spots tied both aspects together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 18 Rosalind Russell wears a silk Galanos gown in a promotional shot for \"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad\" in 1967. Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nLeopard motifs -- and feline imagery in general -- have been used to signify power, independence and confidence for centuries, according to Weldon.\n\n\"Leopards have long been seen as fierce, very resilient animals.\" she said. \"I think people feel a primordial connection with them.\"\n\nHistorically, leopards have played a prominent role in iconographies around the world. The \"Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck,\" a clay figurine dating back to around 6000 B.C., shows a female figure resting her arm on a leopard.\n\nAn Egyptian stele shows Nefertiabet, an ancient Egyptian princess wearing a leopard gown. Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nSeshat, the Egyptian goddess of wisdom, is often pictured wearing a leopard or cheetah hide. And goddess Xi Wangmu, known as the Queen Mother of the West in Chinese mythology, is depicted with the teeth of a tiger and the tail of a leopard.\n\n\"During the 18th and 19th centuries, leopard fur and clothes came to signify wealth and status,\" Weldon said. \"Then you enter the 20th century and the start of mass-produced fabrics and garments. The print entered the mainstream, and began having modern significance.\"\n\nAn evolving trend\n\nLeopard print's reputation has gone through a number of iterations since. It has been deemed low-brow, provocative, tacky and dangerous. It has been worn by starlets and associated with cheap clothing. In pop culture, from movies to music, leopard-clad women have been identified as mean, shallow and loose, which Weldon points out through a series of chapters titled \"The Trophy Wife,\" \"The Bad Mother\" and \"The Femme Fatale.\"\n\nJo Weldon wears a leopard dress for a promotional shoot in 2015. Credit: Bettina May\n\nYet, the motif has also been embraced by the upper echelons of fashion. Christian Dior is credited as the first designer to put leopard print -- rather than fur -- on the runway in 1947. Style icons like Josephine Baker, Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Kennedy and Edie Sedgwick all wore the pattern.\n\nIn recent decades, Beyonc\u00e9 has publicly sported leopard print, as have Anna Wintour and Michelle Obama. And, season after season, fashion magazines hail \"the return of leopard\" on designer catwalks, from Balmain to Armani, Cavalli to Givenchy.\n\nBeyonce, wearing a leopard dress, performs for ABC Good Morning in Times Square, New York in 2006. Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n\"Leopard print has swayed in so many different directions because it's open to interpretations,\" Weldon said. \"It can be seen as a 'neutral,' that looks great next to bolder colors, but it can also perfectly stand out on its own.\"\n\n\"Our appreciation of it also goes back to our relationship with the animal: We admire it and fear it, we find it irresistible yet we know it's dangerous. Felines evoke nocturnal activities and playfulness. All of that goes into the print and, by association, to the woman who wears it.\"\n\nEscorted by President Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy departs for a trip to India and Pakistan wearing an Oleg Cassini leopard skin coat in 1962. Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThese dichotomies may explain leopard print's endurance in the public imagination, as well as its ongoing popularity among diverse segments of consumers. Weldon believes the ever-evolving trend is, today, as relevant as ever.\n\n\"In all its forms -- sophisticated, luxe, rebellious, sexy -- (the) leopard print makes a statement. It can't be ignored, whether you like it or loathe it. That's why it's still so prominent in mainstream culture.\n\n\"At a time when women are being pulled in different directions, and are trying to define and affirm what it means to be a strong woman, the pattern feels relevant. It says 'I want to be seen.'\"\n\n\"Fierce: The History of Leopard Print,\" published by HarperCollins, is available now.",

  "title": "Tyler Mitchell: The story of Beyonce's Vogue cover",
  "url": "https://cnn.com/style/article/vogue-september-cover-tyler-mitchell/index.html",
  "text": "Mikelle Street , CNN Written by\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's fourth cover of American Vogue was one for history. Not because she was the first black woman on the cover (Beverly Johnson, 1974), not because she was the first black woman to cover a September issue (Naomi Campbell, 1989), and not because she had racked up the most Vogue covers as a black woman (Shari Belafonte and Rihanna both have five). Instead, for the first time in history, the cover of American Vogue was shot by a black photographer: Tyler Mitchell.\n\nVogue cover featuring Naomi Campbell (1989)\n\n\"When I first started, 21 years ago, I was told that it was hard for me to get onto covers of magazines because black people did not sell,\" Beyonc\u00e9 wrote in her extended captions that went along with the imagery. \"Clearly that has been proven a myth. Not only is an African American on the cover of the most important month for Vogue, this is the first ever Vogue cover shot by an African American photographer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 6 September's Vogue cover was shot by photographer Tyler Mitchell.\n\nIn 126 years of Vogue, the magazine has had various permutations. It started as a weekly, transitioned to a bi-weekly and then finally in 1973 went monthly. Representatives from Cond\u00e9 Nast point to a 1932 cover by Edward Steichen of a woman in a bathing suit as the start of cover photography from the publication, but 1959 brought the first year of all photographic covers, beginning to usher in an era of Vogue as we know it today.\n\nThese landmark dates bring context to numbers like 126 years and 1,512 issues of Vogue that are bandied about social media \u2014 in fact there have been over 2,800 covers. But even with those clarifications, the lack of black photographers still is a glaring omission.\n\nVogue cover by Edward Steichen (1932)\n\n\"Fashion editors in general tend to have a handful of their favorite, reliable photographers whose work, for whatever reason, seems to move or sell copies,\" Valerie Steele the director and chief curator of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology told CNN in a phone interview this week.\n\n\"And with the cover it's quite a special issue because they want someone who is going to sell copies of a magazine. They are not going to use anyone who is remotely edgy or different, they want someone who is reliable and is going to look similar to other things.\" The commercial viability is increasingly important with the September issue, which has been positioned as the most important issue of the year, as explained in a 2009 documentary. As Steele noted, it is known for having the most advertisements of the year.\n\nThe majority of high fashion's most coveted photography is all shot by a small group of photographers. Since beginning to do photographed covers, Vogue estimates that they've given the honor to about 60 people, many of whom were reused.\n\nVogue cover featuring Cindy Crawford, shot by Richard Avedon (1986)\n\nThe late Richard Avedon shot over 140 covers, beginning sporadically in the 1960 and 70s before leading to an almost exclusive period, shooting all but one cover from June 1980 to October 1988. Other names also reappear: Steven Meisel, Patrick Demarchelier, Irving Penn, and Mario Testino amongst them. These names, in kind, also routinely book some of the biggest high fashion ad campaigns.\n\nVogue cover featuring Nicole Kidman, shot by Irving Penn (2004)\n\n\"I think about how in general most of these photographers are men,\" Antwaun Sargent, an art and culture critic said via phone. \"And how Annie Leibovitz had to be the only one in some ways. This conversation isn't just about race, but it extends to gender and things like age. There's a difference in the ways that men and women shoot the body.\"\n\nIn records reviewed and information provided by Cond\u00e9 Nast, there are only a handful of female photographers in Vogue's cover history. Annie Leibovitz appears as the only woman to have shot a cover of Vogue solo since Karen Radkai and Frances McLaughlin-Gill in 1950s and Toni Frissell, who preceded them both in the 1930s and 40s. Inez van Lamsweerde has also shot three covers with her partner Vinoodh Matadin since 2017.\n\nVogue cover featuring Marion Jones, shot by Annie Leibovitz (2001)\n\nTo arrive at this point, Vogue (and the high fashion industry at large) has ignored generations of photographers, including some of the black photographers who have informed Mitchell's own work.\n\n\"The way that [Tyler] thinks about lighting black skin, his interrogation of blackness in general is something that many generations of photographers have looked at,\" Sargent said, referring to a variety of Mitchell's statements, chief amongst them, one that says he shoots with an \"honest gaze.\"\n\nA costumed showgirl sits on a swing above the audience during a performance at the Latin Quarter nightclub, New York, New York, 1958. Credit: Gordon Parks/The LIFE Picture Collection/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nWhile a few names like Gordon Parks -- Parks was the first black photographer to shoot for Vogue in the 40s -- and Lorna Simpson have shot for Vogue in-book there's plenty more that have not. Photographers like Carrie Mae Weems, Awol Erizku, Mickalene Thomas, Micaiah Carter and Shaniqwa Jarvis, all from a variety of generations, and all black, all with a reputation for shooting commercially, have largely been left out of American Vogue. Jarvis has shot for Supreme, Nike and Adidas \u2014 while those brands are not high fashion, they speak to commercial viability. In fact, this summer discussion arose that a shoot Juergen Teller did for an international issue of Vogue mimicked Thomas's trademark aesthetic. Why was Thomas not just hired?\n\nA young highschool student photographed by Gordon Parks Credit: Gordon Parks\n\nOn Instagram, Naomi Campbell spoke to the scarcity of black photographers in high fashion. When stylist Ugo Mozie posted , criticizing Vogue for taking so long to cast a black photographer for the cover, the iconic supermodel commented \"You're correct, it's a disgrace!! In my 32 years, I only got to work with one fashion photographer, this is why I will continue to push for diversity in my industry.\" While her agents declined to specify whether Campbell was saying she had only worked with one black fashion photographer at Vogue --she's had seven covers --or in the industry overall, with a career as prolific as hers, the stat is damning. While her agents declined to specify whether Campbell was saying she had only worked with one black fashion photographer at Vogue -- she's had seven covers -- or in the industry overall, with a career as prolific as hers, the stat is damning.\n\nBut why is this change coming now?\n\nBefore the cover was revealed Huffington Post ran a report that Vogue had ceded control of the cover to Beyonc\u00e9. According to the publication, Beyonc\u00e9 had brought Mitchell to Vogue and as such single handedly initiated this change in history.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 by photographer Tyler Mitchell for Vogue Credit: Tyler Mitchell\n\n\"Until there is a mosaic of perspectives coming from different ethnicities behind the lense, we will continue to have a narrow approach and view of what the world actually looks like. That is why I wanted to work with this brilliant 23-year-old photographer Tyler Mitchell,\" she wrote in her cover story. \"If people in powerful positions continue to hire and cast only people who look like them, sound like them, come from the same neighborhoods they grew up in, they will never have a greater understanding of experiences different from their own. They will hire the same models, curate the same art, cast the same actors over and over again, and we will all lose.\"\n\nVogue's recounting paints a different tale. They suggested Mitchell's name to Beyonc\u00e9 amongst a list of other photographers, and understanding the historical significance, Beyonc\u00e9 selected the young creative. Mitchell has even supported this version on his Twitter account, in a now deleted tweet. Regardless of which actually happened, the new move extends fashion's long running conversation about representation, finally behind the lens.\n\nFor decades, Vogue had no real reason to venture out of the creatives they had been using. Stylists and editors continued to use their go-to photographers. But in the past few years with America's disinterest with print magazines , a slate of sexual assault accusations that caused Cond\u00e9 Nast to distance itself from various photographers and changing conversations in fashion about identity, changes were iminent.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 by photographer Tyler Mitchell for Vogue Credit: Tyler Mitchell\n\n\"[My black photography students] have all been saying, we don't really see ourselves out there, in the industry, in photography.\" Kimberly Jenkins, a lecturer at Parsons said via phone. \"One of them in particular was saying she wanted to be a photographer because it wasn't only that she didn't see black photographers in fashion but she didn't see any black women photographers.\"\n\nThat mentality is the latest maturation of a conversation that's been occuring in fashion for over a decade, arguably starting with a call for more diverse castings of models on runways and in ad campaigns. Those calls were soon met with calls for more black designers and stylists and even the hair and makeup teams. But the role of photographer rarely crept into the dialogue.\n\n\"It's such a powerful position; you know we're definitely doing the styling now, and we're definitely doing the hair and makeup but to let a person of color, especially a black person, take control of the lens and control the gaze for a major publication? That's a huge responsibility,\" Jenkins said. \"You're guiding [the public] in how we're going to look at something.\"\n\nAnd now, even that shall be through a \"mosaic of perspectives.\"",

  "text": "Damaged hospitals and \u2018catastrophic damage\u2019 on the Gulf\n\nA storm that was initially forecast to arrive as a tropical storm instead amped up to furious intensity, hitting landfall just after midday Wednesday near the small seaside community of Mexico Beach, 100 miles southwest of Tallahassee, with winds topping 155 miles per hour.\n\nImages from there showed swaths of shattered debris where houses once stood and structures inundated up to their rooftops; the streets of Panama City, farther west, were blocked by downed tree limbs and impossible tangles of power lines. Recreational vehicles, trucks and even trains were pushed over, surrounded by new lakes of water.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and other casualties was uncertain: Governor Scott told CNN on Thursday that two hospitals in Panama City were damaged in the storm and were \u201cin the process of being closed down.\u201d\n\nHe said that temporary hospitals were being set up to treat people injured in the storm, but that \u201cwe don\u2019t know the numbers\u201d of injured yet.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern would be loss of life,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida said he had heard from local authorities who described extensive damage. \u201cThese are not people prone to hyperbole,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on CNN. \u201cPanama City is catastrophic damage. Someone told me, \u2018Mexico Beach is gone.\u2019\u201d\n\nResidents and emergency workers spent most of Wednesday hunkered down, and emerged only toward nightfall to begin assessing the storm\u2019s toll. As dusk approached, though, the early outlines of a vast calamity were unfolding.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t drive a car anywhere, you can\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s littered with houses, pieces of houses,\u201d said Patricia Mulligan, who rode out the storm with her family in a condo in Mexico Beach, a town of mom-and-pop shops and sport-fishing businesses about 35 miles southeast of Panama City. Outside, she said in a phone interview, she could see remnants of people\u2019s lives strewn about: refrigerators, a beanbag chair, a washing machine, a kayak and a dresser.",

  "text": "I didn\u2019t go to Kensington at night on Code Blue days in December, when the temperatures were dangerously cold. But the addicts were still there. They set up burn barrels to keep fires going, and the city opened emergency warming rooms. Even when the temperatures dropped to single digits, many of the addicts refused go to a shelter. For some users, opioid withdrawal was worse than the possibility of freezing to death.\n\nThis January, Gov. Tom Wolf signed a statewide disaster declaration, the first of its kind for a public-health emergency in Pennsylvania. There had been more than 1,200 overdose deaths in Philadelphia in 2017 \u2014 a 34 percent rise from 2016. Wolf pushed the state to roll back regulations that might be stopping users from getting help, like ID and sobriety requirements for shelters and treatment facilities. Instead of sending overdosed people back out onto the street, the city hired recovery specialists in the E.R. to talk to them about treatment. It handed out tens of thousands of doses of Narcan. It sent a van into the neighborhood to offer recovery services. It gave residents blue light bulbs for their porches, because the light seemed to make it harder for heroin users to find a vein.\n\nShanta Schachter, a community development consultant who was hired by Conrail during the cleanup as a liaison between the company and neighborhood organizations, watched the new encampments grow throughout the winter. Months before the Conrail cleanup began, she attended community meetings and chatted with neighbors. She had encouraged residents to take control of Kensington by planting trees in vacant lots, building fences, painting abandoned buildings, installing streetlights. During the cleanup, she was hopeful, but after she drove through the tunnels, she was worried about the addicts living there. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an incredible amount of suffering,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people are getting better. There aren\u2019t resources to help the people who are addicted now. I don\u2019t think anybody really knows how to get the addicts off the streets. It can\u2019t just be new beds, or recovery services, or anything else. It has to be everything.\u201d\n\nThe city was willing to try almost anything. In January, the Department of Public Health announced that the city would \u201cencourage organizations to develop\u201d supervised-injection sites, where people can bring their own drugs without fear of arrest and inject under the care of a medical team. There are roughly 120 of these injection sites around the world \u2014 although none in the United States \u2014 and research has shown that they reduce overdose deaths, connect addicts to long-term care and help keep neighborhoods clean of needles. There has never been a fatal overdose at an official safe-injection site. The Justice Department made it clear that it would view any such place to be in violation of federal drug laws, but Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and Philadelphia mayor, threw his support behind a nonprofit group trying to establish one.\n\nAt one community meeting this March, city officials explained the idea to residents. The clinic would be located where the most overdose deaths occurred, and that very likely meant Kensington. Many of the overdose victims were white men, though, and some of the minority residents didn\u2019t think it was fair. They worried that establishing a supervised-injection site in the neighborhood would condemn it to a permanent future of drug use. Brooke Feldman, a social worker, had planned to bring a homeless user named Johnny to the meeting, but when she went to the Tulip Street underpass that morning, he had already died of an overdose. \u201cHe said he would use the site and wanted to be a part of the conversation,\u201d Feldman told me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even live to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nDan Martino, a community organizer who put together a march for overdose awareness, had been lobbying for a supervised-injection site for years. \u201cWe already have unsafe injection sites on every street corner in the city, and it\u2019s not working out,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to be easier to get help than heroin.\u201d\n\nIn February, on a concrete stoop on East Tusculum Street near the Kensington Avenue tunnel, two sisters, Nancy and Dawn, watched the addicts. Dawn wore a green T-shirt that read, \u201cDawn\u2019s drinking club,\u201d and her blond hair was high in a ponytail. \u201cAlmost everybody I grew up with is either an addict or dead,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like the only one.\u201d",

  "title": "Opinion | A Lesson for Kavanaugh From Another Tarnished Supreme Court Justice",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/opinion/editorials/kavanaugh-thomas-nomination-lesson.html",
  "text": "Shortly after the president announced the nomination, rumors circulated that as a young lawyer in Alabama, Black had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The N.A.A.C.P. asked for an investigation, but a Senate Judiciary subcommittee rammed the nomination through to the full committee after two hours of consideration. One Democratic senator, William Dieterich of Illinois, accused other senators of trying to \u201cbesmirch\u201d Black\u2019s reputation. As the historian William E. Leuchtenberg described the scene in a fascinating 1973 article, \u201cDieterich\u2019s tirade nearly resulted in a fist fight\u201d as another Democratic senator charged at him.\n\nSupreme Court nominees did not ordinarily appear at their confirmation hearings in those days, but Black\u2019s supporters said he had assured them that he had never joined the Klan. The full committee moved the nomination to the Senate floor. Black was confirmed by a vote of 63 to 16, and the new justice and his wife set sail for a European vacation.\n\nIn mid-September, while Black was in Paris and the court was getting ready to open a new term, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published the first of six articles conclusively linking him to the Klan. Soon, the country was in an uproar. The Klan stood for violence not only against African-Americans but also against Catholics, who were prominent among Roosevelt\u2019s most loyal supporters. Catholic members of Congress demanded that Black step down. Senator David I. Walsh, a Democrat and a former governor of Massachusetts, charged that \u201cBlack obtained his nomination and confirmation by concealment and thereby deceived the president and his fellow senators, especially the latter.\u201d A Gallup poll found that 59 percent of the public believed Black should resign if the charge was true.\n\nOn his return to the United States, Black gave a national radio address, as unusual then as Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appearance on Fox News was this month. Carried by 300 stations on three radio networks, the speech attracted the second-biggest audience of the decade, outdone only by the abdication speech of King Edward VIII. Black conceded that he had joined the Klan and said he had resigned before he became a senator. He neither explained his decisions nor apologized for his membership. In fact, in Professor Leuchtenberg\u2019s account, \u201cHe spent the first third of his remarks cautioning against the possibility of a revival of racial and religious hatred, but he warned that this might be brought about not by groups like the Klan but by those who questioned his right to be on the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe national press excoriated the speech as thoroughly inadequate, but Roosevelt discerned accurately that \u201cit did the trick,\u201d as he told his confidant James Farley. A new Gallup Poll showed that a majority of Americans now believed that Black should not resign. He was on the bench when the new term opened three days after his speech, went on to serve for 34 years, one of the longest Supreme Court tenures, before retiring in 1971 at the age of 85.",

  "text": "Meet the Hosts\n\nRoss Douthat\n\nImage\n\nI\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.\n\nMichelle Goldberg\n\nImage\n\nI\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.\n\nDavid Leonhardt\n\nImage\n\nI\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.",

  "text": "With less than a month until Election Day, it\u2019s time for Democrats to hunker down and get serious about their midterm messaging. In the dispiriting aftermath of the recent Supreme Court confirmation circus, this means taking a couple of deep breaths, not flipping out over the Republicans\u2019 purported \u201cKavanaugh bounce\u201d (which might be more of a hiccup) and focusing on a few key issues that resonate with a broad swath of voters.\n\nRepublicans are twitchy about their electoral prospects. They know that midterm elections tend to go poorly for the party that holds the White House, just as they are aware that President Trump, while beloved by the base, has a popularity problem among the wider electorate. Party leaders are going all in with the culture-warring and scaremongering, looking to drive their voters to the polls with the specter of a wild-eyed, rage-filled Democratic \u201cmob\u201d hellbent on destroying the Republic. In a Wednesday op-ed in USA Today, the president himself indulged in some light red-baiting, claiming that \u201cradical socialist\u201d Democrats want to turn America into Venezuela. The entire screed was classic Trump: unhinged, breathtakingly dishonest and aimed squarely at making the opposition\u2019s head explode.\n\nAs part of this base-stroking, Republicans are eager to keep the debate raging over their freshly confirmed, ultra-polarizing Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh. The brutal fight to seat Justice Kavanaugh, which morphed from an inquiry into the judicial fitness of one man into a culture-war cage match over women\u2019s rights and shifting sexual mores, electrified many left-leaning voters. But it also stirred up die-hard Republicans, potentially endangering the \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d Democrats had been enjoying.\n\nWith Justice Kavanaugh now safely tucked into his lifetime appointment, there\u2019s much less cause for conservatives to stay angry. And even if they\u2019re stewing today, or next weekend, three-plus weeks is an eternity in politics \u2014 all the more in a political climate dominated by this endlessly dramatic White House. Thus, we see prominent Republicans, including the Senate majority leader and the head of the Republican National Committee, peddling the idea that if Democrats gain power in Congress, one of their top priorities will be to impeach Justice Kavanaugh. No matter that this claim has no factual basis \u2014 it plays perfectly to the Republican base\u2019s enduring sense of victimhood.",

  "text": "O.K., he\u2019s probably right. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t deserve a little political diversion.\n\nFor instance, you\u2019ve probably heard about Representative Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, who is a heavy favorite for re-election even though he\u2019s been the subject of an attack ad made by six of his siblings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intervention time, and intervention time means \u2026 you go to vote Paul out,\u201d says one brother in the ad for Gosar\u2019s opponent, which is titled \u201cA Family Defends Its Honor.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you this has really made a difference; the polls suggest Gosar is still going to win. However, it could be a useful citation during your next family argument. (\u201cWell, at least I never made an attack ad against you!\u201d)\n\nI am sorry to report that Florida Republicans have let us down and nominated a Spanish-language TV star, Maria Elvira Salazar, for Congress in a district where one of the other candidates was a businesswoman whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included having been kidnapped by space aliens.\n\nBettina Rodriguez Aguilera did actually have a lot of assets, including a career as a local councilwoman and a strong record of helping other women run for office.

But nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\nAnd this week we had the Taylor Swift story! Even people who do not know the name of their current member of Congress know that Swift has endorsed former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen for the Senate. After a career in which she\u2019s avoided saying anything much about politics, Swift popped up with the announcement that she\u2019s voting for Bredesen because his Republican opponent, Representative Marsha Blackburn, has a voting record that \u201cappalls and terrifies me.\u201d",

  "title": "Opinion | Heat and Humidity Are a Killer Combination",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/11/opinion/heat-humidity-killer-combination.html",
  "text": "Climate science tells us that in the future, combinations of heat and humidity could be so extreme that the evaporation of human sweat may not sufficiently cool our bodies. Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nAfter enduring another scorching summer \u2014 the fourth-hottest on record for the contiguous United States \u2014 it may be hard to imagine conditions getting much worse. But as a new report from the United Nations\u2019 panel on climate change warns, we are locked in to additional warming and other changes like sea level rise. And we are running out of time to avert potentially catastrophic outcomes.\n\nOne critically important and underreported fact is that as temperatures rise, absolute humidity, the total amount of moisture in the air, will also increase. That may create combinations of heat and humidity so extreme that the evaporation of human sweat won\u2019t sufficiently cool our bodies, leaving even healthy adults at risk of death from overheating.\n\nOur research suggests that in about 50 years, these deadly conditions \u2014 almost unknown on the planet today \u2014 could occur once per decade in parts of the world. Millions of people could be exposed to these extreme conditions if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise following historical trends.\n\nToday\u2019s Extreme Events, and a Harsh Future\n\nThe heat index, also known as the \u201cfeels-like\u201d temperature, shows how hot it feels when you consider the combined effect of temperature and humidity.\n\n\n\nThe highest heat index measured at Central Park in New York this summer was 106 degrees on July 3, when the temperature reached 92 degrees and the relative humidity was a muggy 62 percent. That's in the National Weather Service's \u201cdanger\u201d zone for heat exhaustion, which can be deadly, especially for the elderly and the sick. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include muscle cramps, dizziness and vomiting. Heat indexes above about 137 degrees make any strenuous outdoor activity critically dangerous and potentially fatal, even for healthy people. These conditions are rare but not unheard of.\n\n\n\nDuring the 1995 Midwest heat wave, for example, parts of Wisconsin experienced heat indexes above 137 degrees. More than 700 people died in Chicago, where the heat index was lower, topping out at 125 degrees. There is a far deadlier threshold.\n\n\n\nIn theory, a healthy adult resting in the shade, wearing thin clothing and with an endless supply of water could survive temperatures in excess of anything experienced on earth \u2014 if the air is dry. Add sufficient humidity, and even at far lower temperatures the same person would overheat and could die in a matter of hours. Sweat takes away excess heat as it evaporates. When the heat index tops about 165 degrees, the evaporation of sweat will not cool us sufficiently. Core body temperature will rise, and if it exceeds its tolerable range, organs will strain and start to fail. On July 31, 2015 in Bandar Mahshahr, Iran, the heat index reached 165 degrees, among the highest ever recorded. Thanks to robust infrastructure and cheap electricity, the city\u2019s residents were able to take refuge in air-conditioned buildings, middle-class luxuries that don't exist for many in the hottest regions.\n\nAccording to our projections, about 11 million people \u2014 nearly the population of Ohio \u2014 could be at risk of suffering heat and humidity past this limit of human tolerance at least once by 2080. And a heat index of about 165 degrees is deadly for even healthy adults resting in the shade. For children, the elderly, the sick and the billions who work outside, heat indexes of 115 to 130 degrees have led to tens of thousands of deaths in recent heat waves.\n\nA man suffering from heat exhaustion is showered at a medical camp in Karachi, Pakistan, where a heat wave killed dozens of people in May 2018. Rehan Khan/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nSuffering Ahead for Billions of People\n\nWarnings about extreme heat sometimes refer only to air temperature, and climate assessments rarely consider humidity. But for most hot and humid places, the number of days with an extreme combination of heat and humidity is projected to increase much faster than the number of days with just extreme air temperatures.\n\nBy 2080, more than three billion people could experience a heat index above about 122 degrees \u2014 considered extremely dangerous by the National Weather Service \u2014 and almost one billion could suffer conditions that make prolonged exposure or strenuous outdoor activity critically dangerous.\n\nPopulation exposed to extreme heat and humidity 3.1 billion people in 2080 30 percent of the world\u2019s population 20 EXTREME Danger of heat exhaustion 1.0 10 billion Outdoor Activity CRITICALLY DANGEROUS 0 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 3.1 Population exposed to extreme heat and humidity billion people in 2080 percent of the world\u2019s population 30 20 EXTREME Danger of heat exhaustion 1.0 10 billion Outdoor Activity CRITICALLY DANGEROUS 0 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 Populations refer to those predicted to be exposed to the specified level of heat and humidity at least once.\n\nTwo generations from now, heat indexes higher than about 137 degrees, above which strenuous outside activity is critically dangerous, could occur regularly in the eastern United States. There are several reasons for this region\u2019s projected susceptibility, including low elevation and abundant moisture from the balmy Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. Globally, in the tropics and subtropics \u2014 including India, eastern China, parts of Brazil, central Africa and many other densely populated regions \u2014 seven or more days per year could be spent above this threshold.\n\nBy 2080: Days with heat indexes above 137 degrees 0 1 every 2 years 1 a year 2 A YEAR 3 A YEAR 7 A YEAR Atlanta Shanghai New Delhi Dubai Hong Kong Khartoum, Sudan Manaus, Brazil Lagos, Nigeria By 2080: Days with heat indexes above 137 degrees 0 1 every 2 years 1 a year 2 A YEAR 3 A YEAR 7 A YEAR Atlanta Shanghai New Delhi Dubai Hong Kong Khartoum, Sudan Manaus, Brazil Lagos, Nigeria By 2080: Days with heat indexes above 137 degrees 0 1 every 2 years 1 a year 2 A YEAR 3 A YEAR 7 A YEAR Atlanta Shanghai Dubai Manaus, Brazil Lagos, Nigeria Gray regions had zero predicted occurrences of a heat index above 137 degrees or the occurrences were too rare to estimate.\n\nSoaring Frequency of Humid Heat Around the World\n\nWhat is currently considered severe humid heat will become frequent. Imagine the single highest heat index that your region experiences each year. We studied how often those conditions could occur by 2080.\n\nProjections for the United States are sobering. By 2080, New York City could experience approximately six weeks per year of humid heat at least as extreme as what has been experienced only once a year, on average, between 1981 and 2005.\n\nBy 2080: How many weeks per year the city could experience that heat index The worst heat index each year, on average 90\u00b0 3 weeks Seattle 109\u00b0 4 weeks Chicago 105\u00b0 6 weeks New York City 103\u00b0 8 weeks Atlanta By 2080: How many weeks per year the city could see that heat index The worst heat index each year, on average 90\u00b0 3 weeks Seattle 109\u00b0 4 weeks Chicago New York City 105\u00b0 6 weeks 103\u00b0 8 weeks Atlanta\n\nParts of the southeastern United States could see more than three months per year with heat indexes higher than the current once-per-year extreme.\n\nBy 2080: Months per year with heat indexes higher than the current once-per-year extreme 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 Wash. Maine Mont. N.D. Ore. Vt. Minn. N.H. Idaho Mass. S.D. Wis. N.Y. R.I. Conn. Mich. Wyo. Iowa N.J. Penn. Nev. Neb. Ohio Md. Del. Utah Ill. Ind. Colo. W. Va. Va. Mo. Calif. Kan. Ky. N.C. Tenn. Ariz.

Hawaii By 2080: Months per year with heat indexes higher than the current once-per-year extreme 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\nThe picture looks even more bleak in the tropics, a region that has contributed relatively little to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the tropics could spend more than half the year under conditions worse than the current once-per-year extreme.\n\nBy 2080: Months per year with heat indexes higher than the current once-per-year extreme 1 2 3 6 Moscow London Rome Istanbul New York Beijing Tokyo Los Angeles Cairo Shanghai Riyadh, Saudia Arabia Kolkata, India Hong Kong Mexico City Mumbai Lagos, Nigeria Bogota, Colombia Nairobi, Kenya Singapore Jakarta, Indonesia Rio de Janeiro Santiago, Chile Sydney Cape Town By 2080: Months per year with heat indexes higher than the current once-per-year extreme 1 2 3 6 Istanbul New York Hong Kong Cairo Mumbai Lagos, Nigeria Bogota, Colombia Jakarta, Indonesia Rio de Janeiro By 2080: Months per year with heat indexes higher than the current once-per-year extreme 1 2 3 6 Moscow London Istanbul New York Beijing Tokyo Los Angeles Cairo Hong Kong Mumbai Mexico City Lagos, Nigeria Bogota, Colombia Nairobi, Kenya Singapore Jakarta, Indonesia Rio de Janeiro Sydney Cape Town Santiago, Chile\n\nAvoiding the Worst, Adapting to the Inevitable\n\nThe most direct way to minimize the effects of worsening heat and humidity is to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 for example, by taxing carbon and investing far more boldly in renewable energy.\n\nBut because some impacts of climate change are unavoidable, we\u2019ll also need to adapt. Shifting daily activities \u2014 everything from outdoor markets to children\u2019s sports \u2014 to the nighttime could reduce the impact of hotter, more humid days. Automation could play a larger role in daytime work for industries like construction and agriculture. But these and other adaptations will entail significant societal and economic costs.\n\nAir-conditioning, which is either unavailable or too expensive for many, will increasingly become a life-or-death requirement in parts of the world. But more air-conditioning would lead to more climate warming, especially if powered by fossil fuels.\n\nHomeless boys and a stray dog sleep in the breeze of an exhaust fan outside a restaurant in New Delhi. Tsering Topgyal/Associated Press\n\nMore research is also needed on just how harmful these unprecedented levels of heat and humidity will be for human health, especially among the most vulnerable: the elderly, those with pre-existing health conditions and people without air-conditioning. What are the economic and social costs of lost productivity, everywhere from agricultural fields to classrooms? Questions about how wildlife and natural ecosystems will be affected by humid heat are also mostly unexplored.\n\nIt remains to be seen to what extent society can adapt to frequent, unprecedented heat stress. But the prospects could dim as more locations reach deadly levels of heat and humidity, potentially unleashing cascading impacts like food insecurity, forced migration and violent conflict. In the immediate future, however, we need to consider how climate variables like heat and humidity could dance together to create outcomes that might be more extreme than imagined \u2014 and more dangerous.\n\nThe authors are climate scientists Ethan Coffel at Dartmouth College, Radley Horton at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and Colin Raymond at Columbia University.",

  "text": "This may be surprising, because the income tax purports to be imposed on \u201call income from whatever source derived\u201d \u2014 and the I.R.S. is clear that this should be interpreted broadly to include not just a person\u2019s salary, but also unemployment benefits, lottery winnings and even the cash value of bartered items.\n\nNonetheless, the income tax code has an explicit exclusion for funds received by gift and inheritance. The reason for this exclusion is not clear. Gifts and inheritances were originally subject to tax in the first income tax code and were removed in 1913. One tax scholar suggests \u201c the tale is simply one of the triumph of lobbyists .\u201d As a result, a person can inherit $ 100 million, or even $100 billion, and owe no income taxes .\n\nThere is not even a requirement to report that money on a tax return. This allows the wealthy to believe that their tax liability is more burdensome than it actually is. Imagine a person with a $1 million salary (subject to $350,000 in income taxes) and a $100 million inheritance. Since he has to report only that $1 million, he might think he is paying taxes at a rate of 35 percent, when his actual tax burden is less than 1 percent of the wealth he acquired that year.\n\nThe second way that the ultrarich make their wealth is through building or investing in businesses. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the ultimate example of the successful entrepreneur. With wealth topping $160 billion, Mr. Bezos is not only the wealthiest American, but is also estimated to be the richest person in the world.\n\nThis enormous wealth has not resulted in much in the form of income taxes . Unlike many European countries, the United States does not tax the value of a person\u2019s property; income taxes are due only if Mr. Bezos sells his stock. Mr. Bezos need not sell his stock in order to enjoy its value, because the tax rules allow him to borrow against the stock tax-free. Most troubling, Mr. Bezos and his family can avoid all income taxes on the growth in the value of his stock by holding it until his death. His heirs will then be treated as if they had purchased the stock at its market price, allowing them to sell it without owing any income tax.",

  "text": "It is at this level of legislative races \u2014 low visibility elections that carry exceptionally high stakes \u2014 that Democrats face intimidating Republican majorities. For Democrats to see across-the-board gains on the scale that Republicans achieved in 2010 would require not just a wave, but a tidal wave.\n\nIt is difficult to overestimate the political importance of the Midwest. The region was not only crucial to Trump\u2019s victory, it has been crucial to continuing conservative control of both branches of Congress.\n\nMatt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State, put it this way on Twitter:\n\nSome interpreted 2016 as beginning of possible realignment of the Great Lakes Midwest, with the white working class leaving Democrats. But this year, Senate races in those states are not even competitive for Republicans.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nate Silver, the founder of the political website 538, tweeted:\n\nBy far the Democrats\u2019 strongest region in Senate + Gov + House polling has been the Midwest, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d really gather that from the tonality of the reporting, which tends to fixate on demographic change and therefore finds races in the South & the West a lot sexier.\n\nAccording to both Democratic and Republican operatives, Republican difficulties in the region stem in part from the trend among many Obama 2012-to-Trump-2016 voters to switch back to the Democrats.\n\nNick Gourevitch, whose Democratic firm, Global Strategy Group, is polling in the Midwest, wrote in an email: \u201cIn general, we are seeing Obama-Trump districts returning to the fold as competitive seats.\u201d He went on:\n\nOur postelection research on Obama-Trump voters showed that many of them were conflicted voters who had mixed feelings about supporting the president and that not all of them were the die-hard Trump supporters some in the media like to report them to be.\n\nGourevitch\u2019s assessment is shared by a Republican consultant active in the region who requested anonymity to avoid alienating clients.\n\nHis studies, and polling by others in the region, he wrote me by email, show\n\nthat a significant portion of the Trump vote was comprised of nose-holders \u2014 that is, voters who weren\u2019t particularly fond of Trump, but liked Hillary a helluva lot less, so they voted for Trump.\n\n\u201cThese voters have not transitioned into strong Trump supporters, but rather Trump doubters,\u201d the Republican consultant continued.\n\nThey may like the policies he\u2019s espousing, but are turned off by his style of leadership. To say they are returning to the Democratic fold would be an overstatement because all the Democrats stand for is their opposition to Trump nowadays.

The \u201cTrump doubters,\u201d he argues,\n\nare open for either side in \u201920. They are certainly still open for Trump, depending on who the Democrats put up.

In the Midwest and nationally, Republicans and especially Trump are ahead on economy and trade. That\u200e could have real impact in 2020.\u201d More immediately, Lake cautioned, \u201cWe do need to watch men who seem to be moving toward Trump in this last week\u201d \u2014 referring to the aftermath of the bitter fight over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.",

  "text": "Ms. Swift, on the other hand, never, ever spoke about her politics. In 2008, an election year, she said she supported women in office but wouldn\u2019t specify which ones: \u201cI\u2019m an 18-year-old girl, I\u2019m not going to sit here and go into my political views, because that\u2019s not what I chose to do, I chose to do music.\u201d She maintained that evasiveness in 2012 when she told Time magazine: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about politics because it might influence other people. And I don\u2019t think that I know enough yet in life to be telling people who to vote for.\u201d\n\nIf ever there was a time for Ms. Swift to break her silence it was 2016. But when members of the alt-right dubbed Swift their \u201cAryan goddess,\u201d she didn\u2019t say zilch. It\u2019s true that she never said anything to suggest that she agreed with these people. But the fact that she didn\u2019t feel strongly enough to speak up against people widely using her music and image to promote their racist and xenophobic agenda was troubling.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would ever side with Ms. Swift. Then came 2018.\n\nOn Sunday, days after her tour ended, Ms. Swift endorsed two Tennessee Democrats for office, denounced Marsha Blackburn, a Republican Senate candidate in the state who is backed by President Trump, and encouraged people to register to vote. Less than 24 hours later, more than 160,000 people had done so. Call it the Swift bump. It\u2019s two years too late for 2016, but right on time for the midterms.\n\nMeantime, over the past few months, Mr. West has made the red MAGA cap a staple in his wardrobe; he has said that slavery was a choice and suggested we ax the 13th amendment; he has called Mr. Trump \u2014 who has a long history of racist views and supports policies such as \u201cstop and frisk\u201d that hurt black people \u2014 a \u201cbrother.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Trump and Kanye are scheduled to meet at the White House. The two previously met at Trump Tower in 2016.",

  "text": "Prof. Michael E. Mann of Penn State told me that Hurricane Michael should be a wake-up call. \u201cAs should have Katrina, Irene, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, Florence,\u201d he added wryly. \u201cIn each of these storms we can see the impact of climate change: Warmer seas means more energy to intensify these storms, more wind damage, bigger storm surge and more coastal flooding.\u201d\n\nAs recently as the early 2000s, there wasn\u2019t much difference between the parties on climate policy, and Senator John McCain campaigned in 2008 as a leader in reducing carbon emissions. In 2009, Donald Trump joined other business executives in backing more action to address climate change.\n\nYet in the following years Al Gore helped make climate change a Democratic issue, and the Koch brothers helped make climate denial a litmus test of Republican authenticity. Tribalism took over, and climate skepticism became part of the Republican creed. So polls show that today climate denial is far greater in the United States, home to the greatest scientific research in the world, than in just about any other major country.\n\nTrump says he will pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, and he had nothing substantive to say about a new United Nations report, which has been called a \u201cdeafening, piercing smoke alarm\u201d of catastrophic consequences ahead from climate change.\n\nRepublicans are correct that all this is uncertain. But in every other context, we try to prevent threats that are uncertain, and it\u2019s irrational for Trump to be obsessed with, say, Iran, when he seems indifferent to the prospect that we are collectively cooking our entire planet.\n\nThere are legitimate debates about the best way to reduce carbon emissions, and there is reason for skepticism that we will succeed. Carbon taxes would have to be very substantial to have a large impact, geoengineering is uncertain, and there will be painful trade-offs ahead.",

  "text": "I have accepted my reality. I have accepted that today, in this world, if I want birth control without suicide, I will be in pain, inconvenienced, incapacitated for days each month. I have accepted my choice.\n\nBut my experience has shown me that doctors haven\u2019t.\n\nI ask psychiatrists to address the physical side effects of this form of birth control I am stuck with. They ignore my plea for help, repeating what they have said so many times before: \u201cYou can\u2019t take hormonal birth control \u2014 it\u2019ll completely cancel out the benefits of your bipolar meds. And hormones deregulate your mood. You would be putting your mental health at serious risk.\u201d They are unanimous. Hopeless in their soothingly lit offices on their upholstered couches, I nod. \u201cI know,\u201d I say. I know all of this.\n\nMedical doctors outside of mental health care ignore the psychiatric arguments. They assign more importance to physical health than to mental health. Again and again they repeat, \u201cJust take out the IUD. How can it be worth these side effects?\u201d Go without birth control; use condoms or Plan B. I stare at their skeletal system posters and brochures offering treatment for eating disorders and repeat, again and again, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get pregnant \u2014 or even worry about getting pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust try it,\u201d they counter. \u201cTry hormonal birth control.\u201d But \u201cjust trying it\u201d means sinking into depression so severe I can\u2019t get out of bed, brush my teeth, live my life.\n\nNo doctor, not one, has provided viable options to cope with the physical side effects of my birth control. They have repeatedly refused to offer me prescription-strength anti-inflammatories or pain treatment. Neither side is concerned with symptom reduction, with soothing me. They want me to do what they say, without addressing my concerns.\n\nIt\u2019s been proven that doctors \u2014 that people, in general \u2014 minimize women\u2019s pain. We are not believed about our own bodies. But how do you reckon with the added layer of complexity when a woman is in severe physical pain, but also wrestling a mental illness? People with mental illness struggle to be heard, to be taken seriously \u2014 what happens when these realities intersect? And if nothing I say matters in the doctor\u2019s office, why bother talking at all?\n\nI am not sure why doctors refuse to believe my symptoms are really that bad. Are they simply tunnel-visioned, unable to visualize the whole picture? But whatever the cause, the result is the same. They ignore the core of my struggle \u2014 my need to balance side effects. They ignore what I tell them. They ignore me.",

  "title": "A New Biography Presents Gandhi, Warts and All",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/books/review/ramachandra-guha-gandhi.html",
  "text": "The second section that will provoke controversy tackles an even more sensitive subject: Gandhi\u2019s notorious brahmacharya experiments, beginning in 1946. When Gandhi was involved with Sarala, he was 50 and she was 47, a mature woman exercising her own free will. Nearly three decades later, when he was 77, he made the decision to \u201ctest\u201d his vow of chastity by sleeping in a bed with his teenage grandniece, Manu Gandhi.\n\nManu was vulnerable. She had lost her mother at a young age and had been taken in by Gandhi and his wife (who was deceased by the time the \u201cexperiments\u201d started). Manu grew up in an ashram in which everyone was devoted to her great-uncle. She wrote a diary mentioning the \u201cexperiments\u201d that Guha quotes, though it is a compromised source: Gandhi read it as Manu wrote it and his own writing appears in the margins.\n\nGuha has found a letter written by Horace Alexander, a close friend of Gandhi\u2019s. Alexander said that Gandhi told him Manu wanted to test her own vow of chastity. Guha suggests that this puts a new light on the \u201cexperiments,\u201d and that Manu may have become involved partly to deter another man who was pursuing her romantically: \u201cThere may have been, as it were, two sides to the story. Both Gandhi and Manu may have wanted to go through this experiment, or ordeal. To be sure, there was a certain amount of imposition \u2014 from his side.\u201d\n\nThat caveat is important, for, as Guha allows, there was an enormous power differential between Gandhi and Manu. It is not clear that the letter from Alexander changes how we view the \u201cexperiments\u201d: He spoke only to Gandhi, not Manu. In the wake of #MeToo, we know that the powerful may delude themselves about the willingness of those they manipulate, and that their less powerful victims may go along with things they do not want because they are overwhelmed by the status of their abuser.\n\nLest anyone think this applies modern standards to a historical event, Guha provides extensive evidence of the horrified reaction of many of Gandhi\u2019s friends and followers at the time. Most were appalled that a young woman should be used as an instrument in an \u201cexperiment,\u201d and some of his political allies, like Vallabhbhai Patel, feared it would become a scandal. At least one, the stenographer R. P. Parasuram, left Gandhi\u2019s entourage when Gandhi refused to stop sharing a bed with Manu.\n\nGuha does as much as any reasonable biographer could to explain the \u201cexperiments\u201d with reference to Gandhi\u2019s 40-year obsession with celibacy. Ultimately, though, the reader is left feeling that Gandhi\u2019s own defenses of his behavior are riddled with self-justification, and Manu\u2019s voice may never truly be heard.\n\nGandhi posed a huge challenge to his world in his time, and still does. Guha\u2019s admiration for his subject is clear throughout this book. He tries to explain controversial aspects of Gandhi\u2019s life by contextualizing them within Gandhi\u2019s own thinking. Some of Gandhi\u2019s fiercer critics may feel this is soft-pedaling, but it does help build a fair, thorough and nuanced portrait of the man. Gandhi spoke for himself more than most people in history, but even the most controlling people cannot control how history sees them. Guha lets Gandhi appear on his own terms, and allows him to reveal himself in all his contradictions.\n\nThere is much truth in a verse Guha quotes, written by Gandhi\u2019s secretary, Mahadev Desai:",

From the famous gold mask of Agamemnon to the sinewy Artemision Bronze statue, pottery fragments to exquisite jewelry, the museum\u2019s timeless treasures stand as testaments to the longevity of art.\n\n8. 6 p.m. Raising the Roof\n\nIn central Athens, al fresco bo\u00eetes boasting views of the Acropolis and Lycabettus Hill grace countless rooftops of deceptively ordinary-looking cement blocks. One-year-old Anglais is particularly atmospheric, with fairy lights strung above a gregarious young crowd. A for Athens, off bustling Monastiraki Square, serves mythically titled drinks like Polyphemus the Cyclops, as well as a cobbler that features mastiha, the distinctly fragrant tree resin from Chios (\u20ac12).\n\n9. 8 p.m. Mezes and Dakos\n\nMismatched plates, vintage upholstery and Formica-topped tables may signal a hipster hangout, but the Cretan restaurant Aster has the substance to back up its quirky style. Dive into mezes like ginger-marinated salmon paired with lentil salad (\u20ac5.50) and fried meatballs topped with rich yogurt (\u20ac6). And don\u2019t miss dakos, Greece\u2019s answer to panzanella, with wedges of double-baked barley bread tossed with ripe tomatoes and creamy cheese (\u20ac4).\n\n10. 10 p.m. Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nWrap up your Saturday night in Psyrri, a former industrial district where hardware stores and design ateliers now coexist harmoniously. The leafy streets fanning out from Iroon Square are chockablock with rambunctious establishments that swing till dawn, but for an experience that best encapsulates how Psyrri toes that fine line between glamorous and grungy, head to Cantina Social. A coffee-sipping neighborly crowd gives way to an increasingly festive clientele as night goes on. To a soundtrack that can whiplash from obscure indie bands to unabashedly happy Latin pop, a diverse crowd of college students, media executives and, sometimes, drag queens, congregates in the courtyard where projections of old films turn the walls into pop art canvases.",

Recreational vehicles, trucks and even trains were pushed over, surrounded by new lakes of water.\n\nThe full extent of the damage and other casualties was uncertain: Governor Scott told CNN on Thursday that two hospitals in Panama City were damaged in the storm and were \u201cin the process of being closed down.\u201d\n\nHe said that temporary hospitals were being set up to treat people injured in the storm, but that \u201cwe don\u2019t know the numbers\u201d of injured yet.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern would be loss of life,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida said he had heard from local authorities who described extensive damage. \u201cThese are not people prone to hyperbole,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on CNN. \u201cPanama City is catastrophic damage. Someone told me, \u2018Mexico Beach is gone.\u2019\u201d\n\nResidents and emergency workers spent most of Wednesday hunkered down, and emerged only toward nightfall to begin assessing the storm\u2019s toll. As dusk approached, though, the early outlines of a vast calamity were unfolding.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t drive a car anywhere, you can\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s littered with houses, pieces of houses,\u201d said Patricia Mulligan, who rode out the storm with her family in a condo in Mexico Beach, a town of mom-and-pop shops and sport-fishing businesses about 35 miles southeast of Panama City.

  "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/magazine/kensington-heroin-opioid-philadelphia.html",
  "text": "I didn\u2019t go to Kensington at night on Code Blue days in December, when the temperatures were dangerously cold. But the addicts were still there. They set up burn barrels to keep fires going, and the city opened emergency warming rooms. Even when the temperatures dropped to single digits, many of the addicts refused go to a shelter. For some users, opioid withdrawal was worse than the possibility of freezing to death.\n\nThis January, Gov. Tom Wolf signed a statewide disaster declaration, the first of its kind for a public-health emergency in Pennsylvania. There had been more than 1,200 overdose deaths in Philadelphia in 2017 \u2014 a 34 percent rise from 2016. Wolf pushed the state to roll back regulations that might be stopping users from getting help, like ID and sobriety requirements for shelters and treatment facilities. Instead of sending overdosed people back out onto the street, the city hired recovery specialists in the E.R. to talk to them about treatment. It handed out tens of thousands of doses of Narcan. It sent a van into the neighborhood to offer recovery services. It gave residents blue light bulbs for their porches, because the light seemed to make it harder for heroin users to find a vein.\n\nShanta Schachter, a community development consultant who was hired by Conrail during the cleanup as a liaison between the company and neighborhood organizations, watched the new encampments grow throughout the winter. Months before the Conrail cleanup began, she attended community meetings and chatted with neighbors. She had encouraged residents to take control of Kensington by planting trees in vacant lots, building fences, painting abandoned buildings, installing streetlights. During the cleanup, she was hopeful, but after she drove through the tunnels, she was worried about the addicts living there. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an incredible amount of suffering,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people are getting better. There aren\u2019t resources to help the people who are addicted now. I don\u2019t think anybody really knows how to get the addicts off the streets. It can\u2019t just be new beds, or recovery services, or anything else. It has to be everything.\u201d\n\nThe city was willing to try almost anything. In January, the Department of Public Health announced that the city would \u201cencourage organizations to develop\u201d supervised-injection sites, where people can bring their own drugs without fear of arrest and inject under the care of a medical team. There are roughly 120 of these injection sites around the world \u2014 although none in the United States \u2014 and research has shown that they reduce overdose deaths, connect addicts to long-term care and help keep neighborhoods clean of needles. There has never been a fatal overdose at an official safe-injection site. The Justice Department made it clear that it would view any such place to be in violation of federal drug laws, but Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and Philadelphia mayor, threw his support behind a nonprofit group trying to establish one.\n\nAt one community meeting this March, city officials explained the idea to residents. The clinic would be located where the most overdose deaths occurred, and that very likely meant Kensington. Many of the overdose victims were white men, though, and some of the minority residents didn\u2019t think it was fair. They worried that establishing a supervised-injection site in the neighborhood would condemn it to a permanent future of drug use. Brooke Feldman, a social worker, had planned to bring a homeless user named Johnny to the meeting, but when she went to the Tulip Street underpass that morning, he had already died of an overdose. \u201cHe said he would use the site and wanted to be a part of the conversation,\u201d Feldman told me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even live to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nDan Martino, a community organizer who put together a march for overdose awareness, had been lobbying for a supervised-injection site for years. \u201cWe already have unsafe injection sites on every street corner in the city, and it\u2019s not working out,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to be easier to get help than heroin.\u201d\n\nIn February, on a concrete stoop on East Tusculum Street near the Kensington Avenue tunnel, two sisters, Nancy and Dawn, watched the addicts. Dawn wore a green T-shirt that read, \u201cDawn\u2019s drinking club,\u201d and her blond hair was high in a ponytail. \u201cAlmost everybody I grew up with is either an addict or dead,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like the only one.\u201d",

  "title": "Opinion | A Lesson for Kavanaugh From Another Tarnished Supreme Court Justice",
  "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/opinion/editorials/kavanaugh-thomas-nomination-lesson.html",
  "text": "Shortly after the president announced the nomination, rumors circulated that as a young lawyer in Alabama, Black had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The N.A.A.C.P. asked for an investigation, but a Senate Judiciary subcommittee rammed the nomination through to the full committee after two hours of consideration. One Democratic senator, William Dieterich of Illinois, accused other senators of trying to \u201cbesmirch\u201d Black\u2019s reputation. As the historian William E. Leuchtenberg described the scene in a fascinating 1973 article, \u201cDieterich\u2019s tirade nearly resulted in a fist fight\u201d as another Democratic senator charged at him.\n\nSupreme Court nominees did not ordinarily appear at their confirmation hearings in those days, but Black\u2019s supporters said he had assured them that he had never joined the Klan. The full committee moved the nomination to the Senate floor. Black was confirmed by a vote of 63 to 16, and the new justice and his wife set sail for a European vacation.\n\nIn mid-September, while Black was in Paris and the court was getting ready to open a new term, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published the first of six articles conclusively linking him to the Klan. Soon, the country was in an uproar. The Klan stood for violence not only against African-Americans but also against Catholics, who were prominent among Roosevelt\u2019s most loyal supporters. Catholic members of Congress demanded that Black step down. Senator David I. Walsh, a Democrat and a former governor of Massachusetts, charged that \u201cBlack obtained his nomination and confirmation by concealment and thereby deceived the president and his fellow senators, especially the latter.\u201d A Gallup poll found that 59 percent of the public believed Black should resign if the charge was true.\n\nOn his return to the United States, Black gave a national radio address, as unusual then as Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appearance on Fox News was this month. Carried by 300 stations on three radio networks, the speech attracted the second-biggest audience of the decade, outdone only by the abdication speech of King Edward VIII. Black conceded that he had joined the Klan and said he had resigned before he became a senator. He neither explained his decisions nor apologized for his membership. In fact, in Professor Leuchtenberg\u2019s account, \u201cHe spent the first third of his remarks cautioning against the possibility of a revival of racial and religious hatred, but he warned that this might be brought about not by groups like the Klan but by those who questioned his right to be on the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe national press excoriated the speech as thoroughly inadequate, but Roosevelt discerned accurately that \u201cit did the trick,\u201d as he told his confidant James Farley. A new Gallup Poll showed that a majority of Americans now believed that Black should not resign. He was on the bench when the new term opened three days after his speech, went on to serve for 34 years, one of the longest Supreme Court tenures, before retiring in 1971 at the age of 85.",

  "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014Three days after a Sunoco pipeline in Texas caught fire during welding work in 2016, a tiny government agency called the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board dispatched a team to investigate.\n\nBut its findings about the incident\u2014in which seven workers suffered severe burns\u2014are shaping up differently under President Trump than under President Obama, according to people familiar with the agency under both administrations.\n\nThe team originally drafted a report recommending mandatory safety standards for any company that does pipeline welding. But early this year, agency leadership removed the regulatory recommendation and told the research team instead to recommend voluntary changes to Sunoco LP, an agency investigator said. The final report has yet to be issued.\n\nInsiders at the board, including current and former investigators, say they have been encouraged to cut back on regulatory recommendations in the Trump era, and they point to the Sunoco incident as one example.\n\n\u201cThe drivers for doing investigations changed in 2017 with the new administration coming on,\u201d said Johnnie Banks, a former investigator who retired in December. Mr. Banks said his reports started receiving more scrutiny and he received more pushback on his recommendations. Others, speaking anonymously, expressed similar concerns.\n\n\u201cThey never hung (Mr. Trump\u2019s) picture but you always felt his presence there,\u201d Mr. Banks said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment for this article.\n\nChemical safety board member Kristen Kulinowski, the interim head of the agency, said it hasn\u2019t been in communication with the White House and hasn\u2019t felt pressure to change its approach.\n\n\u201cThe independence of the agency is incredibly important,\u201d Ms. Kulinowski said. \u201cWe need to maintain that same level of technical rigor and same approach to our investigations no matter who\u2019s in the White House. And we\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\nIn the Sunoco case, CSB Senior Adviser Tom Zoeller said it is common for recommendations to change as various investigators respond to drafts and said the draft hasn\u2019t yet been submitted to the board for a formal review. Sunoco didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigates incidents ranging from chemical plant accidents to oil spills, such as the one caused by the deadly 2010 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off Louisiana.\n\nThe board doesn\u2019t issue any regulations, but it makes suggestions to larger agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Among dozens of Obama-era rules Mr. Trump is trying to repeal is an EPA requirement, which is based on a chemical safety board recommendation, that chemical plants institute more safeguards to protect against explosions.\n\nPresident Trump has twice sought to abolish the chemical safety board, arguing it has been too ready to call for new rules, and duplicates the work of other agencies.\n\nRelated Rules Established After Deepwater Horizon Disaster Face Revisions (April 27)\n\nCongress has blocked the White House effort. This year, a House committee proposed increasing the board\u2019s budget, and the Senate also moved to keep the agency.\n\nIndustry groups say the work of the chemical safety board is essential. The American Chemistry Council said its members \u201cfind considerable value in the CSB\u2019s work\u2014especially the reports and materials generated by the board as part of its investigations.\u201d\n\nYet the agency, insiders and watchdogs say, is suffering under the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s more sort of malign neglect rather than active hostility,\u201d said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an advocacy group that has filed lawsuits against the safety board. He said the agency was trying to \u201clay low\u201d to avoid further antagonizing the administration.\n\nAbout half of the board\u2019s investigators have quit since Mr. Trump took office, leaving it with 10 official investigators as of early September, according to the agency. Some of those who stayed say they are having to take time more time away from investigations to talk to lawmakers to make sure funding continues.\n\n\u201cBudget uncertainty impedes the CSB\u2019s ability to attract, hire and retain staff,\u201d the EPA inspector general, which also provide oversight for the agency, said in a June report.\n\nMs. Kulinowski said congressional support has improved the situation. She cited a 2017 employee survey that showed employee satisfaction jumped 21% from the previous year.\n\nHowever, staff members say managers pressured them to give positive responses because the board\u2019s future was at risk. An internal survey conducted anonymously in February and obtained by The Wall Street Journal was filled with negative feedback. Staff said management didn\u2019t communicate with them, that proposed elimination was still a major issue and that key work was being sidelined.\n\n\u201cStaff is intimidated and does not raise concerns to management,\u201d one respondent wrote. \u201cInvestigations are also less important to the board than outreach and advocacy,\u201d one respondent wrote.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMs. Kulinowski said she has told staff that they shouldn\u2019t shy away from large-scale investigations or from regulatory recommendations. \u201cIn my first all hands meeting after I was named the interim executive, I communicated to staff my vision,\u201d she said. \u201cI talked about big investigations not being off the table.\u201d\n\nMs. Kulinowski is a placeholder leader for the agency, as Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t named a chairman or nominated any board members. Two of five board seats are vacant. Terms for two of the remaining board members, both Obama appointees, expire in 2019. If Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t nominate anyone, the expiring terms could leave the board nearly empty.\n\nMeanwhile, staff say more investigations appear to be getting a softer treatment.\n\nStaff say an investigation into an Oklahoma gas-well blowout in January that killed five workers is addressing technical safety failures but ignoring broader issues\u2014such as safety training for contract workers\u2014which would be more likely to prompt regulatory recommendations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we have the political will to do it, and we definitely don\u2019t have the capacity to do that now,\u201d one staffer said. Mr. Zoeller said the safety board conducts these types of broader investigations regularly, including any time there is a question of worker training. Red Mountain Energy LLC, the well operator, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nWrite to Heidi Vogt at heidi.vogt@wsj.com",

  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAs Hurricane Michael menaced the Florida Panhandle with howling winds and dangerous surf, residents riding out the storm in the popular resort town of Panama City Beach witnessed just how damaging it could be.\n\nVideos on social media showed 155-mph winds ripping tarps off roofs, new housing on the beach collapsing into the encroaching waves and buildings completely flattened or covered in debris.\n\n\"The resort next to us is completely demolished,\" said Lisa Dawn Parker, 51, who has lived in Panama City Beach for almost three years and took cover along with her boyfriend in a friend's apartment near the beach.\n\n\"The windows are blown out. The whole front of it's gone,\" she said in a phone interview with NBC News Wednesday after the storm hit.\n\n\"We didn't think it was going to be worse than [Hurricane] Ivan,\" she said. \"We don't know why we stayed.\"\n\nShe said there was \"lots and lots of wind and debris,\" and that \"the rest of the beach is getting tattered with waves. The water looks like it's gone up to the dunes from here.\"\n\nThe hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 155 mph when it made landfall Wednesday morning, making it a Category 4 \u2014 but it has since been downgraded to tropical storm. Two people have been confirmed killed: A man died when a tree fell on a residence in Greensboro, Florida, and an 11-year-old girl died in Seminole County, Georgia, when she was struck in the head by part of a metal carport that crashed into the roof of her home, authorities said.\n\nNow-Tropical Storm Michael made landfall as the strongest hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. More than 338,000 customers in Florida and 343,000 in Georgia were reported to be without power. Another 125,000 people were without power in the Carolinas and Alabama.\n\n\"I've been here all my life and I've never seen the water hit the end of the pier the way that it's doing,\" Panama City Beach Mayor Mike Thomas told MSNBC before the storm made landfall Wednesday afternoon near Mexico Beach, a sparsely populated town about 28 miles to the southeast.\n\nHe said he was disheartened that a number of the town's 12,000 residents failed to evacuate ahead in time, instead choosing to shelter in place. Even if they wanted to, all of the bridges in the county were deemed unsafe and closed earlier Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"If you're going to live in a beautiful place, there's always some kind of problem with it, and this is truly beautiful, even now ... it's just a shame [the hurricane is] so destructive,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe Gulf Coast resort town \u2014 and the larger destination of neighboring Panama City \u2014 has beckoned vacationers and spring break partiers for decades with its emerald waters and sugar white sands. Last year saw a record 17 million visitors to Panama City Beach, bringing in $2.8 billion worth of economic activity, according to a local tourism report in March.\n\nMTV's \"Jersey Shore\" spin off, \"Floribama Shore,\" is also filmed in Panama City Beach.\n\nMichael is now the first threat of its magnitude to strike the area since record-keeping began more than 165 years ago. Since then, no Category 4 storm or higher has ever hit the Florida Panhandle, researchers say.\n\nIn addition, Michael's peak winds at landfall were the fourth strongest on record for a hurricane slamming the U.S. mainland, just behind Andrew in 1992, Camille in 1969 and the biggest \u2014 an unnamed storm in 1935.\n\nObservers are concerned this one will shred pockets of the treasured coastline, part of a larger 100-mile stretch dubbed the Emerald Coast. High-rise condos and homes dot the beaches.\n\n\"This is absolutely going to devastate Panama City Beach,\" said Jason Senkbeil, a University of Alabama associate professor of geography who has researched hurricane evacuees.\n\nCameron Sadowski walks through crashing surf on the beach as the outer bands of Hurricane Michael arrive on Oct. 10, 2018 in Panama City Beach, Florida. Joe Raedle / Getty Images\n\nAbnormally warm waters in the Gulf this October has fueled Michael.\n\n\"There's lots of damage in my neighborhood,\" Sarah Shelley, a lifelong resident of Panama City which is near Panama City Beach, said in a phone interview with MSNBC Wednesday afternoon, describing rainy and windy conditions even after the monster storm hit.\n\n\"We weren\u2019t quite expecting it to get quite so strong so quick,\" she said, although she added that her home is in a \"pretty high area\" outside of flood zones. Still, her back porch and carport blew away in the fierce winds, she said.\n\nLike many in the region, Shelley lost power, but she said they have food and water and her parents who live up the street have an RV so they can cook food if necessary in the hurricane\u2019s aftermath.\n\nBesides tourism, Senkbeil said the local agricultural industry, which includes peanuts and cotton, could suffer now because it's harvest time.\n\n\"There's going to be a high-dollar value in terms of economic farm loss,\" he added.\n\nIn addition, the area is laced with two-lane roads and pine trees. Heavy winds could block access to streets as well as isolated fishing villages.\n\n\"Those pine trees are tall and skinny, and they're gonna snap like twigs under 150-mph winds,\" Senkbeil said.\n\nMegan Williams, from left, and roommate Kaylee O'Brian take belongings from their destroyed home after several trees fell on the house during Hurricane Michael in Panama City, Fla., on Oct. 10, 2018. Gerald Herbert / AP\n\nOsama Albibi said he, his wife and three young children evacuated Tuesday night from Panama City Beach to Panama City to stay with family ahead of the storm.\n\nAlbibi, a 40-year-old financial adviser with Merrill Lynch, said he's most worried about his parents, both 68, who decided to stay behind in Panama City Beach. Their home is about 12 feet above sea level \u2014 but the storm surge is predicted to top that.\n\n\"I feel that they're taking it maybe a little lightly,\" Albibi said. \"I tried to explain to them that this isn't similar to any type of hurricane.\"\n\nIn Southport, Florida, just north of Panama City, Daniel Dean described widespread damage and debris.\n\n\"There are trees \u2014 I mean trees on top of trees on top of trees on top of trees \u2014 that are just piled up in the roads,\" Dean said in a phone interview on MSNBC Wednesday afternoon. \"There are power lines crossing the road,\" he said.\n\n\"Right now it is just catastrophic out here in Southport ... we have garage doors that have been smashed in,\" he said, adding that the entire roof of a church had been ripped off.\n\n\"There\u2019s flooding everywhere,\" Dean said. \"I have never seen anything like this in my entire life in the Panhandle region, ever.\"\n\nIn Callaway, a town of around 14,000 just east of Panama City, Doug Jones was in his home when a tree fell on it, completely destroying the structure.\n\n\"I was in the living room and heard a huge cracking noise,\" Jones, 50, who is a traffic technician for Bay County and said he stayed because he was on call for work, said in a phone interview. \"All of a sudden, the roof came down. I had to jump into the hallway so it didn't fall on me.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to save what I can. The house can be rebuilt, but our photos and everything are getting soaking wet,\" Jones said, becoming emotional.\n\nAlthough Jones is a Florida native who has lived through many, many hurricanes, he said this storm was particularly bad.\n\n\"This is the worst hurricane I've ever been through,\" Jones said.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nTwo people were killed as Tropical Storm Michael moved across Florida and Georgia early Thursday, hours after it made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.\n\n\"The nation has watched as this storm has devastated the Panhandle,\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said on Wednesday evening, but he promised: \"Hurricane Michael cannot break Florida.\"\n\nA man was killed when a tree fell on a residence in Greensboro, Florida, Sgt. Anglie Hightower, a spokeswoman for the Gadsden County Sheriff's Office, told NBC News.\n\nAnd an 11-year-old girl was killed near Lake Seminole, Georgia, when a metal carport used for boats was picked up by wind, crashed through the roof of the house she was in and struck her in the head, said Travis Brooks, director of emergency management for Seminole County.\n\nThe girl's grandfather was also in the house but wasn't injured, Brooks said. He added that the emergency call came in on Wednesday afternoon, but responders weren't able to get to the home until early Wednesday morning because \"the roads were so messed up.\"\n\nMichael weakened to a tropical storm after midnight, but it remained dangerous almost 11 hours after it crossed land as a Category 4 hurricane near Mexico Beach, Florida, about 20 miles southeast of Panama City, at around 1:30 p.m. ET with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph.\n\nAt 5 a.m. ET, the storm was about 30 miles west of Augusta, Georgia, with life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds of 50 mph, the National Weather Service said. Hurricane and storm surgewarnings for the Gulf Coast of Florida were canceled early Thursday, but remained in effect for parts of Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nThe latest on the storm:\n\nMichael weakened to a tropical storm, with top sustained winds of 50 mph, and hurricane warnings for the Florida Gulf Coast were canceled.\n\nAn unidentified man was killed when a tree fell on a home in Gadsden County, Florida.\n\nAn 11-year-old child was killed by a metal carport in Seminole County, Georgia.\n\nMore than 340,000 customers in Florida and 343,000 in Georgia were without power. More than 125,000 were without power in Alabama and the Carolinas.\n\nMichael Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, called Michael a \"history-making, very devastating storm and one that we're never going to forget.\"\n\nThe weather service said the core of Michael moved across southwestern and central Georgia overnight. It's expected to head northeastward through the Carolinas and into Virginia Thursday before turning off into the mid-Atlantic coast by early Friday. Up to nine inches of rain was expected to hit isolated areas in North Carolina and Virginia, which could cause life-threatening flash floods.\n\n\"We've got a little ways to go with this system,\" Graham said on MSNBC. \"We're telling people this isn't over with.\"\n\nMichael was one of the worst storms the Panhandle had ever faced even before it made landfall. As the eye moved over the area, the National Weather Service warned people not to go outside in the \"relative calm\" because winds would pick up swiftly.\n\n\"The historical record, going back to 1851, finds no Category 4 hurricane ever hitting the Florida Panhandle,\" Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist for the National Hurricane Center, wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday.\n\nStorm surge could be most catastrophic on the Florida coast, at nine to 14 feet. \"The water will come miles inshore and can easily rise over the roofs of houses,\" Scott said, adding that even two feet of storm surge could be deadly.\n\nLisa Dawn Parker, 51, decided to stay behind in Panama City Beach with her boyfriend. They watched from a sixth-floor apartment as winds tore the roof off of a beach resort.\n\n\"The resort next to us is completely demolished,\" Parker said. \"The windows are blown out. The whole front of it's gone.\"\n\n\"We didn't think it was going to be worse than Ivan,\" a scared Parker said, referring to the 2004 hurricane that killed more than 50 people across the Southeast. \"We don't know why we stayed.\"\n\nMore than 375,000 residents in dozens of Florida counties were under evacuation orders Wednesday, but Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said some residents didn't have time to flee.\n\n\"If you failed to heed a warning for any reason, your goal should be to elevate as high as you can and get into a facility that you think can withstand the winds at this point and hope for the best,\" Long said. \"Those who stick around to experience storm surge don't typically live to tell about it, unfortunately.\"\n\nAt least 10 military bases, home to about 700,000 service members and their families, are in the region, the Defense Department said. The Pentagon said it had readied thousands of forces, including high-water vehicles and helicopters, to come to residents' aid if needed.\n\nTyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, said it took a direct hit and had sustained extensive damage.\n\nThe base, which ordered a mandatory evacuation on Monday and evacuated its jets on Tuesday, said in a statement that the condition of its runway couldn't be determined.\n\n\"Base officials do not have an estimate at this time for when it will be safe to return,\" authorities said.\n\nBrad Kieserman, vice president of disaster operations for Red Cross, said about 6,000 people were already in shelters in five states, about 5,000 of them in Florida.\n\nKieserman told reporters that he wouldn't be surprised more than 20,000 people were in shelters by Thursday or Friday.\n\n\"It's bad,\" Franklin County Sheriff A.J. \"Tony\" Smith said in an interview as he surveyed damage in Apalachicola. \"If you've been around town, you've seen all the trees that are down, all the roads that are blocked downtown the flooding,\" Smith said. \"For us, this is catastrophic.\"\n\nA Weather Channel crew even tried to leave its base in Apalachicola but couldn't because storm conditions made it impossible to drive, meteorologist Mike Bettes said on Twitter.\n\nThe Bay County Sheriff's Office issued a shelter-in-place order early Wednesday, and the county's Department of Emergency Services said officers could no longer respond to calls.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tallahassee, about 20 miles inland, said: \"It's about too late to find shelters with #Michael moving in right now. The best thing to do is find shelter in your own place away from any windows.\"\n\nOfficials also shut down the Hathaway Bridge, which connects Panama City and Panama City Beach and is a main route in and out of the cities.\n\nA National Weather Service forecast map shows Tropical Storm Michael tracking through the Southeast. NOAA\n\nTorrential rains, destructive winds and possible tornadoes will also extend well inland, forecasters said, and parts of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and the Carolinas will likely be hard-hit. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 108 counties.\n\nIn North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper issued a state of emergency ahead of Michael. Tropical storm warnings and storm surge watches were issued for parts of the coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The state was pummeled last month by the deadly Hurricane Florence.\n\nPeter Macias, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said about 4,000 people entered nearly 70 evacuation centers across the Florida Panhandle and Alabama overnight.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed the emergency declaration requested by Scott for 35 Florida counties. Scott said Wednesday morning that he had updated the president on the storm and that Trump had offered any necessary resources \"as we prepare to respond to this massive and catastrophic storm.\"\n\nGovernment offices were closed in those 35 counties. While Tuesday was the deadline for Floridians to register to vote, residents will be allowed to register on the day those offices reopen, the Florida secretary of state's office said in a statement. The state Democratic Party filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying that the one-day extension was insufficient and confusing.",

  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFor more than a week before it made landfall, meteorologists were sounding alarm bells about Florence, the devastating hurricane that slammed into the Carolinas on Sept. 14.\n\nYet with Michael \u2014 the powerful hurricane that made landfall as a Category 4 storm in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday \u2014 word of the storm came just days in advance.\n\nThe reason why, according to forecasters: Unlike Florence, which formed off of Africa long before it arrived on U.S. shores, Michael just originated in the southwest Caribbean \u2014 closer and fewer days before landfall.\n\nKrystal Day, of Homosassa, Fla., left, leads a sandbag assembly line at the Old Port Cove restaurant in Ozello, Florida, on Oct. 9, 2018. Employees were hoping to protect the restaurant from floodwaters as Hurricane Michael continues to churn in the Gulf of Mexico heading for the Florida panhandle. Chris O'Meara / AP\n\nStill, Michael was \"no surprise,\" according to NBC News meteorologist Sherri Pugh.\n\n\"The position difference changes your forecast lead time,\" she said. \"That's why we could see Florence coming across. We were tracking what it would be for days. With Michael, we still had the same amount of information; it just formed closer.\"\n\nMichael made landfall with winds of 155 mph. The fast-moving storm is the first Category 4 on record to hit the panhandle in more than 150 years. Evacuation orders were issued earlier in the week.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned in a tweet, \"The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone. First responders will not be able to come out in the middle of the storm. If you chose to stay in an evacuation zone, you must SEEK REFUGE IMMEDIATELY.\"\n\nJoel Cline, a meteorologist and tropical program coordinator of the National Weather Service, said that while Michael's shorter starting distance from the U.S. coast meant there wasn't as much time to issue guidance, \"that doesn't mean that the people there aren't well-warned.\"\n\n\"Things just don't sneak up on forecasters anymore,\" he said. \"There's enough to see there, but then the cause is just the sheer distance. Maybe instead of two weeks [notice] ... they only have four days.\"\n\nWorkers board the windows of Marco's Pizza in Panama City Beach, Florida, as Hurricane Michael approaches on Oct. 9, 2018 . Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images\n\nRegardless, psychologists say more advanced notice and more warnings to evacuate don't necessarily translate into people heeding warnings better.\n\n\"I think everybody expects weather to be a little bit unpredictable, and if we get too much notice about something, we discount it a little bit,\" said Pamela Rutledge, the director of the Media Psychology Research Center, a nonprofit that applies psychology to media and technology behaviors.\n\nAnd as long as there is something to back up the idea that a threat is imminent \u2014 others around them heeding evacuation orders, multiple news sources or forecasters telling them that danger is headed their way \u2014 people will start taking precautions to avoid the danger, no matter how much notice they are given, Rutledge added.\n\nBut less notice means less time to prepare, she noted.\n\n\"So everyone has to go to the store and buy what's left of the water, whereas if there's weeks to prepare, the stores can stock. There's more ability to help the people prepare,\" Rutledge said.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season starts in June and peaks around Labor Day, Cline said, and runs into November, or, rarely, December. Michael is considered a late-season hurricane, and it is typical for late-season storms to originate exactly where Michael did \u2014 in the southwest Caribbean Sea before moving into the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 as opposed to off of Africa, where hurricanes earlier in the season form.\n\n\"As the season goes on, of course things tend to get cooler in the middle part of the ocean, and so therefore those don't sustain themselves,\" Cline said of systems off of Africa. \"Maybe you get a tropical storm or a depression, but it never really forms to this gigantic hurricane.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the waters in the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 more shallow \u2014 tend to be warmer, providing a more suitable environment for storm systems later in the season.\n\nIt is not unheard of for a late-season hurricane to eye the Florida Panhandle. Notable ones include Hurricane Kate, which made landfall as a Category 2 storm in November 1985. And in October 1995, Hurricane Opal hit as a Category 3.",

  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi checked his cellphone just before entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week, but never read messages sent to him minutes later, screenshots obtained by NBC News show.\n\nThe screenshots of WhatsApp messages sent to Khashoggi by a friend in the U.S. corroborate the timeline of his disappearance, providing further evidence that he did not leave the consulate, as Saudi Arabia's government has claimed.\n\nKhashoggi's fianc\u00e9, Hatice Cengiz, has said he left a cellphone with her before entering the consulate. It's unclear whether that's the same cellphone to which the unread messages were sent. Reports in foreign news outlets have said Khashoggi left one cellphone with his fianc\u00e9 but carried another into the consulate, and a person close to Khashoggi's family told NBC News that was indeed a possibility.\n\nEither way, the unread messages indicate that after entering the consulate, Khashoggi never regained access to the cellphone that he used regularly to communicate with friends and others in the U.S. The Virginia phone number is the same one that NBC News had used in the past to arrange interviews with Khashoggi.\n\nTwo WhatsApp screenshots obtained by NBC News from a friend of Jamal Khashoggi in the Pacific Time Zone of the U.S. show Khashoggi was \"last seen\" on WhatsApp at 3:06 a.m. Pacific (1:06 p.m. Istanbul). At left, a text sent by the friend on Monday, Oct. 1, 2018 to Khashoggi at 12:25 p.m. Pacific (10:25 p.m. Istanbul) was read (two blue checks). At right, a text sent by the friend on Tuesday, Oct. 2 to Khashoggi at 3:24 a.m. Pacific (1:24 p.m. Istanbul) was delivered, but was not read (two gray checks). NBC News\n\nThe WhatsApp messages consist of links to news articles sent by the friend to Khashoggi about Saudi Arabia, including some critical of the government led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One was a link to a piece in the magazine The American Conservative entitled \"The Increasingly Repressive 'New' Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nScreenshots from the sender's phone show that a message sent to Khashoggi the night before, at 10:25 p.m. Istanbul-time on Oct. 1, was read. WhatsApp uses two blue check marks to indicate messages that have been seen by the recipient.\n\nLater messages sent to Khashoggi show that he was \"last seen\" on WhatsApp on Oct. 2 at 1:06 p.m. Istanbul-time. The \"last seen\" feature reveals when a WhatsApp user was last online and using the encrypted messaging application.\n\nEight minutes later, Khashoggi entered the consulate in Istanbul at 1:14 p.m., according to the timestamp on CCTV footage that shows him walking into the building.\n\nA message sent to him at 1:24 p.m. was delivered to his phone but was never read, indicated by two gray check marks next to the message.\n\nThe friend who sent Khashoggi the text messages was in the Western part of the U.S., so the time stamps on the screenshots are in Pacific Daylight Time \u2014 10 hours behind Istanbul. The sender agreed to share the information on condition of anonymity out of concern for the sender's safety.\n\nThe new details about Khashoggi's text messages come amid a swirl of new, macabre reports and conflicting information about what happened to Khashoggi, complicating global efforts to determine his whereabouts and whether he's still alive.\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi citizen and critic of the government who wrote in The Washington Post, entered the consulate last Tuesday to obtain documents needed for his upcoming marriage to Cengiz, a Turkish citizen. Saudi Arabia has maintained that he left the consulate, but has not provided any proof.\n\nLate Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that Crown Prince Mohammed had ordered an operation to lure Kashoggi to Saudi Arabia from Virginia, where he resides, citing \"U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan.\" But the officials weren't clear whether the Saudis discussed harming Khashoggi or merely detaining him, the report said. NBC News has not had access to the intercepts.\n\nSaudi Arabia's ambassador to the U.S. told Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., that consulate security cameras that would have captured his departure were not recording. But an individual familiar with Saudi embassy operations and protocol says that claim \"raises questions.\"\n\n\"The Saudis take security at diplomatic posts very seriously, especially in a complex security environment like Istanbul,\" the individual said. \"If the cameras were not working, it could have been a violation of security protocol.\"\n\nOver the weekend Turkish authorities told NBC News and other news organizations that police believed Khashoggi had been killed inside the consulate. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said it's Saudi Arabia's responsibility to prove that he truly left the consulate.\n\nOn Wednesday, three people familiar with the investigation told NBC News that Turkish officials had told the U.S. that Turkey had listening devices inside the Saudi consulate, giving the Turks at least some insight into what transpired inside.\n\nJamal Khashoggi speaks at an event in London on Sept. 29. Middle East Monitor / Reuters\n\nThe case has drawn increasing concern from leaders in the U.S., including President Donald Trump, who is pledging to \"get to the bottom\" of his disappearance. John Bolton, the national security adviser, and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner spoke this week to Crown Prince Mohammed seeking information about Khashoggi, the White House said, as did Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\"It's a very bad situation,\" Trump said. \"And we want to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nCorker and other senators on the Foreign Relations panel sent Trump a letter Wednesday giving the president three months to determine whether Saudi Arabia violated the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which prohibits extrajudicial killings, torture and other egregious rights violations. A determination that Saudi Arabia did violate the act would trigger sanctions on Saudi Arabia unless Trump specifically waives them.\n\nCorker and some other senators have been given access to a classified intelligence report regarding Khashoggi's case. After reading the report, Corker said he couldn't divulge its details, but told NBC News there was \"no question\" that it confirmed his skepticism about Saudi Arabia's explanations.\n\nKhashoggi's disappearance has brought renewed scrutiny to the Saudi government's increasingly aggressive efforts to silence its critics. Trump and other Western leaders have praised Crown Prince Mohammed for pursuing ambitious reforms aimed at modernizing the country and its economy, but there have been growing concerns about other freedoms for Saudis violated in the process.",

It added that Hague and Ovchinin would be transported to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City outside of Moscow, Russia.\n\nRussian agency Interfax said there was an \u201cemergency shutdown of second-stage engines\u201d when the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft launched.\n\nU.S. astronaut Nick Hague, right and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin prior to the launch of Soyuz MS-10 space ship at the Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on Oct. 11, 2018.

Crew rescued,\" he posted on Twitter.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov told reporters that the country would suspend manned space launches pending the investigation into the rocket failure.\n\n\"True, this is an unpleasant situation,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the emergency system has confirmed its reliability, which is very important.\"\n\nNASA said the safety of the crew was its \"utmost priority,\" and that a thorough investigation into the cause of the incident would be conducted.\n\n\"I\u2019m grateful that everyone is safe,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said on Twitter.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian President Vladimir Putin would be briefed on all necessary information.\n\n\"Thank God, the astronauts are alive according to information that we receive, and that\u2019s the most important thing,\" he said.\n\nThursday was the first space mission for Hague, who joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2013. Ovchinin spent six months on the International Space Station in 2016.\n\nElena Holodny reported from Moscow; Saphora Smith, Tony Brown, Carolin Sri-Narayana and Nick Bailey from London.",

  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nERIE, Pa. \u2014 President Donald Trump directly accused Hillary Clinton of engaging in a conspiracy with Russia to affect the 2016 election during a campaign rally here Wednesday night.\n\n\"There was collusion between Hillary, the Democrats and Russia,\" Trump said, just after his supporters had chanted \"lock her up\" about Clinton. \"There was a lot of collusion with them and Russia and lots of other people.\"\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating whether Trump or his operation colluded with Russia or obstructed justice afterward. But Trump allies in Congress and on cable news programs have argued that Democrats, Justice Department and FBI officials and the Clinton campaign conspired to frame him.\n\nTrump has discussed that theory publicly and on Twitter, but his remarks Wednesday night amounted to an unusually direct allegation that Clinton herself conspired with the Russian government to influence the election. He offered no evidence of his claim.\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said Trump is in fantasy land.\n\n\u201cDelusion, not collusion,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump arrived at the Erie Insurance Arena as part of a barnstorming campaign in the final weeks before November's midterm elections just hours after Hurricane Michael barreled into the Florida coastline as a Category 4 storm. Trump told reporters he didn't want to disappoint his supporters by canceling the event, and he said at the rally that his administration is prepared to handle the aftermath of the storm.\n\n\"We are all set to go,\" he said.\n\nErie County, situated on the Great Lake of the same name, has a special place in Trump lore because its voters flipped from supporting Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections to giving him a boost as he became the first Republican to win the state since 1988.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania on October 10, 2018. Leah Millis / Reuters\n\nTrump won the county by two percentage points after Obama took it by 17 points in 2012.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, Erie county is a bellwether for the nation. It's a classic example of the type of districts that Trump managed to win in key areas around the Great Lakes: industrial past, struggling manufacture sector, fairly high degree of poverty and, more recently, there has been high unemployment,\u201d said Joseph Morris, chair of the political science department at Mercyhurst University in Erie.\n\nMorris, who also conducts a poll of Erie County, found that in 2017, just a year after Trump\u2019s election, the president\u2019s popularity was already on the decline. Just 32 percent of voters approved of Trump, while 55 percent said they disapproved.\n\n\u201cWhat I found with our poll is that Trump's approval rating, even just a few weeks after the election, was not good in Erie County. In subsequent months, his approval rating dropped even further. So what that tells me is I think it had everything to do with Hillary Clinton and that is the way I explained Donald Trump\u2019s victory here,\u201d Morris said.\n\nSome voters interviewed by NBC News at the rally Wednesday night said they're open to voting for a Democrat over Trump in the next election.\n\n\u201cI voted for Obama because I liked the message of change and moving forward, but I saw the opposite from him,\u201d said Lauren Wienckowski, who cast her ballot for Trump in 2016. \u201cIt is going to be interesting to see who the Democrats pick in 2020 \u2014 will it be anger and rage or a more moderate route? I will keep an open mind in 2020, but it will just depend on who they pick.\u201d\n\nFrustration with Obama on foreign policy was the reason Matt Vargo, who works at an area high school, gave for turning to Trump two years ago. He, too, said he hasn't made up his mind about the president's re-election bid.\n\n\"I want to see who else is running,\" he said. \"I like to look at the whole thing, get the whole picture before I say anything.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania on October 10, 2018. Leah Millis / Reuters\n\nTrump was ostensibly in Erie to campaign for a series of candidates, including Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., who is running for U.S. Senate, GOP gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner, and Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, who is the local congressman.\n\nBut Barletta and Wagner are trailing badly in polls, and Kelly, whose race is considered somewhat competitive by most prognosticators, has a 95 percent chance of winning, according to FiveThirtyEight.com.\n\nMichael Caputo, who worked as a campaign aide to Trump in 2016 and remains a vocal surrogate in the media, said Trump was able to take care of multiple goals with the appearance here.\n\nHe wanted to show loyalty to candidates who have backed him, the buzz from his rally reached media markets in eastern Ohio and western New York, where there are additional competitive races, and he knows how important Erie County was to his victory in Pennsylvania and how significant the state will be in determining his electoral fate in two years.\n\n\"It's also important for the president to shore up Pennsylvania for 2020, and Erie PA is Trump country,\" Caputo said.\n\nHe also noted that Trump was not too far from the district of New York Rep. Chris Collins, a Trump loyalist who is seeking re-election despite being under indictment.\n\n\"There is no way on God\u2019s green earth that the president is going to come to NY-27 because of that situation,\" but the spillover effect of media coverage could have a \"marginal impact\" on Collins' race, Caputo said.\n\nLauren Egan reported from Erie. Jonathan Allen reported from Washington.",

  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe operator of the limousine company whose vehicle was involved in the fatal crash that killed 20 people Saturday in upstate New York has been arrested and charged with criminally negligent homicide, state police told NBC News.\n\nNauman Hussain, the operator of Prestige Limousine, was taken into custody after a traffic stop on Wednesday, New York State Police said. He was charged with a single count of criminally negligent homicide, but the charge lists all 20 victims, police said.\n\nLate Wednesday he pleaded not guilty and was released after posting bond, according to NBC News affiliate WNYT in Albany. He turned over his passport as a condition of release.\n\nNauman Hussain's father, Shahed Hussain \u2014 who has worked as an FBI informant \u2014 owns Prestige Limousine, of Gansevort, New York, according to the company's attorney. Earlier this week, police said Shahed Hussain \u2014 who has not been charged with a crime \u2014 was in Pakistan at the time of the accident and noted they have no authority to ask the elder Hussain to return to the United States.\n\n\"The sole responsibility for that motor vehicle being on the road on Saturday rests with Nauman Hussain,\" New York State Police Superintendent George Beach said during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nLee Kindon, of the Kindon Law Firm, which represents Prestige Limousine, said in a separate news conference after the arrest that state police had \"jumped the gun\" in charging his client, adding that while Nauman helped his father run the business, Shahed Hussain ran the company's day-to-day operations and owned the company's bank accounts.\n\n\"He's terrified. Hasn't eaten in three days. Hasn't slept in three days,\" Kindon said of Nauman. \"He\u2019s got the eyes of the world looking at him because they want someone to blame. He's gotten death threats.\"\n\nNauman Hussain, from left, the operator of a limousine company that owned the vehicle involved in a crash that killed 20 people in upstate New York, leaves with his lawyer Lee Kindlon, from right, after posting bond at Cobleskill Town Court in Cobleskill, New York on October 10, 2018. Cindy Schultz / Reuters\n\nOn Wednesday evening a vigil for victims was held in the gym of Schoharie Central School.\n\nThe names of the deceased were read, each followed by by the ring of a bell. About a half-dozen first responders engaged in a group hug. \"Amazing Grace\" was played on the bagpipe.\n\nAttending the vigil, New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul asked, \"In the aftermath, can we be better people?\"\n\nShe said only God knows why the accident happened \"but we're going to find out how.\"\n\nShe added, \"individuals who broke the law perhaps are going to be brought to justice.\"\n\nThe crash occurred Saturday afternoon when the driver of the 2001 Ford Excursion failed to stop at an intersection in Schoharie, New York, and careened into a parking lot before slamming into an unoccupied SUV, striking pedestrians, authorities said. Twenty people, including the driver of the Excursion and two pedestrians, were killed.\n\nOn Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the limousine failed an inspection last month and should not have been on the road. Cuomo also said the driver, Scott Lisinicchia, 53, did not have the specific documentation \u2014 a commercial driver's license with a passenger endorsement \u2014 required to drive the limo.\n\nNBC News obtained records showing that the limo had been cited numerous times for safety violations, including having \"brakes out of service.\" Lisinicchia's family has said he had complained about the safety of the vehicle.\n\nThe citation for the breaks, which was issued after a March 21 inspection, indicated that 20 percent or more of the roughly five-ton \"stretch\" limo's stopping power was compromised.\n\nA preliminary hearing on the allegations against Hussain was scheduled for Oct. 23.",

  "text": "Get the Mach newsletter.\n\nBefore humans venture to Mars, NASA wants to send astronauts back to the moon \u2014 and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin has developed a new lunar lander concept designed to shuttle space flyers between a moon-orbiting space station and the cratered surface below.\n\nUnveiled Oct. 3 at an international space conference in Bremen, Germany, the reusable lander would launch into space aboard NASA\u2019s next-generation Space Launch System rocket and dock with the agency\u2019s proposed Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway.\n\nThis planned outpost is a small moon-orbiting space station that NASA aims to build in the 2020s to serve as a way station for missions to the moon, as well as Mars and other deep-space destinations.\n\nThe reusable lander would be able to carry a four-person crew and 2,000 pounds of cargo. Courtesy Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed\u2019s lander would be able to carry a four-person crew and 2,000 pounds of cargo on lunar expeditions lasting up to two weeks \u2014 capabilities that far outstrip those of the Apollo-era \"lunar modules,\" said Tim Cichan, a space exploration architect at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver. Those single-use crafts carried two crew members to the moon for visits of less than a week \u2014 less than a single day in the case of the Apollo 11 astronauts, who were the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface.\n\n\u201cWhat is exciting and innovative is that these are reusable, unlike what we had during Apollo,\u201d Jack Burns, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said of the concept in an email to NBC News MACH. \u201cThe landers come down to the surface, potentially refuel using hydrogen and oxygen mined from water at the lunar poles and return to the Gateway.\"\n\nBurns, who is unaffiliated with the Lockheed Martin initiative, called the new lander a \u201cmore efficient, cost-effective system that will make the lunar surface regularly accessible from the lunar Gateway.\u201d\n\nSince the lander would depart for the moon from the Gateway, it would be able to reach any region of the lunar surface \u2014 including the poles, where scientists have found evidence of water ice, Cichan said. That wasn\u2019t possible with the Apollo-era landers, which were coming directly from Earth and were limited to landing sites along the moon's equator.\n\nIn addition to allowing more extensive exploration of the moon, the upcoming lunar missions would make it possible to test technologies and systems that one day could be used to take humans to Mars.\n\n\u201cBefore we send crews on a three-year round trip, we want to test out that capability while we\u2019re still relatively close to home,\u201d said Tony Antonelli, director of advanced programs at Lockheed Martin and a former NASA astronaut.\n\nLockheed Martin isn\u2019t the only company with its sights set on the moon. Last week, Jeff Bezos\u2019 aerospace company, Blue Origin, announced that it is designing a reusable lunar lander of its own. Blue Origin said its lander is part of the company\u2019s goal of expanding civilization beyond the confines of Earth, with millions of people eventually living and working in space.\n\nWant more stories about human spaceflight?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.",

  "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/donald-trump-s-tax-returns-could-be-his-greatest-vulnerability-ncna918386",
  "text": "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump wasted no time celebrating the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Indeed, Trump took a very public victory lap on Monday with his primetime, ceremonial swearing in of Kavanaugh in front of a sea of very pleased conservative dignitaries. But with Kavanaugh on the bench, some of the stories that were momentarily buried during the confirmation chaos are bubbling back to the surface.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 bombshell report exposing what appears to be massive fraud perpetrated by the Trump family is one of these stories. According to the Times, Trump\u2019s father Fred spearheaded a complicated con using \u201cdubious tax schemes\u201d and \u201cinstances of outright fraud\u201d to evade hundreds-of-millions of dollars in tax payments to the IRS.\n\nCheating on your taxes may not seem sexy, but this scandal may very well represent Trump\u2019s greatest vulnerability should Democrats retake control of Congress in November. Even if Democrats just take back control of the House, which seems more and more likely, that would first and foremost give them control of the gavel of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nOversight committee chairs have the power to issue subpoenas for Trump\u2019s tax returns and the financial records of the Trump business empire. Remember, this is an empire that continues to do business with the federal government, further enriching the Trump family despite grave concerns about conflicts on interest in the executive branch. Not surprisingly, so far, these conflicts have gone mostly unchecked by Republicans in Congress.\n\nAs a candidate, Donald Trump told Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d release his tax returns. He never did. The New York Times\u2019 reporting sheds light on the real reason why. Trump\u2019s entire identity is rooted in the myth he has repeated so frequently he may very well believe it, \u201cI built what I build myself.\u201d\n\nThe unraveling of that lie could even lead to the beginning of the end for Trump and his presidency.\n\nTo be clear, there is precedent for investigating the finances of politicians. And much of this precedent was established by Republicans. For years, Republicans pushed for a multitude of investigations examining the nexus between the Clinton Foundation and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump himself was part of this push going so far as calling for a special prosecutor to investigate if donors of the Clinton Foundation received special treatment from the State Department. This obsessive fixation with the Clinton\u2019s finances, coupled with her alleged misuse of a private email server, sparked the now infamous refrain, \u201clock her up.\u201d\n\nWhether or not the Clinton\u2019s deserved this scrutiny, there is no question that Trump\u2019s complicated financial network requires further inquiry.\n\nDuring my time serving as the spokesperson and senior advisor for the House Oversight Committee, we championed the belief that the American people had a fundamental \u201cright to know\u201d about any conflicts of interest that could jeopardize the integrity of the federal government. Trump has used his office to raise the visibility of his business enterprises while profiting from it. Government employees are staying at Trump properties and government agencies are renting spaces in Trump-owned buildings.\n\nThink about the implications of a president of the United States who is secretly in debt to foreign governments or even private individuals.\n\nBut what the Times\u2019 reporting suggests is that Trump\u2019s hotels are just the tip of a very large and very fraudulent iceberg. We still do know much about Trump\u2019s finances. We do not know if he owes anybody money. We do not know the terms of his existing debts. We do not know if the shady tax evasion schemes allegedly started by Fred Trump continue or how they may have impacted his son's current empire.\n\nThink about the implications of a president of the United States who is secretly in debt to foreign governments or even just to private individuals. Imagine what influence those entities or persons could potentially wield over the commander-in-chief.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is no stranger to investigations involving complicated financial relationships or the IRS. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Republicans on the Committee probed institutions like AIG, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and even the mortgages that members of Congress received. They spent years investigating the inner workings of the IRS in the so-called \u201ctargeting scandal.\u201d\n\nOf course, a sitting president has never had his tax returns subpoenaed by a committee because for the past several decades it has been customary for major presidential candidates to release them voluntarily. (Some experts believe Robert Mueller already has Trump's tax returns.) But that doesn't mean that the new chairs of the House Oversight Committee or the House Financial Services Committee won't try if Democrats take over. In other words, we may be just one Congressional subpoena to the IRS away from finally finding out the truth about this self-proclaimed \u201cself-made billionaire.\u201d",

  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nComing in to the 2018-19 season, the storylines were stacked against the NFL.\n\nProtests from players were fueling political debate. Concerns about concussions had many questioning the future of the sport. And people are tuning away from television and to streaming services.\n\nFive weeks in, the league and its media partners can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nTV ratings for NFL games have ticked up slightly in the first five games this season, adding 3 percent more viewers than in the same period last season, according to data from the measurement firm Nielsen. While it might sound meager, the increase is far better than the ratings of the past two years, in which the NFL endured a decline in total viewers of 9.7 percent for the 2017-18 regular season and an 8 percent drop for the 2016-17 regular season.\n\n\"The NFL is having a good year \u2014 relative to last year and certainly relative to the TV environment as a whole,\" said Robert Seidman, founder of the website Sports TV Ratings. \"But what will happen with the TV environment \u2014 that remains to be seen.\"\n\nThe ratings are a bit of good news for a TV industry that continues to deal with dwindling viewers, particularly in younger demographics. The NFL has not been immune to that trend, with viewership in the first five weeks down 5 percent among adults aged 18-34.\n\n\u201cEverything in television is threatened in ratings because people have so many other choices, and that includes the NFL,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a professor of television and pop culture at Syracuse University. \u201cBut in the end, I think the NFL is actually surprisingly stable given all of those other changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSunday Night Football\u2019s\u201d ratings from the Houston Texans-Dallas Cowboys game jumped up 17 percent from last year\u2019s telecast. Kevin Jairaj / USA TODAY Sports - Reuters\n\nThe league has been helped so far this season by close games and an infusion of young talent, according to TV executives who spoke to SportsBusiness Daily. Even the hard-luck Cleveland Browns have been surprisingly competitive, with an exciting new quarterback generating some buzz.\n\nBefore the season began, the NFL's most vocal critic, President Donald Trump, renewed his attacks on protesting players and the league, leading to worries that viewers may take the president's words to heart and stop watching.\n\nAfter the first game, the president tweeted about low ratings and concluded: \u201cIf players stood proudly for our Flag and Anthem, and it is all shown on broadcast, maybe ratings could come back?

  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With health care a top issue in the midterms, President Donald Trump penned an opinion article defending his administration's actions and critiquing single-payer \"Medicare for All\" proposals favored by some Democrats that would provide coverage to every American.\n\nBut the column, published Wednesday in USA Today, included a number of false and misleading claims, both about the Democratic plans and the White House's own policy. Others are accurate, but missing key context. Here's how the president's words measure up with experts, independent analyses, government reports, and his own actions.\n\nPre-existing conditions\n\nThe claim: \"As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums. I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.\"\n\nThe facts: This is false. The White House is actively trying to scale back current protections for pre-existing conditions in significant ways.\n\nIn the most drastic move, the Trump administration is backing a Republican-led lawsuit that argues Obamacare's protections for pre-existing conditions are illegal. If successful, insurers would again be allowed to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nThroughout 2017, the White House sought to pass legislation to partially repeal Obamacare that would affect costs and access for patients with pre-existing conditions. The American Health Care Act, for example, which passed the House last year, would have allowed states to scale back \"essential health benefits\" that insurers are currently required to cover. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted this would make premiums unaffordable for many people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe \"new health care insurance options\" that the president mentions include short-term health care plans that reduce premiums by denying care for pre-existing conditions. While they could lower costs for healthier patients, they're much less comprehensive and experts say they raise premiums for plans that do cover pre-existing conditions.\n\nLower premiums\n\nThe claim: \u201cWe are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.\u201d\n\nThe facts: While the picture for individual insurance plans is looking better in 2019 than 2018, the claim is misleading.\n\nThe administration has taken a variety of steps that independent analysts, including the CBO, say have raised premiums on individual insurance plans by a significant amount. While premiums for individual plans are looking more stable in 2019, experts say this is in large part because insurers already spiked their premiums last year.\n\nRelevant changes include ending requirements to buy insurance, cutting off cost-sharing payments to insurers that pay for lower deductibles, and expanding the use of less-generous plans that compete with more comprehensive ones. It's likely premiums would be coming down further now absent those decisions.\n\n\u201cHaving spent a good chunk of the spring and summer reading insurance company rate filings, my sense is that many insurers raised prices last year in anticipation of many of the current changes,\" Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, told NBC News.\n\nCost of Medicare for All\n\nThe claim: \u201c[Medicare for All]...would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.\"\n\nThe facts: This is accurate, according to an analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All bill conducted by the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center. A separate analysis by the center-left Urban Institute of an earlier Sanders proposal produced a similar figure, albeit with some different assumptions and a different timeframe.\n\nSingle-payer backers say the $32 trillion number isn\u2019t the full story, though. The new federal spending would replace all existing premiums and deductibles for everyone in the country. The individual gains would vary, though, since the expansion would require a major increase in taxes.\n\nThere's also a debate over how much the costs would be relative to the current system. The same Mercatus Center story found that total health care spending \u2014 private and public \u2014 would dip by $2 trillion in one scenario if the bill became law.\n\nSupporters of single-payer seized on that figure to bolster their claims that Medicare for All would save money by reducing administrative overhead and reining in costs for drugs, hospital visits, and medical procedures, which are much higher in America than other developed countries. But the authors of the Mercatus Center study say these savings rely on assumptions that they don\u2019t think are likely to hold up.\n\nPast Medicare cuts\n\nThe claim: \"Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.\"\n\nThe facts: The $800 billion figure is roughly accurate, according to CBO: The Affordable Care Act reduced spending on Medicare Advantage, a program that allows seniors to access privately-managed plans.\n\nThe \"harmed seniors\" aspect is another story. The savings come from reduced payments to medical providers and there's little sign seniors noticed much difference: Enrollment in Medicare Advantage has grown since then and premiums have declined in recent years. The ACA also expanded drug benefits for seniors.\n\nNearly 10 years after the ACA passed, it's hard to tie these changes to Democrats alone. Republicans incorporated the same savings into their own budgets and did not seek to undo them in last year's repeal bills. The Trump administration has since proposed further reductions in Medicare provider payments in their budget. While the president distinguished himself from other Republicans by not pursuing further cuts or a privatization plan, many Republicans in Congress and the administration argue they are necessary to reduce long-term debt.\n\nHow seniors would fare under Medicare for All\n\nThe claim: \"[Medicare for All] would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives. ... The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised.\"\n\nThe facts: Far from scaling back Medicare benefits for seniors, the leading single-payer bills would significantly expand them by eliminating premiums, deductibles and other cost-sharing and adding more benefits, like dental and vision coverage.\n\n\u201cIt's a horrible mischaracterization of what these proposals are,\u201d Linda Blumberg, an Urban Institute fellow who co-authored the think tank's analysis of the Sanders plan, said of the op-ed. \u201cReasonable people can differ as to whether [single-payer] is a good idea, but what he's doing is characterizing it as taking benefits away, particularly from the elderly. These proposals would actually provide broader benefits.\u201d\n\nIn his column, Trump argues that these benefits are illusory, because they would cause \u201cmassive rationing\u201d and doctors to turn away patients or go out of business entirely.\n\nBlumberg took issue with the president's sweeping language. It's unlikely doctors, beyond a limited number who cater to very wealthy clients, would stop accepting Medicare given that the new plan would be the only game in town. Nor is it the case that any expansion in care means less for others.\n\nBut the president is alluding to some legitimate concerns: Blumberg and other experts say the provider payments in Sanders' single-payer plan are unrealistically low. The government could keep them higher in order to make sure they can attract enough doctors and specialists, but that would also raise cost estimates for their plan.\n\nPrivate insurance\n\nThe claim: \"Next, the Democrats would eliminate every American\u2019s private and employer-based health plan.\"\n\nThe facts: It's true that single-payer legislation would end private employer-based insurance, but it would also replace it with a more generous version of Medicare that covers all Americans. Supporters argue customers would prefer the more comprehensive government plan, while critics say the disruption would be too jarring and the costs would be too high.\n\nAs the president goes on to mention, however, single-payer Medicare for All is still not a consensus plan in the party. Competing \"Medicare for All\" proposals by prominent Democrats are less sweeping and would only offer a public insurance option alongside existing private ones.\n\nSocialism\n\nThe claim: \"The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela.\"\n\nThe facts: This misleading claim implies that Venezuela, an economically struggling and oppressive far-left government, is the model for the health care plans under discussion, among other policies.\n\nYou'd be hard pressed to find a Democrat who cites Venezuela as a model, but plenty cite Medicare itself, which is already an example of socialized medicine. Nor are single-payer or other universal coverage plans unique to radical regimes. Far from it, they're the norm in the developed world, while the United States is considered the outlier.\n\nBut you don't have to trust the experts alone: Trump himself has repeatedly praised health care plans in places like Australia, Scotland, and Canada in recent years and even backed a single-payer plan himself in 2000 before moving toward more conventional Republican policies.\n\n\u201cOpen borders\u201d\n\nThe claim: \u201cIndeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe facts: This is mixing two claims, one about enforcement and one about health care. Both require some more context.\n\nA small, but growing, number of Democrats have adopted the activist slogan \u201cAbolish ICE,\u201d which refers not to the border patrol, but the agency created in 2002 to police immigration in the interior of the country. There's still no clear consensus what \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d means in practice, it's some Democrats have pushed back on the idea it's an \"end\" to enforcement. Often it refers to reorganizing agencies to focus resources on criminal investigations, like human trafficking, instead of less severe immigration violations. Critics on the right say this would nonetheless encourage more illegal immigration.\n\nFor the most part, Democrats have backed plans that pair a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants with more immigration enforcement. As recently as 2013, Senate Democrats unanimously backed a bipartisan bill that would address undocumented residents, but also double the size of the border patrol, build more border fencing, and institute new requirements for employers to check the status of workers.\n\nThe second claim implies that undocumented immigrants would have access to health benefits. This is still undetermined, but not out of the question. The leading single-payer bills in the House and Senate do not specify whether undocumented residents could claim coverage, instead leaving it up to the executive branch.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. would \"get to the bottom of\" the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as some Hill lawmakers pointed fingers at the Saudi government and vowed congressional action.\n\nKhashoggi was last seen visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a week ago. Turkish officials believe the journalist, a critic of Saudi Arabia's government, was killed during that visit.\n\n\u201cIt's a very sad situation. It's a very bad situation. And we want to get to the bottom of it,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nAsked if the U.S. would hold the Saudi government responsible for Khashoggi's fate, Trump said he would first \"have to find out who did it.\" He said he \"would rather not say\" whether he had spoken to the Saudis about the situation, though he added that \"the answer is yes.\"\n\nTrump's comments came as several Hill lawmakers took a tough line on the disappearance.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., warned of \u201chell to pay\u201d if Khashoggi had been murdered by the Saudi government, adding that \u201ccontempt will be met with contempt.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told NBC News that he had spoken with the Saudi ambassador and that it \"was not a great conversation,\" describing the Saudi relationship with Congress as \"probably the lowest point it's been since I've been here ... an all-time low.\" He added that he and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., planned to unveil bipartisan action Wednesday that would not require presidential approval or formal legislation.\n\nThe White House confirmed Wednesday that national security adviser John Bolton and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is Trump's son-in-law, had spoken with the Saudi leader, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, about Khashoggi, as had Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Kushner reportedly has a close relationship with the crown prince.\n\n\"In both calls, they asked for more details and for the Saudi government to be transparent in the investigation process,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"We will continue to monitor this situation and provide updates as available.\u201d",

  "text": "In a recent television appearance on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\" Abrams called Kemp \"a remarkable architect of voter suppression.\" That's become a rallying cry for Democrats in the governor's race, which recent public polling shows in a statistical dead heat.\n\nKemp, meanwhile, says Abrams and allied liberal activists are twisting his record of guarding Georgia elections against voter fraud.\n\nHis campaign spokesman Ryan Mahoney said in a statement that because of Kemp, \"it has never been easier to vote in our state\" and pointed to a new online voter registration system and a student engagement program implemented under his tenure.\n\n\"Kemp is fighting to protect the integrity of our elections and ensure that only legal citizens cast a ballot,\" Mahoney said.\n\nTwo main policies overseen by Kemp have drawn criticism and legal challenges: Georgia's \"exact match\" registration verification process and the mass cancellation of inactive voter registrations.\n\nAccording to records obtained from Kemp's office through a public records request, Appling-Nunez's application \u2014like many of the 53,000 registrations on hold with Kemp's office \u2014 was flagged because it ran afoul of the state's \"exact match\" verification process.\n\nUnder the policy, information on voter applications must precisely match information on file with the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. Election officials can place non-matching applications on hold.\n\nAn application could be held because of an entry error or a dropped hyphen in a last name, for example.\n\nAppling-Nunez says she never saw any notice from Kemp's office indicating a problem with her application.\n\nAn analysis of the records obtained by The Associated Press reveals racial disparity in the process. Georgia's population is approximately 32 percent black, according to the U.S. Census, but the list of voter registrations on hold with Kemp's office is nearly 70 percent black.\n\nKemp's office blamed that disparity on the New Georgia Project, a voter registration group founded by Abrams in 2013.\n\nKemp accuses the organization of being sloppy in registering voters, and says they submitted inadequate forms for a batch of applicants that was predominantly black. His office has said the New Georgia Project used primarily paper forms and \"did not adequately train canvassers to ensure legible, complete forms ....\"\n\nHis office says \"the law applies equally across all demographics,\" but these numbers became skewed by \"the higher usage of one method of registration among one particular demographic group.\"\n\nVoters whose applications are frozen in \"pending\" status have 26 months to fix any issues before their application is canceled, and can still cast a provisional ballot.\n\nBut critics say the system has a high error rate and decry the racial disparity that it produces.\n\n\"We've shown that this process disproportionately prevents minority applicants from getting on the voter registration rolls,\" Julie Houk, special counsel for the Washington based Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in an interview. With that in mind, she called it \"kind of astounding\" that Georgia legislators wrote it into state law in 2017.\n\nHouk's group wrote to Kemp in July threatening legal action if \"exact match\" wasn't ended.\n\nKemp's aggressive maintenance of the voter list has also garnered the threat of legal action.\n\nHis office says that they simply \"conduct regular list maintenance of the voter rolls to ensure election integrity\" as required by federal and state law. \"All of the affected records were inactive as a result of returned mail, National Change of Address, and 'no contact' list maintenance procedures,\" it said.\n\nKemp dismissed and derided the legal threat targeting the \"exact match\" policy, issuing a statement saying that with Election Day coming up, \"it's high time for another frivolous lawsuit from liberal activist groups.\"\n\nHis office said that since January 2014, elections officials have processed over 6.4 million voter registrations and less than 1 percent remain in pending status.\n\nState Rep. Barry Fleming, who authored the state law enabling \"exact match,\" said in a statement that it's authorized under federal law, and courts have upheld a similar law in Florida.\n\nBut Appling-Nunez said it's important for every Georgian's vote, including hers, to be counted in November.\n\n\"If you don't like what's happening you either have to vote to change it or get out there and change it yourself,\" she said. \"A life of politics is not for me so I have to support those who are fighting the good fight.\"",

And Wednesday, videotape was released of former Attorney General Eric Holder telling a Democratic audience at a campaign rally in Georgia on Sunday that they should \u201ckick\u201d Republicans when they perceive them as \u201cgoing low.\u201d\n\nDespite the continued reports of politically motivated threats or violence, Democratic Party leaders have worked to keep this anger burning and incite even more harassment and violence.\n\nBeginning with my own near-death experience at the hands of a deranged shooter who sought to assassinate a baseball field of Republicans, there is a growing list of violent or threatening actions taken against conservatives by Democrats.\n\nAshley Kavanaugh, Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s wife and his daughters received multiple credible threats.\n\nDana Loesch, NRA spokeswoman, received death threats against her children on Twitter.\n\nRep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., received such a threatening phone call that the man has now been indicted.\n\nJamie Gardner, wife of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., wife, received a text of a beheading after the vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nSeveral Republican Senators had their personal information, including home addresses, posted to Wikipedia for threatening purposes by a Democrat House staffer.\n\nCongressman Clay Higgins (R-La.) received threatening phone calls that led to a man\u2019s arrest.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Kent., and his wife Kelly Paul have both received credible threats that have led to arrests.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and his wife, as well as White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, were chased out of restaurants.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted by protesters and harassed out of a DC restaurant.\n\nRudy Peters, a Republican California Congressional candidate, was nearly stabbed while campaigning.\n\nMy office has continued to receive threats against my life that have led to arrests.\n\nA female pro-life activist was violently assaulted by a man that has now been found guilty of eight counts of assault for this and similar incidents.\n\nAnd this list goes on. The threats and the violence have not let up and instead of seeing my Democrat colleagues calling for an end, there have been calls for their supporters to keep going, to do even more to threaten Republicans.\n\nIn America, we win battles at the ballot box, not through mob rule or intimidation.\n\nAs a survivor of a politically motivated attack, it is tragic to think this is an acceptable state of political discourse in our country. I refuse to stand for this and I will continue to call for an end to it. A healthy, strong democracy is not possible if anyone lives in fear of expressing their views.\n\nIf this is going to stop, it must start with Democratic leaders, who need to condemn, rather than promote these dangerous calls to action.\n\nIn America, we win battles at the ballot box, not through mob rule or intimidation. While it\u2019s clear many Democrats refuse to accept the election of President Trump, if they want change, they need to convince people with their ideas and actually win elections, rather than call for violent resistance, harassment, and mob rule.\n\nAs I see, working in Congress every day, it\u2019s possible to agree without being disagreeable and address political differences in a civil manner. That\u2019s an example leaders need to continue to set.\n\nInstead, when Democratic leaders like Eric Holder call for violence, that is a direct threat to our democracy.\n\nI hope he and others think long and hard about the world they are creating and the impact they are leaving on this country.\n\nAs the oldest democracy, our country has long been heralded as the freest country in the world. It doesn\u2019t feel so free if anyone lives in fear for holding or expressing a differing opinion.\n\nLet\u2019s end this violence and return to civility before someone else gets hurt.\n\nSteve Scalise represents Louisiana's first Congressional district and serves as the Republican majority whip. On June 14, 2017, he was shot by a deranged Bernie Sanders supporter while practicing with fellow Republicans for a Congressional baseball game. He nearly died, and underwent multiple surgeries before returning to the House on Sept. 28, 2017, to bipartisan applause.",

  "text": "President Trump, in an interview Thursday with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d rebuked Eric Holder for his call to \u201ckick\u201d Republicans and spurn civility, saying the Obama attorney general\u2019s comments were \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe better be careful what he\u2019s wishing for,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cThat\u2019s a disgusting statement for him to make.\u201d\n\nHolder was captured on video speaking Sunday at a campaign event for local Georgia Democratic candidates. In the clip, he rejected former first lady Michelle Obama's famous call for civility in politics \u2013 adopting a confrontational tone that\u2019s become increasingly fashionable amid the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation fight and other debates.\n\n\"It is time for us, as Democrats, to be as tough as they are, to be as dedicated as they are, to be as committed as they are,\" Holder told the crowd. \"Michelle always says -- I love her; she and my wife are like, really tight, which always scares me and Barack -- but Michelle always says, 'When they go low, we go high.' No. When they go low, we kick 'em.\"\n\nHis fiery remarks came after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN in an interview, \u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for.\"\n\nHolder is considered a potential 2020 presidential candidate and has said he will make a final decision on running early next year.\n\nRegarding that possibility, Trump said, \u201cI think the primaries would gobble him up.\u201d\n\nTrump has long been accused of contributing heavily to the coarsening of U.S. politics \u2013 with his personal insults lobbed during the 2016 campaign, his raucous rallies complete with \u201clock her up\u201d chants, and his unbridled Twitter attacks on those who criticize him.\n\nDuring the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview, though, he said his rallies are \u201ccalm and well-run.\u201d\n\nTrump also weighed in on an ongoing tussle between House Republicans and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who so far has balked at appearing before congressional committees to answer questions on reports he once suggested wearing a \u201cwire\u201d against the president and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. A few conservative lawmakers want to subpoena Rosenstein, who denies the reports \u2013 but when asked about the dispute, Trump stayed relatively neutral.\n\nHe said Thursday he\u2019s \u201ca little surprised\u201d Rosenstein wouldn\u2019t want to testify on the issue, given what Rosenstein told him in a recent meeting, but stressed that they get along well.\n\nIn the interview Thursday, Trump also was pressed anew over the mysterious and disturbing disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor who has not been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials say they believe Khashoggi was murdered in the building by an \"assassination squad\u201d \u2013 and The Washington Post reported that Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, previously ordered that Khashoggi be lured to that country from his home in the U.S. and detained.\n\nAs Saudi Arabia denies involvement, the deep suspicion has raised questions about the historically strong U.S.-Saudi alliance, with some U.S. lawmakers calling for consequences against the Kingdom.\n\nTrump said Thursday the situation is looking \u201cvery serious,\u201d but would not draw any conclusions at this stage. \u201cI have to find out what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump spoke to Fox News on the heels of another rally in Trump country, speaking Wednesday night to supporters in Erie, Pa., where he again blasted Democrats for their efforts to derail now-Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court bid. He called their actions a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and said he \u201cnever even thought\u201d about abandoning Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nIn the wake of Kavanaugh\u2019s narrow confirmation, Trump has swiftly returned to his trademark caustic tone \u2013 openly challenging accuser Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s recollection of events, after initially describing her as a \u201ccredible\u201d witness. Ford accused Kavanaugh of groping and trying to force himself on her at a high school party more than three decades ago, an incident Kavanaugh denied.\n\nTrump now sees a potential backlash brewing against Democrats, however, for their role in the chaotic confirmation process and has doubled down in efforts to condemn them, hoping it pays dividends at the midterm polls.\n\nHe has been increasingly visible on the campaign trail, holding near-daily rallies to whip up GOP support while boosting Republican candidates and assailing their Democratic rivals. He even published a rare op-ed Wednesday attacking Democrats for their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan \u2013 accusing the party of slipping into socialism. He warned the plan could hurt seniors, but sponsor Sen. Bernie Sanders said that wasn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cNow the president, who has a very difficult time telling the truth about anything, is lying about the Medicare for All proposal that I introduced, which poll after poll after shows has strong majority support among the American people,\u201d the Vermont senator said in a statement.\n\nAhead of a White House meeting Thursday with Kanye West and NFL great Jim Brown, Trump also stressed that he is picking up support in the African-American community, citing economic gains. And he backed calls from both icons for criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unfair right now. It\u2019s very unfair to African Americans, it\u2019s very unfair to everybody,\u201d he said Thursday. In a pointed response, he said when asked about Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 well-known resistance to prison reform, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t [support it], then he gets overruled by me. Because I make the decision, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.",

  "text": "Following the bitterly partisan, acrimonious confirmation battle over Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., warned in an interview on Tuesday that heated political rhetoric has the potential to turn deadly.\n\n\"I fear that there's going to be an assassination,\" Paul told a Kentucky radio show. \"I really worry that somebody is going to be killed, and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation ... they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence.\"\n\nPaul's comments came the same day former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton declared that Democrats \"cannot be civil\" with Republicans any longer.\n\nPaul's wife, Kelley, revealed in a Breitbart News interview on Friday that she sleeps with a \"loaded gun by my bed,\" has updated her home's security system and has \"deadbolts all around my house.\" Kelley also wrote an op-ed published by CNN in which she called on Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., to tone down his rhetoric; in June, Booker suggested his supporters \u201cget up in the face of congresspeople.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky senator reiterated his wife's criticism on Tuesday. \"When people like Cory Booker say get up in their face ... What he doesn't realize is that for every 1,000 persons who want to get up in your face, one of them is going to be unstable enough to commit violence,\" Paul said.\n\n\"I fear that there's going to be an assassination.\" \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nLast week, Paul was chased and verbally harassed by anti-Kavanaugh activists at Washington's Reagan National Airport. And last fall, Paul was attacked and beaten in his yard in Kentucky by his neighbor -- an episode that a Kentucky Democrat joked about earlier this year.\n\nPaul was attending the congressional baseball practice last summer when a gunman opened fire, hitting House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., in the hip and injuring two Capitol police officers and an aide. The episode was very nearly a \"massacre,\" lawmakers said.\n\n\"When I was at the ballfield and Steve Scalise was nearly killed, the guy shooting up the ballfield, and shooting I think five or six people, he was yelling, 'This is for health care,'\" Paul told host Leland Conway on Tuesday. \"When I was attacked in my yard and had six of my ribs broken, and pneumonia, lung contusion, all that -- these are people that are unstable, we don't want to encourage them.\"\n\nREPUBLICAN SENATOR RECEIVES GRAPHIC TEXT MESSAGE OF BEHEADING, SEES PERSONAL INFORMATION LEAKED AFTER 'YES' VOTE ON KAVANAUGH\n\nThe uncorroborated sexual assault accusations against Kavanaguh, Paul said, didn't justify keeping him off the Supreme Court, much less the partisan rancor surrounding his confirmation. (Paul, who was initially skeptical about Kavanaugh's constitutional views on privacy, ultimately became one of the 51 senators who supported his confirmation.)\n\n\"We don't want this to be the standard, that anyone can accuse anybody of anything,\" he continued. \"That would sort of be the standard they had in Venice in the 15th century, when people would put their complaints into the mouth of the lion .... And you'd put your complaint in, and people would lose their head over that.\"\n\nPaul then echoed President Trump's comments at a ceremonial swearing-in for Kavanaugh in the East Room on Monday evening, as well as dramatic remarks by Maine moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins last week. The president apologized to Kavanaugh \"on behalf of our nation\" and, before thanking Collins, emphasized that \"in our country, a man or a woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\"\n\n\"You are presumed to be innocent,\" Paul agreed. \"I just feel really sorry for Kavanaugh and his wife and his children for having to go through that.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters have been arrested by Capitol Police in the past three weeks, with some briefly staying in jail. Kavanaugh, his family, his accusers and lawmakers all received death threats.\n\nWATCH: MOB CHANTING 'WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS' ACCOSTS TED CRUZ, WIFE INSIDE D.C. RESTAURANT\n\nSTAFFERS AT RESTAURANT GET DEATH THREATS AFTER TED CRUZ, WIFE HARASSED INSIDE\n\nProtests outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the first day Kavanaugh publicly sat on the bench for oral arguments, were relatively sparse. On Saturday, when Kavanaugh was formally sworn in, demonstrators outside banged on the Supreme Court's doors and attempted to claw their way inside.\n\nAnd a teacher in Minnesota announced she had resigned this week after asking on Twitter, \"So whose gonna take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?\" Supreme Court justices receive protection from the Supreme Court Police and the U.S. Marshals Service while in Washington, D.C., although they must ordinarily request protection on domestic or international trips outside that metropolitan area.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Trump suggested some of the demonstraters in the nation's capital were paid to protest, and were angry primarily because \"they haven't gotten their checks.\" Some of the anti-Kavanaugh protesters who accosted senators on Capitol Hill have ties to liberal billionaire George Soros.\n\nA 27-year-old Democratic congressional intern was arrested last week and accused of posting the personal information of at least one Republican senator during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh. The intern, who has since been fired, was denied bail on Tuesday.\n\nAlso speaking in a radio interview on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he was proud of his Republican colleagues for standing up to what he called \"mob tactics\" during the Kavanaugh confirmation battle.\n\nMcConnell also said that he would have no problem appointing a conservative justice in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election if Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were to retire from the bench. He distinguished that hypothetical from the situation with failed Obama nominee Merrick Garland in 2016 because at that time, different parties controlled the White House and the Senate.\n\nWATCH: NANCY PELOSI COMPARES KAVANAUGH TO NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG UN\n\n\"It will depend largely if the Senate is in Republican hands or Democratic hands,\" McConnell said, saying it is exceedingly rare for a lame-duck president whose party does not control the Senate to nominate a Supreme Court justice.\n\n\"I think they overplayed their hand.\" \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\n\nThe GOP is currently favored to retain control of the Senate after November's midterm elections, buoyed in part by a newly energized base after the Kavanaugh fight.\n\nFOX NEWS POLLS SHOW MAJOR GOP BOOST IN KEY SENATE BATTLEGROUNDS WITH LESS THAN A MONTH BEFORE MIDTERMS\n\n\"This has been like a shot of adrenaline to Republican voters who probably were not as interested or energized in an off-year election with the president not on the ballot,\" McConnell said. \"I think they overplayed their hand. I think the tactics turned off people and turned on our base.\"",

  "text": "Speaking on Sunday at a campaign event for local Georgia Democratic candidates, former Attorney General Eric Holder flatly rejected former first lady Michelle Obama's widely cited call for civility and instead seemingly urged Democrats to brawl with Republicans.\n\n\"It is time for us, as Democrats, to be as tough as they are, to be as dedicated as they are, to be as committed as they are,\" Holder told a crowd of campaign volunteers and candidates. \"Michelle always says -- I love her; she and my wife are like, really tight, which always scares me and Barack -- but Michelle always says, 'When they go low, we go high.' No. When they go low, we kick 'em.\"\n\n\"When they go low, we kick 'em.\" \u2014 Former Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nWATCH: HOLDER TELLS GEORGIA CROWD TO 'KICK' REPUBLICANS\n\nAfter raucous applause, Holder, who served in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2015, added: \"That's what this new Democratic Party is about.\"\n\nHolder clarified later: \"When I say 'kick 'em,' I don't mean do anything inappropriate, don't do anything illegal. But we've got to be tough. And we've got to fight for the very things that John Lewis, Martin Luther King, Whitney Young, all those folks gave to us. That stuff can be taken away. That's what they want to do.\"\n\nMichelle Obama had used the conciliatory line \"When they go low, we go high\" in her address to the 2016 Democratic National Convention to draw a contrast to then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric.\n\nPresident Trump has sought to characterize mob tactics as a hallmark of modern progressivism, in the wake of comments by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., encouraging protesters to confront and \"push back on\" his Cabinet members in public places. Trump has mockingly called Waters a \"leader\" of the Democratic Party, even as he said her IQ hovers in the mid-60s.\n\nWATCH: TED CRUZ CHASED OUT OF RESTAURANTS BY ANTI-KAVANAUGH MOB CHANTING 'WE BELIEVE WOMEN'\n\nIn his off-the-cuff remarks Sunday, Holder criticized what he called Republican efforts to \"racially gerrymander\" districts in response to seeing \"people of color populat[ing] the suburbs of Atlanta. \"They have used the power they have gotten for all the wrong things. They want to keep themselves in power,\" he said.\n\nHolder concluded: \"We\u2019re proud as hell to be Democrats, we\u2019re willing to fight for the ideals of the Democratic Party. we\u2019re proud of our history, we\u2019re proud of our present, and we\u2019re proud of the future we can create for this country.

BECAUSE OF HATEFUL RHETORIC\n\nThe former attorney general is considered a potential 2020 presidential candidate, and he has said he will make a final decision on running early next year.\n\nHis fiery remarks came as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN in an interview Tuesday, \u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that\u2019s when civility can start again,\" Clinton told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \"But until then, the only thing Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.\u201d\n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., fiercely criticized Clinton's comments, saying the former presidential candidate was encouraging \"mob tactics.\"\n\n\"The Senate and the nation will not be intimidated.\" \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n\"The far-left mob is not letting up. Earlier today, former Secretary of State Clinton sent this signal as clear as day,\" McConnell said. \"She told CNN exactly how she views millions of Americans who hold different political views from her own.\"\n\nCOLBERT SHOW WRITER: 'I'M JUST GLAD WE RUINED BRETT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE'\n\n\"No peace until they get their way?\" McConnell continued, quoting Clinton's comments. \"More of these unhinged tactics? Apparently, this is the left's rallying cry. But fortunately, the American people know that the fact-free politics of hate, fear and intimidation are not how we actually govern in our democratic republic. ... The Senate and the nation will not be intimidated.\"\n\nFor her part, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News that Clinton's remarks \"dangerous.\" They came after video footage showed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tx., being chased out of a restaurant with his wife by anti-Kavanaugh protesters.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., warned in an interview on Tuesday that partisan rhetoric in D.C. -- which reached a heightened pitch in the wake of the confirmation of Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- has the potential to turn deadly soon.\n\n\"I fear that there's going to be an assassination,\" Paul told a Kentucky radio show. \"I really worry that somebody is going to be killed, and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation ... they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence.\"\n\nPaul's wife, Kelley, revealed in a Breitbart News interview on Friday that she sleeps with a \"loaded gun by my bed,\" has updated her home's security system and has \"deadbolts all around my house.\" Kelley also wrote an op-ed published by CNN in which she called on Sen.

  "text": "The stunning scope of Hurricane Michael's rampage started coming into focus Thursday, as dawn in Panama City, Florida revealed a sprawling mess of almost unimaginable devastation wrought by the third-most powerful hurricane in recorded history to lash the U.S. mainland.\n\nMichael is now a tropical storm and, as of Thursday morning, was pushing its way across South Carolina -- while also lashing North Carolina and Virginia with strong winds and heavy rains amid a tornado threat.\n\nHurricane Michael made landfall around 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, just north of Mexico Beach, as a Category 4 storm with 155 mph sustained winds -- just 1 mph below the threshold for a Category 5 designation. The storm blasted the Florida Panhandle and southwest Georgia with wicked winds and killed at least two people.\n\nIn Panama City, located just west of where the monster storm made landfall, drone video taken by storm chaser Brett Adair shows how the winds and rain ravaged a middle school.\n\nJinks Middle School took such a hit from the hurricane that Adair was able to fly the drone right through the school's gym, where Michael's fierce gusts peeled back the roof and collapsed walls. Not that everything was ripped apart: Even with debris lining the basketball court, a volleyball net remained taut and in place, awaiting the next match.\n\nAS HURRICANE MICHAEL HITS, FLORIDA MAN WRITES NAME ON ARM IN CASE HE DOESN'T SURVIVE STORM\n\nElsewhere in Panama City, downed power lines, uprooted trees and buildings with tops peeled open like soup cans littered the landscape. As of Thursday morning, more than 359,300 customers were without power in Florida.\n\nVance Beu, who was staying at an apartment complex with his mother, told the Associated Press the storm had \"super high-pitched\" and sounded like \"a jet engine was coming.\"\n\n\"It was terrifying, honestly. There was a lot of noise. We thought the windows were going to break at any time,\" he told the AP.\n\nHURRICANE MICHAEL'S HEALTH RISKS: 3 THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR\n\nRescue workers will spend Thursday going through the wreckage of homes in neighborhoods where people did not evacuate before Michael slammed the area. FEMA administrator Brock Long told \"FOX & friends\" on Thursday that crews were only able to do \"limited\" search and rescue operations before nightfall.\n\n\"We are worried about the damage once we see sunrise,\" he said.\n\nSo far, the storm's deaths have included a man in Florida killed by a fallen tree when it ripped through his home\u2019s roof and an 11-year-old girl in Georgia, who died, when a car or boat port went airborne onto the family's mobile home.\n\nRick Reichmuth, Fox News' chief meteorologist, said Michael was the fourth most powerful storm to ever make landfall in the U.S. regarding wind, and the third most powerful in terms of pressure, at 919 mb. It was the first storm of its magnitude to make landfall in the Panhandle since record-keeping began 1851.\n\nFox News' Stephen Sorace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The girl, whose identity has not been released, was hit by the structure as it tore through the home's roof.\n\nAuthorities told WMAZ-TV that first responders didn't reach the home until after nightfall due to downed trees and power lines blocking their way.\n\nSearch and rescue crews were expected to escalate efforts to reach hardest-hit areas and check for anyone trapped or injured in the storm debris.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott said crews were working on clearing roads so that first responders could reach those impacted by the storm.\n\nThe powerful storm made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon and ripped through the Florida Panhandle with 155 mph winds and 12-foot waves.\n\nRick Reichmuth, Fox News' chief meteorologist, said Michael was the fourth most powerful storm to ever make landfall in the U.S. in terms of wind, and the third most powerful in terms of pressure, at 919 mb. It was the first storm of its magnitude to make landfall in the Panhandle since record-keeping began 1851.\n\nAcross the Panhandle, roaring winds splintered trees and rooftops. Neighborhood streets flooded as waves battered the shoreline.\n\nDamage in Panama City was so extensive that broken and uprooted trees and downed power lines lay nearly everywhere. Roofs were peeled away, sent airborne, and homes were split open by fallen trees. Twisted street signs lay on the ground.\n\nMore than 380,000 homes and businesses in Florida were without power at the height of the storm.\n\nGeorgia Power said that nearly 300,000 customers have lost power as Michael sweeps across the state Thursday morning, WSB-TV reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael continues its track across central and eastern Georgia toward the Carolinas, still reeling from flooding by last month's Hurricane Florence.\n\nThe storm, which has sustained winds of 50 mph, was about 30 miles west of Augusta, Ga., and 90 miles northeast of Macon, the National Hurricane Center said in a 5 a.m. ET advisory.\n\nAccording to the agency, strong winds, heavy rain and tornadoes are expected across parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina through Thursday. Rainfall of 4-7 inches could inundate parts of Georgia, which could also see flash-flooding.\n\nAlthough the storm is steadily weakening, Tropical Storm Warnings remain in effect for southeastern Georgia and much of the Carolinas.\n\nMichael is forecast to move off the Mid-Atlantic coast by early Friday, the NHC said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

I thought there would be plenty of time for that to happen.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the couple said \"I do\" in a private ceremony at Walker's Point in Kennebunkport, Maine, in front of family, according to a statement from the office of her father, former President George W. Bush.\n\nPer People magazine, Barbara, 36, and the Los Angeles-based screenwriter knew they wanted to have their wedding in Maine after they spent some quality time there with her grandfather, his first visit without his wife, over the summer.\n\n\u201cIt was just us three \u2014 quiet and beautiful,\" Barbara said. \"I would read to him. While he napped, Craig and I would go on walks, then dress my grandfather up and take him out for martinis and oysters.\"\n\nAccording to a press release, both Barbara's grandfather and father escorted her down the aisle. Her aunt, Dorothy Bush Koch, officiated the ceremony.\n\nAs for her something borrowed? Barbara, who wore a custom ivory silk crepe Vera Wang gown, told People that it was a bracelet her grandfather gave her late grandmother on their 70th anniversary. Her something blue was a pair of earrings from her sister Jenna.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing about waiting,\u201d Barbara tells People. \u201cYou can have this great career and this great life. But, of course, the older you get, you lose people that you love.\u201d\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report.",

  "text": "Model and horse trainer Shannon Ihrke joined the United States Marine Corps 10 years ago \u2014 and even though she left active duty in 2012 to focus on her other passions, the blonde bombshell credits the armed forces with giving her life direction.\n\n\u201cI loved it. Absolutely loved it,\u201d Ihrke said in an exclusive interview with Fox News. \u201cWhen I joined, it was 2008 and I was unsure of where I wanted to go, directionwise. I was working two jobs and going to college at the same time, and I just did not know what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota native said her light-bulb moment for joining the armed forces was while working at one of her part-time jobs at a clothing store.\n\nFLORIDA COUPLE HONORS ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS WITH ANNUAL FISHING TOURNAMENT: 'WE WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE ROCK STARS'\n\n\u201cI was working two jobs to afford college, and my manager at the clothing store where I was working had a law degree. And I just thought \u2014 it was the recession \u2014 and I thought if she has a law degree and is working at a clothing store, there aren\u2019t going to be any jobs for me when I graduate college.\u201d\n\nConcerned about debt, Ihrke said she approached her college counselor to ask about funding.\n\n\u201c[The counselor] told me two people get college completely paid for \u2014 single moms and those in the military,\u201d Ihrke said.\n\n\u201cI thought, well \u2026 [the first one] is out,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut I thought about the military and so I went to a recruiting fair. The Marines were one of the first people I talked to.\u201d\n\nThough Ihrke said she does not come from a military background, she was intrigued by the armed forces. And after a recruiter from the Marines told her she would not last \u2014 claiming the Marines' boot camp was twice as hard as other branches \u2014 she knew she had to prove herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I was talking to the Marine Corps recruiters, they said, 'Ours is twice as hard. You probably [would not] make it through our boot camp anyway. A little girl like you wouldn\u2019t make it,'\u201d she recalled. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Where can I sign up?\u2019\u201d\n\nVETERAN KICKED OFF RIDE FOR NOT HAVING \u2018REAL LEGS\u2019 CALLS ON SIX FLAGS TO CHANGE POLICIES\n\nA week later, Ihrke was at boot camp pushing herself harder than ever \u2014 and loving it.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back I was just like, \u2018I loved boot camp.\u2019 I walked straight up to the recruiter and told him and he goes, \u2018Oh yeah, I knew you\u2019d be fine,\u2019\u201d Irhke said with a laugh. \u201cI was stunned, but he told me he knew I had an alpha personality, and would do well.\u201d\n\nIhrke, who was stationed in South Carolina, explains that once she got into the military, she loved it. And if it had not been for her desire to pursue other passions, she would have reenlisted.\n\nFORMERLY HOMELESS NAVY MOM AIMS TO WIN MAXIM COVER GIRL COMPETITION \u2013 AND GIVE BACK TO VETS, AT-RISK YOUTH\n\nDuring the final six months of her active duty, Ihrke said she started dabbling in modeling \u2014 getting clearance to leave some weekends for modeling shoots \u2014 which led her to Maxim.\n\n\u201cMaxim was having this contest called \u2018Hometown Hotties,\u2019 and I sent in my pictures,\u201d she said. \u201cI never thought I would win.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce [I made] the final 10, they flew me out to Vegas for another shoot. And when they found out I was military, they said they wanted to do another special shoot with me.\u201d\n\nTo her surprise, Ihrke said she didn\u2019t hear from Maxim again \u2026 only found out about landing the magazine cover after a friend called her at six in the morning.\n\n\u201cMy friend was at the airport and he called me and said, \u2018Congratulations on getting the Maxim cover.\u2019 And I was just stunned. I had no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was freaking out!\u201d Ihrke said, adding that she ran to the nearest bookstore and bought every copy it had.\n\nSince her cover, Ihrke has done runway, catalog and print modeling, and served as a spokesmodel for Chicago\u2019s radio station The Loop for five years. But even though Ihrke was enjoying modeling for various outlets, she still held the military close to her heart. So when photographer Thomas Prusso reached out to do a tactical-themed calendar shoot, she was all for it.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nIhrke said she flew out and participated in the calendar, which is available to order through her own social media channels.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun. I still love the Marine Corps and think it gave me a lot of direction and am glad that I did it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still involved in several military charities and work closely with the Chicago Marine Corps Foundation, which supports giving scholarships to kids that have dads or moms that were wounded or passed away in the military,\u201d she added.",

  "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-senator-heitkamp-slams-clinton-call-to-abandon-civility-with-gop",
  "text": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's incendiary suggestion this week that liberals \"cannot be civil\" with Republicans any longer is unproductive and simply \"ridiculous,\" a top Democratic senator said Wednesday.\n\nThe stark repudiation of Clinton's comments by Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., a vulnerable red-state Democrat seeking re-election this year, comes as Republicans have lined up in recent days to criticize Democrats' fiery rhetoric amid the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,\u201d Clinton told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that\u2019s when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.\u201d\n\nWATCH: ERIC HOLDER TELLS DEMS, 'WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK 'EM'\n\nHeitkamp, whose \"no\" vote on Kavanaugh seemingly caused her already-wavering popularity to plummet in North Dakota, minced no words in response Wednesday night.\n\n\"That's ridiculous,\" Heitkamp said on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" \"I mean, I can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics, and that goes for both sides.\"\n\n\"I hope that we can find common ground in this country that sexual assault is more prominent than people thought it was,\" Heitkamp continued.\n\nFox News' polling shows Republican challenger Kevin Cramer now leading Heitkamp by 12 points (53 percent to 41 percent). Last month, before Heitkamp voiced her reluctance to support Kavanaugh, he was up by only 4 points.\n\n\"That's ridiculous. ... I hope that we can find common ground.\" \u2014 Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.\n\n\u201cThat spectacle proved to be perhaps the greatest political gift I\u2019ve been given in a very long time,\u201d Cramer said. Heitkamp has said she was leaning toward voting for Kavanaugh until she re-watched his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month with the sound off, and analyzed his \"body language.\"\n\nPresident Trump enjoys a 64 percent approval rating in North Dakota, but part of the Democratic plan to keep Heitkamp\u2019s seat is to exploit uncertainty over agricultural tariffs favored by the White House. Republicans are looking to take the seat to expand their narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate.\n\nSenior Republican strategists and politicians lined up to echo Heitkamp's sentiment on civility this week, which could help her regain some standing among conservatives with less than a month before November's midterm elections.\n\nSpeaking on \"Fox & Friends,\" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway called Clinton's comments \"dangerous.\"\n\nOPINION: RNC CHAIRWOMAN ASKS IF ERIC HOLDER'S CALL TO 'KICK' REPUBLICANS IS LEFT'S NEW NORMAL\n\nProtests outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the first day Kavanaugh publicly sat on the bench for oral arguments, were relatively sparse. On Saturday, when Kavanaugh was formally sworn in, demonstrators outside banged on the Supreme Court's doors and attempted to claw their way inside.\n\nHundreds of protesters have been arrested by Capitol Police in the past three weeks, with some briefly staying in jail. Kavanaugh, his family, his accusers and lawmakers all received death threats.\n\nMeanwhile, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who last year was beaten in his yard and shot at while participating in a GOP congressional baseball practice, blamed Democrats for potentially inciting violence.\n\nWATCH: TED CRUZ, WIFE CHASED OUT OF D.C. RESTAURANT BY MOB CHANTING 'WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS'\n\n\"I fear that there's going to be an assassination,\" Paul told a Kentucky radio show on Tuesday. \"I really worry that somebody is going to be killed, and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation ... they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When I was at the ballfield and Steve Scalise was nearly killed, the guy shooting up the ballfield, and shooting I think five or six people, he was yelling, 'This is for health care.' ... When I was attacked in my yard and had six of my ribs broken, and pneumonia, lung contusion, all that -- these are people that are unstable, we don't want to encourage them.\"\n\nPaul specifically called out Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., for saying this summer that his supporters should \"get up in the face of some congresspeople.\" President Trump and other Republicans have also criticized Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., for urging protesters to harass Trump administration officials in public, with Trump calling Waters an unusually \"low IQ\" individual who represents the new face of the Democratic party.\n\nThere are signs that Republicans are being targeted with increasing frequency in recent days. Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., revealed to Fox News on Sunday that his wife had received a graphic text message with a video depicting a beheading, and that someone has publicly posted the names and addresses of his family members.\n\nBILL AND HILLARY CLINTON ANNOUNCE NEW BOOK TOUR -- CHECK OUT HOW HIGH THE TICKET PRICES ARE\n\nThe apparent intimidation efforts follow reports from Capitol Police that the Democratic congressional aide accused of publishing the private information (known as \"doxxing\") of at least three Republican lawmakers last month also allegedly threatened to leak senators\u2019 children's health information if a witness told anyone about his activities.\n\nJackson Cosko, who recently worked for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, was arrested for allegedly doxxing Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah, on Wikipedia -- with information such as their home addresses and phone numbers. Graham, Lee and Hatch's information was published in September.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.",

  "text": "Kevin Costner\u2019s series \u201cYellowstone\u201d has raised the ire of PETA after a whistleblower informed the animal rights organization that real cow carcasses were used, and possibly mutilated, for the purposes of shooting a scene.\n\nOn Wednesday, PETA published a statement along with very graphic photo reportedly from the set of \u201cYellowstone.\u201d The image shows a mutilated cow that accompanied reports that some of the dead cows on the set appear to have been hacked apart in their hindquarters and necks. Others were reportedly left out in the sun to rot and appear more bloated.\n\nHowever, Paramount Network, which runs the show, says it\u2019s working with PETA to clarify what it calls \u201cinaccurate claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cParamount Network takes animal safety very seriously and with utmost professionalism,\u201d Kurt Patat, Paramount Network SVP of communications told TheWrap. \u201cThe production has taken necessary precautions to provide for animal safety and their well-being on set. All animals are monitored on set by professional handlers. We have been in touch with PETA which presented us with inaccurate claims that we were able to correct including no cows were killed or mutilated for the scene in question.\u201d\n\nNeither representatives for Paramount Network nor Costner immediately responded to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nPETA, however, told the outlet that it stands by its accusations.\n\nWhile some may wonder why PETA, which advocates for ethical treatment of animals, would care about what happens to already-deceased cows, it argues that not only are they not sure how the cows were killed in the first place, but that the wellbeing of the crew of \u201cYellowstone\u201d was put at risk over this alleged practice when a simple prop or CGI animal would do.\n\n\u201cExposure to animal carcasses can cause disease transmission to humans and lead to contamination of the environment,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe slaughterhouse industry is a violent and cruel one, and to use the bodies of animals who were subjected to that cruelty for a TV stunt is not only disrespectful but also extremely wasteful,\u201d PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange continued. \u201cPETA is calling on Kevin Costner and the producers of Yellowstone to come clean about how and from where the animals were purchased, cut the gruesome scenes, and pledge to use only props and other cruelty-free alternatives in the future.\u201d\n\nIts whistleblower also alleged that the crew asked why real carcasses were being used in the shoot only to be shrugged off. Some reportedly complained that the stench of the bodies was sickening and very difficult to wash off of them.",

His identity was not released.\n\n\u201cHe witnessed the assault against the clerk,\u201d UPD Detective Ken Hansen said. \u201cAnd his response, because apparently after the assault the guy came after him, and so he shot the man in the chest.\u201d\n\nThe suspect, identified as Benjamin Scott Overall, 37, set off a panic alarm around 6 a.m. Oct. 4 inside a 7-Eleven store in Millcreek, a suburb of Salt Lake City, KJZZ-TV reported. A responding officer approached Overall, who then allegedly fled to a nearby Starbucks.\n\nOverall then allegedly attacked a female employee, the Salt Lake City Tribune reported. A police \"probable cause\" statement said he punched her, hit her in the head with a metal basket, and kicked her.\n\n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t get away from him, and he continued to strike her on her head, face, neck and shoulders,\u201d criminal charges stated.\n\nThe employee, Shelby Hamilton, 24, said she thought Overall was going to kill her.\n\n\u201cHe just came in the door and \u2026 hit me in the back of the head from behind,\u201d Hamilton told the Deseret News. \u201cI was the first one he saw.\u201d\n\nOverall then \u201caggressively approached\u201d a customer who happened to have a concealed weapons permit, according to the criminal charges.

So I was surprised, but also very grateful. I was very grateful that he was there. And I was glad it was somebody we see regularly so that hopefully, in the future, I can thank him.\u201d\n\nOverall was charged Tuesday with aggravated assault and criminal trespass, according to court records. He remained hospitalized through Wednesday, recovering from his gunshot wounds, KSL-TV reported.\n\nA police affidavit cited by KSL indicated that Overall attempted to go into a hotel room that was not his earlier this year. He was convicted of intoxication in Salt Lake Justice Court in May, according to court records.",

In the mid-1950s, President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked Congress to include the words \u201cunder God,\u201d amid the rise of communism.\n\nCook reportedly told no one of his idea to skip the Pledge of Allegiance.

  "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/crosby-stills-nash-is-no-more-graham-nash-says",
  "text": "Musician Graham Nash adamantly turned down the idea of his original group ever embarking on another tour.\n\n\u201cCrosby, Stills & Nash will never play another note together,\u201d Nash said.\n\nThe 76-year-old, who has recorded solo albums for decades, has been touring as a solo artist for the last two and a half years.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get on stage. I\u2019m a communicator. I\u2019m a musician. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done all my life,\u201d Nash told the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash was originally formed in Los Angeles in 1968. The band played together for decades with Canadian musician Neil Young sporadically filling in.\n\nTheir history was marked by infighting and fractious relationships. Nash, who often played the peacemaker, said the fighting had reached its course.\n\n\u201c[Y]ou can only do that for so long without anything coming back (around). And when things came back, I passed. I\u2019m too old to deal with bulls\u2014t anymore. If you want to make music, fantastic. If you want to go around and call people names and attack people\u2019s girlfriends, go right the (expletive) ahead.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Crosby had allegedly referred to Young\u2019s girlfriend (now wife), actress Daryl Hannah, as a \u201cpurely poisonous predator.\u201d He later apologized.\n\nAfter a holiday performance in Washington, D.C., in late 2015, CSN called it quits. A year before that performance, Young had said CSNY would never play together again.\n\nNash said the \u201ctopical\u201d and political songs that characterized the band\u2019s early material would never resonate with today\u2019s audiences. In the 1960s and 70s, he said, young people were united in their opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nThe individual members never lost their interest in politics, however.\n\nIn 2017, for example, David Crosby became embroiled in a Twitter feud with Trump supporter Ted Nugent.\n\n\u201cNugent is a brainless twit. ... I can out think him without even trying hard,\u201d Crosby wrote.\n\nIn 2016, Neil Young called on then-President Obama to step in and settle a dispute over an oil pipeline that was being built on an Indian reservation.\n\nAn inveterate liberal and native Brit, Nash derided President Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an American citizen for 40 years, but I think this great country deserves better than Donald Trump. He\u2019s doing harm to the environment, civil rights, women\u2019s issues. The Republicans will be saddled with his legacy for a long time.\u201d\n\nNash has often been forthcoming with his views on various topics. When promoting his solo album \"Wild Tales\" several years back, Nash talked about his 20-year use of cocaine, how his views were shaped in part by his father's time in jail when he was a kid, and the ups and downs of his relationships with his now former bandmates.\n\nNash is currently on tour with former Bruce Springsteen guitarist Shane Fontayne and organist Todd Caldwell \u2013 both of whom toured with CSN in the past.",

The investigation intensified after a theft last week in which surveillance video recorded the suspected burglar wearing a mask and armed with a rifle.\n\nAnthony Rauda, 42, was taken into custody. Authorities said they managed to track him down Wednesday by following \"fresh boot prints\" left behind in a remote part of the Malibu Canyon wilderness.\n\nDetectives noticed \"a male adult wearing black clothing walking quickly who resembled the suspect in the burglary.\"\n\nRauda was armed with a rifle at the time, authorities said. He was arrested after a \"few tense moments.\" The rifle will undergo ballistics testing.\n\nRouda, who has a criminal history of burglaries and weapons violations, was being held on a parole violation as investigators worked to determine if there should be additional charges, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities appeared to increase their efforts in the burglary investigation after surveillance video from one of the burglary scenes showed a suspect armed.\n\nTristan Beaudette, 35, of Irvine, was shot in the head before dawn June 22 as he slept in a tent at Malibu Creek State Park with his daughters, ages 2 and 4. He had taken his daughters camping while his wife studied for an exam.\n\nThe park has been closed since.\n\nRauda potentially could face murder charges if the investigation links him to Beaudette's death.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

  "text": "The potential use of civilian drones by terrorists and other criminal groups to carry out attacks poses a \u201csteadily escalating threat,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray warned a Senate panel Wednesday.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Wray said groups like the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, MS-13 and Mexican drug cartels have made efforts to use commercial drones as weapons, the Daily Caller reported.\n\n\u201cTerrorist groups could easily export their battlefield experiences to use weaponized\u201d drones, Wray said in written testimony.\n\nThe drones could be used for surveillance, or for chemical, biological and radiological attacks on large open-air venues or government facilities, the FBI said.\n\nWray said the risk has increased since August, when drones equipped with explosives were used in an assassination attempt against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nWray\u2019s testimony came days after President Trump signed legislation into law that gives the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI the ability disable or destroy drones that pose a threat to government facilities, Bloomberg News reported.\n\n\"The FBI assesses that, given their retail availability, lack of verified identification requirement to procure, general ease of use, and prior use overseas, (drones) will be used to facilitate an attack in the United States against a vulnerable target, such as a mass gathering.\"\n\nThe drone provision amounts to an unchecked grant of authority to the government, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, adding drones could be removed from the sky for \"nebulous security circumstances.\"\n\nWray noted the FBI foiled attempted drone attacks on the Pentagon and Capitol building. Rezwan Ferdaus planned to use three remote-controlled airplanes, each packed with five pounds of explosives and capable of flying 100 miles per hour, and crash them into the buildings using a GPS system.\n\nIn 2012, he was sentenced to 17 years in prison.\n\nCiting federal statistics, Sen. Ron Johnson, R- Wis., committee chairman, said earlier this year that the number of drone flights over sensitive areas has jumped from eight in 2013 to around 1,752 in 2016, Reuters said.\n\nThe drone market has rapidly expanded in recent years. In January, the Federal Aviation Administration said more than 1 million have been registered in the U.S.\n\nCompanies such as Amazon, FedEx Corp. and Uber have embraced the new technology as it looks to expand its delivery options.",

  "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/saudi-ruler-ordered-detention-of-missing-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-report-says",
  "text": "Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, ordered that Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi be lured to that country from his home in the U.S. and detained, the paper reported Wednesday evening.\n\nKhashoggi, 59, has not been seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials have said that they believe Khashoggi was murdered and dismembered inside the building by members of an elite \"assassination squad.\" Saudi officials say Khashoggi left through an alternate exit, but have offered no proof to support that contention.\n\nThe Post report cited U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan, as well as interviews with some of Khashoggi's friends. They claimed that senior Saudi officials had approached the journalist with offers of protection -- including a government job in at least one case -- if he would return to his native country. According to one friend, Khashoggi told him \"I don't trust them one bit\" after a conversation with one such official.\n\nSince Khashoggi's disappearance, the Trump administration has come under increasing pressure to press the Riyadh government for details about his whereabouts. Earlier Wednesday, a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators instructed Trump to order an investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance under legislation that authorizes the imposition of sanctions for perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, torture or other gross human rights violations.\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty clear to me that something very bad happened to this man,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum.\" \"If this happened, if they murdered this journalist who works for The Washington Post in a consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, that\u2019s a game-changer for me.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said national security adviser John Bolton and presidential senior adviser Jared Kushner spoke on Tuesday to the crown prince about Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo then had a follow-up call with the crown prince to reiterate the U.S. request for information and a thorough, transparent investigation. On Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Robert Palladino said that the U.S. had \"no advance knowledge\" of Khashoggi's disappearance.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Turkish media published surveillance footage of the men Ankara believes to have been part of the \"assassination squad.\" The silent video also showed one of two private Gulfstream jets that Turkish media said carried the Saudi group, who flew in and out of Istanbul the day Khashoggi disappeared.\n\nThe Sabah newspaper, which is close to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, published images of the group that were apparently taken at passport control at the airport. The state-run Anadolu news agency published the names and birth dates of all 15 Saudis.\n\nThe footage shows some of the Saudis leaving a hotel and Khashoggi entering the consulate, walking past a black Mercedes van with diplomatic plates parked adjacent to the entrance. An hour and 54 minutes later, according to the time stamp, a black Mercedes van drives about 1.2 miles to the consul's home, where it was parked in a garage.\n\nKhashoggi, a wealthy former government insider who had been living in the U.S. in self-imposed exile, had written a series of columns for the Post critical of Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince, who ascended to that position last year, has led a widely publicized drive to reform the conservative Sunni monarchy but has also presided over the arrests of activists and businessmen.\n\nKhashoggi had gone to the consulate in Istanbul to get paperwork he needed for his upcoming marriage while his Turkish fiancee waited outside. The Haberturk newspaper reported Wednesday that Khashoggi's family was not aware that he was in Turkey at the time of his disappearance and neither knew that he was engaged to be married nor that he intended to apply for a marriage license.\n\nFox News' Nicholas Kalman and Gillian Turner and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

  "text": "Rapper Kanye West meets with President Trump Thursday to discuss manufacturing jobs and job opportunities for former inmates. This is what black political leaders fear and why black elites now hate him. By working with the White House, West may successfully deliver opportunity to black communities that have been left behind.\n\nBlack pundits and media have already ripped into this meeting. On Don Lemon\u2019s CNN show , Democratic commentator Bakari Sellers pointed to Kanye as an example of \u201canti-intellectualism,\u201d while right-leaning commentator Tara Setmayer called him another \u201ctoken Negro of the Trump administration.\u201d A columnist for the black news site The Root panned the meeting as \u201cwhat is sure to be the lowest collection of IQs in a 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue room since George W. Bush cuddled with Millie, his puppy.\u201d\n\nCelebrities aren\u2019t pleased either. Beyonce and Jay-Z reportedly have severed all ties with Kanye and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, over Kanye\u2019s vocal support of President Trump and Kim\u2019s visits to the White House to discuss criminal justice reform. Comedian D.L. Hughley compared this meeting to that of a black slave and his white master.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that these influential black figures malign any kind of outreach to the Trump administration. Perhaps they fear what these two forces together might accomplish for the black community: greater economic success and recognition by black America that its allegiance to progressive politicians has outlived its usefulness.\n\nAlready nationwide, blacks have been gaining in the workforce. The national black unemployment rate stands at 6 percent \u2013 the second lowest monthly rate in recorded history, just behind May of this year.\n\nHowever, Chicago\u2019s uneven economic prosperity demonstrates why more needs to be done to boost opportunity for blacks where despair persists. West recently announced that he's moving back to his hometown of Chicago.\n\nIllinois had the nation\u2019s highest black unemployment rate in 2016. In the Chicago area in 2017, the black unemployment rate was 15 percent although the city\u2019s overall unemployment rate had fallen to 3.3 percent . Even worse, a third (37 percent) of 20-to-24 year-old black men in the city were out of work in 2016, compared to 9.3 percent for all men that age.\n\nHigh unemployment is especially concentrated in certain blacks areas \u2013 particularly the south and west sides of Chicago. But this was not always the case.\n\nThe South Side of Chicago was once home to the steel industry and other industrial plants. In its heyday from 1900 to 1970, blacks benefited from employment at mills, as well as jobs generated by a manufacturing-driven economy, from waitressing to construction.\n\nWhen major steel companies started to close in the early 1980s, economic blight followed and persists today.\n\nThe editorial board of the Chicago Tribune explained : \u201cManufacturers left long ago. There are few retail and restaurant jobs. All the economic activity is located miles away in the Loop and elsewhere in metropolitan Chicago. Too many young people have inadequate job training and \u2026 nothing to do.\u201d\n\nWest aptly recognizes that the return of manufacturing and skills training would provide real opportunity for the young black population in Chicago.\n\nPresident Trump is the right person to get it done. Domestic manufacturing is experiencing a resurgence as the economy has added more than 325,000 manufacturing jobs under this administration. Manufacturing optimism is at an all-time high thanks to tax cuts and tax reform.\n\nAt the same time, under Ivanka Trump\u2019s charge, the administration has made workforce development (from apprenticeships to retraining) a priority, leading big-name employers to commit to training 3.8 million workers over the next five years.\n\nDespite this sustained high level of optimism, manufacturers say the lack of skilled workers to fill an estimated 500,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs poses significant challenges to growing their businesses. This is where government, the private sector, and the education system can come together to help out-of-work people gain the skills they need to secure work and a better life.\n\nIf manufacturing returns to places like the South Side of Chicago, and the black workforce has access to the training necessary for those jobs, workers will be able to look forward to real careers. The economic prosperity that has eluded poor neighborhoods for over a generation can return.\n\nKanye West is not an economist, academic or community organizer. -- He has aligned with President Trump to create opportunity for left-behind black communities. This makes him unacceptable to the black patrician and celebrity class. But if he\u2019s successful, he will be a hero to those who just want a chance.",

What if history shows that justices appointed by Republican presidents tend to migrate leftward, toward the middle of the ideological spectrum? What if some Republican-appointed justices -- such as Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, and David Souter -- migrated across the ideological spectrum so far that they became pillars of the high court's abortion jurisprudence even though the presidents who appointed them publicly expected the opposite?\n\nWhat if the real business of judging is interpreting words in the Constitution and federal statutes?

What if this theory lets judges decide what those words mean today?\n\nWhat if the opposite theory of constitutional interpretation -- called \"originalism\" -- informs that the meanings of words in the Constitution and federal statutes were permanently fixed at the time of their enactment? What if this theory binds judges to well-grounded historical meanings of words and the values they express? What if there is no reconciliation between these two theories of constitutional interpretation? What if judges and justices must choose one or the other or variants of each?\n\nWhat if the Constitution proclaims itself to be the supreme law of the land? What if that means that all laws and presidential prerogatives that are contrary to the Constitution are unconstitutional and the courts before which those laws and prerogatives are challenged have a duty to declare them unconstitutional?\n\nWhat if judges and justices -- when confronted with laws they like that are clearly unconstitutional -- often find creative ways to uphold those laws? What if that is not what judges and justices are supposed to do but they do it anyway?\n\nWhat if the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits searches and seizures by the government without a search warrant issued by a judge and based on probable cause of a crime? What if that amendment also requires that all search warrants issued by judges specifically describe the place to be searched and the person or thing to be seized?\n\nWhat if the Supreme Court has consistently held that surveillance constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment? What if the British practice of spying on colonists was one of the forces that animated the Fourth Amendment?\n\nWhat if the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, the Patriot Act and their various amendments authorize federal courts to issue warrants that are not based on probable cause of a crime and authorize warrantless surveillance for intelligence-gathering purposes? What if the George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations have taken the extreme position that these laws permit warrantless surveillance on everyone in America, even those who are not suspected of wrongdoing?\n\nWhat if this warrantless surveillance has subjected every person in America to the loss of rights protected by the Fourth Amendment? What if the Supreme Court has characterized the principle of those rights as being among the highest-protected by civilized society -- namely, the right to be left alone?\n\nWhat if a young lawyer who helped to write the Patriot Act in 2001 and its amendments in 2005 and who advised President Bush that he could spy on all people all the time was rewarded for that work with a lifetime appointment to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.?\n\nWhat if this same lawyer, by now a federal appellate judge, was confronted with a case in which the feds had spied on Americans in blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment? What if this judge was publicly committed to originalism -- which informs that the Fourth Amendment prohibits all warrantless surveillance of people in America, no matter its purpose?\n\nWhat if this judge employed linguistic acrobatics in ruling on this conflict between domestic warrantless surveillance -- which he advised a former president was constitutional -- and the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment, which he knew bars government spying without warrants?\n\nWhat if this judge -- claiming a loyalty to originalism but nevertheless embracing its opposite, the concept of a \"living Constitution\" -- ruled that the feds can spy without warrants on anyone at any time, as long as they do so for intelligence-gathering and not law enforcement purposes?

What if the Patriot Act permits the sharing of intelligence data with law enforcement? What if in this judge's mind, every bit of data on your mobile device or computer -- financial, legal, medical, personal, professional, intimate -- is available for government surveillance on a whim and without a search warrant?\n\nWhat if that judge just joined the Supreme Court?

  "text": "Justice Brett Kavanaugh heard his first oral arguments at the Supreme Court Tuesday and was welcomed warmly by his colleagues. It was a nice moment of collegiality after weeks of chaos and the promise of even more. With only four weeks until the midterm elections, Republicans are exuding more confidence, while Democrats are banking on more chaos.\n\nDespite the catastrophic loss of the swing vote on the high court, they are hitting the anarchy accelerator. These people truly believe they can protest their way back into power. President Trump warned us about this when he said, \u201cThe Democrats have become too extreme. And they've become frankly too dangerous to govern. They have gone whacko. But if Democrats take control, they will try to reverse our amazing progress and plunge our country into gridlock, frankly into poverty, ultimately into chaos.\u201d\n\nThe chaos strain has now even infected what was once the Democratic establishment. For example, why hasn't Dianne Feinstein, who was once considered a more sober-minded liberal, condemned the tactics of harassment and intimidation used against her female colleagues in the halls of the U.S. Senate?\n\nMaybe it's because pro-woman Dianne Feinstein wants to keep the atmosphere red-hot, scarily so, to drive Democratic voter turnout. Just when you think they couldn't go lower, they do.\n\nAs one liberal commentator on MSNBC said, \u201cTrump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most. He has delivered racism for these people. He has delivered misogyny for these people and now he has delivered the Supreme Court for these people, which is something that they've been trying to get for a generation. They now have control over all three branches of government. We're going to see if this reign lasts for 30 days, or two years or a thousand-year Reich.\u201d\n\nReich? Nice. So, if you are not on board with the moral dictates of liberalism, the left will demonize you as a Nazi, plant false stories against you, trash your family, try to destroy your life. And of course, they'll try to get you fired.\n\nAnd when you are President Trump or Justice Kavanaugh \u2013 I love saying that \u2013 they can't beat you, so they'll threaten to impeach you. As one charter member of the Clinton war room, James Carville, said, \u201cTo the Democrats, Kavanaugh is worth a lot more alive than dead. This is not going to go away. They are not going to stop doing stories on Kavanaugh. If the Democrats win the House, they'll probably hold some kind of hearings on the fact that a lot of people think that he perjured himself during his confirmation hearings to the Court of Appeals.\u201d\n\nDead or alive? Wow.\n\nHow is any of this going to make Americans\u2019 lives better? What is the new platform, \"Vote for us and we'll spend the next few years torturing anyone who is even remotely associated with Trump?\" This thuggish, win-at-all-cost approach was on full display during the Kavanaugh battle.\n\n\u201cWhy do women have to bear their whole soul to you?\u201d one activist shouted at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\u201cDon't you wave your hand at me! I wave my hand at you!\u201d another group screamed at Sen. Orrin Hatch. \u201cWhen you grow up, I'll be glad to talk,\u201d Hatch replied.\n\n\u201cHow dare you talk to women that way! How dare you?\u201d they shouted back.\n\nAnd of course, there was the chanting: \u201cWe believe survivors! We believe survivors! We believe survivors!\u201d\n\nIt's fitting that the woman who was one of the architects of the politics of personal destruction, along with Carville, has no problem with any of that. As Hillary Clinton, herself said, \u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.\u201d\n\nIt's like a kid who says, \"Well, I'll start behaving, mommy, once I get the extra piece of candy.\" Unless the Democrats are in power, there can be no civility. Yet they are the agents of mayhem that we've endured for two years now. This is what they've been doing since election night. Hillary would rather see the country swallowed up by discord and anger than admit that Trump\u2019s policies are actually bearing fruit.\n\nIt is all about foisting a liberal construct on America. The tonality and the set of precepts about open borders, open markets, and maybe toss in gender fluidity for good measure \u2013 all of that has to be accepted - or else.\n\nWhat happened to the softer, kinder Hillary we heard from just two years ago? The one who said, \u201cWe need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility. How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.\u201d -- Oh, wasn't that a nice moment at the Al Smith dinner?\n\nWhat Hillary really meant to say was, 'I believe that unless our campaign goes down in flames, and unless our opponent fulfills his promises, in which case we will scorch the earth, civility be damned.'\n\nImagine what these folks will do to us if they regain power. When you're done shuddering, make sure you vote.\n\nAdapted from Laura Ingraham's monologue on \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Oct.9, 2018.",

  "text": "A Russian rocket carrying an American and a Russian to the International Space Station failed on launch Thursday, forcing the astronaut and cosmonaut to careen back to Earth in a dramatic emergency landing.\n\nU.S. astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin parachuted to the ground safely in their capsule after a booster on the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft failed, NASA and Russia\u2019s space agency said. They were met by rescue teams in remote Kazakhstan more than 200 miles from their launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.\n\nManned space launches have been suspended pending an investigation.\n\nRussia has released photos of the men smiling while undergoing a medical checkup at Dzhezkazgan airport in Kazakhstan. They were sitting on a couch in front of a television with plates of nuts before them.\n\nThe men, who will shortly be flown back to Baikonur, were described as being in good condition despite having been exposed to higher than usual gravity forces during their descent.\n\nIt was the first time that the Soyuz \u2014 the main workhorse of manned space flight today \u2014 had failed on a launch to the 20-year-old International Space Station. The spacecraft has been the sole means of bringing humans to the space station since the end of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, but commercial providers aiming for manned spaceflight are increasingly nipping at Russia\u2019s heels.\n\n\n\nThe Soyuz MS-10 space ship carrying a new crew to the International Space Station blasts off at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday. (Dmitri Lovetsky/AP)\n\n\u201cShortly after launch, there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \u201cHague and Ovchinin are out of the capsule and are reported to be in good condition.\u201d\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, put it more bluntly in his daily conference call with journalists: \u201cThank God everyone is alive.\u201d\n\nAfter the booster failed, Ovchinin and Hague were forced to make a ballistic descent, coming back to the ground at a sharper angle than normal and causing higher gravitational forces on their bodies. But soon after the landing, U.S. and Russian officials said that rescue forces were in contact with the astronaut and cosmonaut. \ufeff\n\nAfter their rescue, Hague and Ovchinin were set to be airlifted to a space flight training center outside of Moscow. \ufeff\n\nRussian space chief Dmitry Rogozin said he was forming a state commission to investigate what caused the failure.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov, who oversees space flight, promised to share all information from the investigation with the United States and said that manned space launches would be suspended until the end of the probe, according to Russian news agencies.\n\n[Russia suggests sabotage on the International Space Station]\n\nThe rare failed launch of the Soyuz rocket is the latest and most grave problem to beset U.S.-Russian cooperation in space. Last month, an oxygen leak was found in the International Space Station that Rogozin said was made deliberately. Its cause still hasn\u2019t been determined. Russian officials have also insisted on a bigger role in a U.S.-led plan to build a space station orbiting the moon.\n\nNevertheless, officials in both countries continue to refer to space flight as a rare example of U.S.-Russian cooperation continuing despite geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe we\u2019re going to get the right answer to what caused the hole on the International Space Station and that together we\u2019ll be able to continue our strong collaboration,\u201d Bridenstine said on a visit to Moscow this week, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do is we\u2019ve got to very dispassionately allow the investigation to go forward without speculation, without rumor, without innuendo, without conspiracy.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nSpace, nuclear, polar bears: Russia and the U.S. still agree on some things\n\nNASA talking to companies about taking over the International Space Station\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

  "text": "Minnesota state Rep. Duane Quam and his rival, Jamie Mahlberg, got through the first half-hour of Monday\u2019s debate without any unpleasantness, really without anything approximating drama.\n\nThe four-term Republican and his Democratic challenger passed the microphone back and forth in decorous, 30-second intervals. There were no insults or raised voices \u2014 not from the candidates or the handful of prospective voters seated in neat rows inside the Rochester Public Library.\n\nAnd then, just before the evening wrapped up, someone asked about inflation.\n\n\u201cWould you support putting an automatic increase on the general education formula to match the consumer price index rate of increase the previous year?\u201d came the question from the audience.\n\nDebate rules set by the League of Women Voters dictated that Quam answered this one first. An engineer who has served for eight years in the Minnesota House of Representatives, he delivered a dry and detailed argument against the general principle of education funding formulas, and handed the microphone to his opponent one last time before things got weird.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the systematic disinvestment in public education,\u201d Mahlberg, a psychology teacher who had never run for office before, told the audience. \u201cI think we can do better than that, and we can start doing better than that by simply making sure that formula increases over time.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and turned to her left, awaiting the next question.\n\nShe did not see that from her other side, Quam\u2019s hand was sliding low across the table toward her.\n\n\n\n(City of Rochester) (YouTube/City of Rochester)\n\nIt all happened in about a second.\n\nQuam\u2019s left hand passed over a notebook and behind Mahlberg\u2019s plastic drinking cup.\n\nIt made a little detour around her elbow and shot up toward the microphone she still held at chest level.\n\n\n\n(City of Rochester) (YouTube/City of Rochester)\n\nAnd then he yanked the mic straight up from Mahlberg\u2019s fist, like Excalibur from the Arthurian stone, and made it his again.\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n(City of Rochester) (YouTube/City of Rochester)\n\nA stir went through the audience. Mahlberg whipped her head around and stared at her empty hand. \u201cOh,\u201d said the moderator. \u201cI see a rebuttal is required.\u201d\n\nQuam was more pithy as he launched into his second effort to explain his opposition to inflation formulas. \u201cI want to fund success, not failure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe formula builds in funding failure.\u201d\n\nMahlberg listened to this in silence, like everyone else in the library.\n\n\u201cI was really just kind of in a state of shock,\u201d she later told The Washington Post. \u201cI just wanted to make sure I kept my composure.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t recall feeling any anger or embarrassment. \u201cJust disappointment,\u201d she said. \u201cHow would anyone feel being on the receiving end of that disrespectful behavior? Disappointment, for my current representative.\u201d\n\nWhen Quam finished speaking, he leaned across the table again and offered the microphone back. Mahlberg looked at it briefly but did not take it. When he continued to hold it out, she looked away from him.\n\nAn amplified clunk shot through the library a moment later. Mahlberg spun back around to see that Quam had just lobbed the microphone toward her. The moderator laughed nervously as Mahlberg regarded the device, laying inert behind her name placard.\n\nShe picked it up, eventually, and answered the next question. She passed it back to Quam, and he to her, and the debate concluded without further incident.\n\nMahlberg said she didn\u2019t speak to her opponent afterward. She was surprised to discover the next day that she and Quam had been converted from the city of Rochester\u2019s public video feed into GIFs and YouTube videos, symbols in a national debate over the behavior of men in power.\n\nThe kind of cool, calm, and collected demeanor we have come to know and respect from Duane Quam.\n\n\n\nDonate to @JamieForHouseMN \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/UwGYOxdsNv pic.twitter.com/uvv0OVtowM \u2014 Matt Wagenius (@mattwagenius) October 9, 2018\n\n\u201cThe physical embodiment of the cocky, white male legislator,\u201d one tweeter put it.\n\nQuam didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment from The Post, but apologized in a statement to a Rochester newspaper, the Post-Bulletin.\n\n\u201cI respect Jamie and my actions at last night\u2019s forum did not reflect that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, my nerves got the best of me with our timed responses and I was not as graceful as I should have been while we shared the microphone. My sincere apologies to Jamie and I look forward to continuing a positive campaign.\u201d\n\nMahlberg said she had never noticed any aggression from Quam before the debate and declined to speculate on what provoked him in that moment.\n\nAnd while some Democratic groups are now spreading the video and fundraising off it, the candidate said she has no plans to do so herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ultimately focused on my campaign,\u201d she told The Post as she headed in to teach her first class of the morning. \u201cWe have 27 days until the election.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018I wanted to stop her crying\u2019: The image of a migrant child that broke a photographer\u2019s heart\n\nA valedictorian went rogue in his final speech.

  "text": "There have been stories about passengers flying with cats and dogs and miniature horses.\n\nThe list also includes a peacock, a hamster, a duck wearing a diaper \u2014 and a defecating pig.\n\nNow comes news of a . . . flying squirrel.\n\nA passenger was removed from a Frontier Airlines flight late Tuesday when she attempted to fly with her \u201cemotional support\u201d squirrel and then refused to get off the plane when she was told no, according to the airline.\n\nA Frontier spokesman said in a statement that the passenger had alerted the airline that she would be bringing an emotional-support animal on the flight but did not mention it would be so . . . bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\n\n\u201cRodents, including squirrels, are not allowed on Frontier flights,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe passenger was advised of the policy and asked to deplane.\u201d\n\nWhen the passenger declined, others aboard Flight 1612, which was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland, were forced to deplane so that authorities could remove the woman from the aircraft.\n\nFun fact: Frontier Airlines features a variety of animals on the tails of its planes \u2014 including \u201cFoxy the Red Fox,\u201d \u201cRudy the Raccoon,\u201d \u201cJim Bob the Badger\u201d and even \u201cSammy the Squirrel.\u201d Sammy is featured on an Airbus A320-214; Flight 1612 was an Airbus A321 and, thus, would not have had the squirrel tail.\n\n[Can you really bring a peacock on a plane? Service and support animals, explained.]\n\nThe incident occurred Tuesday night at Orlando International Airport.\n\nThe Orlando Police Department said that the squirrel\u2019s owner had boarded the plane but that when airline personnel noticed she had a cage containing the little critter, they asked her to deplane. When she refused, authorities were called to escort her from the plane.\n\nAuthorities said that the passenger vacated the plane when officers arrived and that they \u201cdid not have to take any action.\u201d\n\nA video posted on Twitter shows a crowd gathered at Gate 15. The post read: \u201cI just want everyone to know that all passengers had to deplane my flight to cleveland because a woman brought a SQUIRREL ON THE PLANE.\u201d\n\nA subsequent video showed a woman being escorted through the airport in a wheelchair as others clapped and cheered.\n\nEarlier this month, Frontier announced a new policy on emotional-support and trained service animals that is set to go into effect Nov. 1. It allows cats and dogs as emotional-support animals and restricts trained service animals to cats, dogs and miniature horses.\n\nEmotional-support animals, or \u201ccomfort animals,\u201d are not the same thing as service animals or therapy animals, which are typically trained to assist people with emotional and physical disabilities.\n\nAs The Washington Post has reported, emotional-support animals are not covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act, meaning businesses are not required to accommodate them. Federal regulations do permit them on airplanes but give the airlines permission to turn away unusual animals.\n\nAccording to The Post\u2019s Karin Brulliard:\n\nThough the Americans With Disabilities Act defines service animals as trained dogs or miniature horses, airlines are bound by the more liberal Air Carrier Access Act of 1986, which allows free travel for \u201cany animal\u201d that is trained to assist a person with a disability or that provides emotional support. Airlines can require passengers with creatures in the second category to produce a letter from a physician or mental health professional, but the documents are easily forged or obtained from websites that provide cursory, questionnaire-style \u201cexams.\u201d The result, airline officials complain, has been a surge in poorly trained animals that has turned some flights into airborne menageries, with dogs blocking beverage carts, cats urinating on seats and ducks wandering the aisles. \u201cIt\u2019s created a real issue on our planes,\u201d said Taylor Garland, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, which applauded Delta\u2019s changes. Garland said one union member was asked to administer oxygen to a dog that, according to its owner, was having anxiety midflight. Others have been bitten. \u201cThe aircraft cabin is a unique space, and \u2026 we need to recognize the limitations that exist when you\u2019re flying in the air in a metal tube.\u201d\n\n\n\nA grounded squirrel runs with an acorn in Portland, Maine.

  "text": "If there had been a movie called \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Whale-Watching Excursion,\u201d it might have sounded like one family\u2019s recent boating trip in Puget Sound.\n\nIn a video that has circulated widely, a man behind the camera \u2014 let\u2019s refer to him as the dad, as others on board the boat did \u2014 tries to calm his increasingly panicked family members as three humpback whales surround their watercraft.\n\nIt was not an easy task.\n\nFirst, there was the utter terror evident in one woman\u2019s voice as she hyperventilated while a whale expelled a spray of water from its blowhole, inches away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start the motor! Do not start the motor!\u201d the dad shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re all right. We\u2019re all right. Calm down. Calm down!\u201d\n\nA second woman\u2019s voice soon joined the chorus of concern: \u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s going right under us, you guys! You guys!\u201d\n\nStill, the dad tried to reassure his family: \u201cIt\u2019s all right! It\u2019s okay!\u201d\n\nThe whales, he said, were simply checking them out and would leave shortly. They were not going to hurt them. They are intelligent animals, he assured them.\n\nPro-whale dad was quickly losing traction with his family, though. Someone in the background could be heard muttering: \u201cStupid whales.\u201d Another person, perhaps a younger child, began crying. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die!\u201d someone moaned.\n\nOne last time, the dad tried to spread equanimity.\n\n\"Look at this, you guys. You\u2019ll never see this again,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very intelligent. . . . Relax, relax, relax, seriously.\u201d\n\nIt was then that one of the whales rolled in the water \u2014 a display so majestic that it prompted the dad to utterly and completely lose his cool.\n\n\u201cLOOK AT THAT, HE\u2019S ROLLING!\u201d he said, gasping. \u201cOH, MY GOD, THIS IS AMAZING, YOU GUYS.\u201d\n\nThe whale sank into the water until it was out of view.\n\nThat was the last straw for the first woman, who could be heard calling 911 moments later \u2014 to report the cetaceans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m out in Puget Sound, and there\u2019s three gray whales underneath our boat, and I\u2019m afraid we might get flipped over,\u201d she could be heard telling the emergency dispatcher, misidentifying the humpbacks. \u201cI\u2019m really scared.\u201d\n\nBy then, the dad was officially outnumbered. One of his kids demanded that he start the boat: \u201cFaster, please! Drive away faster, please! Drive away faster!\u201d\n\nThe dad, still sighing in awe and recording video, began speeding away from the whales \u2014 and into Internet lore.\n\nFootage from the trip, posted Sept. 29, went viral this week, as such videos do. It attracted a fair amount of ridicule (\u201cI can\u2019t believe she actually called 911 on whales,\u201d was a common refrain) as well as scattered sympathy for the frightened boat passengers.\n\nMonica Pepe, a policy manager with the nonprofit group Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said she could understand the woman\u2019s panic to some degree.\n\n\u201cThe fear in her voice is very real,\u201d Pepe told The Washington Post. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s not used to encountering whales, I can understand that, because they are so massive \u2014 but they really are more like gentle giants.\u201d\n\nThe only part of the video that made her nervous, she said, was when she thought the family might start the boat motor with a whale directly beneath them.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do in that scenario is to stay in place and don\u2019t engage the engines, especially if you\u2019re in a boat with large propellers,\u201d Pepe said. \u201cThey could have very easily made contact with the whale, which then obviously cause injury for the whales.\u201d\n\nPepe said people going boating should be aware of regional whale-watching guidelines, which dictate how far away watercraft must remain from various marine life. Some species have higher levels of protections than others.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s whale protection program \u2014 \u201cSee a Spout . . . Watch Out!\u201d \u2014 advises boaters to respect whales' space, more for the whales' protection than for the humans'.\n\nIn the rare event that boaters find themselves having to move away from a whale, Pepe said, it\u2019s best to go at a \u201cslow and safe speed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are unpredictable, depending on what they\u2019re doing in that area,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing slow would help to avoid a dangerous or possibly dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAmerica\u2019s fattest bear has now been crowned\n\nNearly 150 beached whales die after mass stranding in Australia\n\n\u2018Fascinated and horrified\u2019 scientists watched as a killer whale drowned another orca\u2019s calf",

  "text": "During the 2004 Republican National Convention, Arnold Schwarzenegger stood at a lectern at Madison Square Garden in New York, speaking about what it means to him to be a Republican.\n\nThe then-California governor addressed \u201cmy fellow immigrants, my fellow Americans,\u201d and posed a question: \u201cHow do you know if you are a Republican?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you believe that government should be accountable to the people, not the people to the government, then you are a Republican,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cIf you believe that a person should be treated as an individual, not as a member of an interest group, then you are a Republican. If you believe that your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does, then you are a Republican.\u201d\n\nHe went on.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s another way you can tell you\u2019re a Republican,\u201d he said.\n\n\"You have faith in free enterprise, faith in the resourcefulness of the American people and faith in the U.S. economy. And to those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy, I say: Don\u2019t be economic girly men.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time that Schwarzenegger used the term \u201cgirly men\u201d to refer to political opponents, but now, more than a decade later, he says he regrets it.\n\n\n\nFormer California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at the first New Way California Summit in Los Angeles on March 21. (Damian Dovarganes/AP)\n\n\u201cAt the time it felt like the right thing to do. It was in my gut. I improvised it. I called them girly men because they weren\u2019t willing to take risks,\u201d he said in an interview published Wednesday in Men\u2019s Health magazine.\n\n\u201cThey were afraid of everything,\u201d he added. \u201cPoliticians in general want to do little things so there\u2019s no risk involved. But it was shortsighted. In the long term, it\u2019s better to not say that, because you want to work with them.\u201d\n\n[Opinion: I knew Gov. Schwarzenegger. Mr. Trump, you\u2019re no Gov. Schwarzenegger.]\n\nThe phrase \u201cgirly men\u201d had been previously used by the actor-turned-politician and also appeared in a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit in which comedians Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon played Schwarzenegger-like bodybuilders named Hans and Franz. In fact, before Schwarzenegger said it at the 2004 Republican National Convention, he used it at a political rally.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Schwarzenegger called Democrats \u201cgirly men\u201d and urged voters to \u201cterminate\u201d them on Election Day \u2014 prompting outrage from his opponents, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the definition of \u2018girly man\u2019 is. As opposed to his being a he-man?\u201d then-California State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton told the Times.\n\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s going to \u2018terminate\u2019 members in November?\u201d Fabian Nunez, the speaker of the California State Assembly at the time, told the newspaper. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he means by that. That\u2019s not funny anymore.\u201d\n\nIn his recent interview with Men\u2019s Health magazine, Schwarzenegger suggested his language had been counterproductive.\n\n\"When you can reach out across the aisle and work together, you can get much more accomplished, rather than \u2018girly men\u2019 . . . or \u2018it\u2019s my way or the highway,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nHeidi Heitkamp calls out Hillary Clinton for saying Democrats \u2018cannot be civil\u2019 with Republicans\n\n\u2018I\u2019m back\u2019: Arnold Schwarzenegger awake, in stable condition after heart surgery, spokesman says",

  "text": "\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) arrives before a vote to advance Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nHillary Clinton says Democrats cannot be civil with Republicans who want \u201cto destroy what you stand for, what you care about.\u201d And, she added in her interview with CNN, civility in the United States will begin only when the Democratic Party wins back control of Congress.\n\nBut at least one member of her own party disagrees.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a red-state Democrat who has billed herself as a moderate, told CNN. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you get anything done if you don\u2019t bring civility back into politics, and that goes for both sides.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp appears to have been distancing herself from the former presidential candidate whom she praised and endorsed in 2016. Heitkamp is facing a tough reelection bid in North Dakota, a state that President Trump won by 36 percentage points.\n\n[Heidi Heitkamp talks to North Dakotans about her no vote on Kavanaugh: \u2018I just hope I have the chance to explain why\u2019]\n\nIn March, Heitkamp took offense to Clinton\u2019s comments that were seen as disparaging of middle America, including North Dakota. Clinton said in India that she won \u201coptimistic, diverse, dynamic\u201d states, while Trump carried \u201call that red in the middle.\u201d A North Dakota radio host, who\u2019s also Heitkamp\u2019s brother, later asked the senator when she thinks Clinton will \u201cride off into the sunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot soon enough,\u201d Heitkamp responded.\n\nHeitkamp had previously spoken glowingly of Clinton, telling the Daily Beast in 2014 that she thought the former secretary of state would run for president and be an \u201cexcellent\u201d commander in chief.\n\nExclusive: @HillaryClinton tells me that President Trump\u2019s ceremonial swearing-in of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh last night was \u201ca political rally\u201d that \u201cfurther undermined the image and integrity of the court.\u201d pic.twitter.com/g8evcwGI45 \u2014 Christiane Amanpour (@camanpour) October 9, 2018\n\n\u201cI think she transcends gender. When people look at her, they don\u2019t see male or female. They see a very accomplished, qualified candidate. She\u2019s very collaborative, very open to a different way of looking at things, uber smart. She digs down and understands the issue,\u201d Heitkamp said.\n\nHeitkamp, who won North Dakota by a one-percentage-point margin \u2014 less than 3,000 votes \u2014 in 2012, is one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate. With less than a month left before the midterm elections, Heitkamp is defending her decision to vote against the Supreme Court nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh, citing sexual misconduct allegations and concerns over the judge\u2019s temperament, honesty and impartiality.\n\nBut Kavanaugh, who was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of groping her and pinning her down on a bed during a house party in Maryland in the 1980s, is widely supported in North Dakota. Some polls show Heitkamp trailing by double digits against Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who has sought to paint her as someone who chose party over the people she represents.\n\n[Heidi Heitkamp says she was ready to vote for Kavanaugh. Then she watched his body language.]\n\nSpeaking with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night, Heitkamp called for bipartisanship and, again, defended her position about believing people who have been sexually assaulted.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric on both sides needs to calm down . . . If all we do is point fingers, that\u2019s not going to serve any purpose for the victims of sexual assault in this country,\u201d Heitkamp said.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, has been striking a more partisan tone, blaming Republicans for the chaos that has engulfed American politics.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength. And you heard how the Republican members led by [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and the president really demeaned the confirmation process, insulted and attacked not only Dr. Ford, but women who are speaking out,\u201d Clinton told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour.\n\nRead more:\n\nKellyanne Conway unloads on Hillary Clinton, calls her \u2018graceless\u2019 and less popular than her husband\n\nSusan Collins calls donations to her future opponent a \u2018classic quid pro quo\u2019 to extort her\n\n\u2018Moral dry-rot\u2019: The only Supreme Court justice who divided the Senate more than Kavanaugh\n\nGrassley says he would not allow Supreme Court vacancy to be filled in 2020",

  "text": "At the beginning of the American Music Awards on Tuesday, host Tracee Ellis Ross had some exciting news to share about Taylor Swift: \u201cIf she wins three awards tonight, she will become the most decorated female artist in American Music Awards history.\u201d Guess what happened next?\n\nIndeed, the fan-voted AMAs are the kind of show where if you see a superstar sitting in the audience, you can bet they\u2019re going to get a trophy. Such was the case with Swift, who won four awards, tying Camila Cabello for the most of any artist of the night. That means Swift now has 23 AMAs over her career; Whitney Houston previously held the record with 21.\n\nAs a result, Swift had plenty of time on stage as she picked up tour of the year; pop/rock album; and the most prestigious category of the night, artist of the year. (She also won female pop/rock artist, which wasn\u2019t televised.) While Swift didn\u2019t get anywhere near as political as she did in her Instagram post that blew up the Internet this week, she did have one message in her final speech.\n\n\u201cThis award and every single award given out tonight were voted on by the people,\u201d Swift said. \u201cAnd you know what else is voted on by the people is the midterm elections on Nov. 6. Get out and vote! I love you guys.\u201d\n\nHere are some highlights from the show, with a complete list of winners below.\n\n[What led Taylor Swift to post her political Instagram message?]\n\n1) Swift\u2019s performance and statement about her \u201creputation\u201d\n\nThe night frequently felt like the Taylor Swift Awards, as she kicked off the three-hour telecast with \u201cI Did Something Bad,\u201d her first live TV performance in nearly three years. There was little subtlety with the lyric, \u201cThey\u2019re burning all the witches even if you aren\u2019t one \u2014 they got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons.\u201d\n\nShe gestured to herself when she said \u201cwitches,\u201d likely referring to the Kanye West \u201cFamous\u201d incident and the backlash she received when the Internet decided she was a \u201csnake.\u201d During the performance, a gigantic serpent was seen behind her, as Swift has defiantly embraced the snake symbol on tour this year. Swift hinted at this all in her speech for pop/rock album for the appropriately-named \u201cReputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole time that I was writing an album based on all the facets of a reputation and how it affects you, what it actually means to you, I was surrounded by friends and family and loved ones who never loved me less based on the fluctuations of public opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cI always look at albums as chapters in my life, and to the fans, I\u2019m so happy that you like this one \u2026 but I have to be really honest with you about something: I\u2019m even more excited about the next chapter.\u201d\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift performs \"I Did Something Bad\" during the 2018 AMAs. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images for DCP)\n\n\n\nThe snake in question. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images For DCP)\n\n2) Cardi B\u2019s performance and speech\n\nCardi B walked away with three awards: rap/hip-hop song for \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d soul/R&B song for \u201cFinesse\u201d with Bruno Mars and rap/hip-hop artist. During her speech for the latter, she gave a shout-out to her 4-month-old daughter, and dismissed the haters who said she couldn\u2019t be a successful working mom.\n\n\u201cI gotta prove people wrong, cause they said I wasn\u2019t going to make it after I had a baby.\u201d She also waved to her husband in the audience, Offset, whose trio Migos later won pop/rock group.\n\nLater, Cardi B delivered a highly entertaining performance of \u201cI Like It\u201d with J Balvin and Bad Bunny, while effortlessly spinning around on a giant circle.\n\n3) The Aretha Franklin tribute\n\nA short video about the Queen of Soul aired toward the end of the show, and a group of powerhouse singers (Gladys Knight, CeCe Winans, Donnie McClurkin, Ledisi and Mary Mary) closed the ceremony with \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d \u201cMary, Don\u2019t You Weep,\u201d \u201cHow I Got Over\u201d and more.\n\n4) Mariah Carey\n\nWhat to even say about Carey\u2019s rendition of \u201cWith You,\u201d which she performed in an epic mermaid gown that hid quite a few male back-up dancers inside it? Twitter wasn\u2019t thrilled with her lip syncing capabilities, but it was riveting all the same.\n\n\n\nMariah Carey performs \"With You.\" (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)\n\n5) Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez\n\nJ-Lo belted out a ballad, \u201cLimitless,\u201d but her baseball star boyfriend also got some time in the spotlight. \u201cHello, Alex Rodriguez,\u201d Ross said, cornering him in the audience. \u201cSo, you are a baseball legend who played for the Yankees. And I just have one question: What do you do with your skin? Because it is like you wash your face in the tears of baby angels.\u201d\n\n\n\nJennifer Lopez performs \"Limitless.\" (Matt Sayles/Invision/AP)\n\nAlex Rodriguez just pulled a Jim from The Office. #AMAs pic.twitter.com/0sIWaNuHPb \u2014 E!

(Matt Sayles/Invision/AP)\n\n8) The few political references\n\nWhile presenting the award for adult contemporary artist with Kathryn Hahn, Billy Eichner delivered a plea to young people: \u201cThe biggest election of our lifetime is happening \u2026 please grab your friends, tell them to vote. Now is the time, if you believe in equality for women, for people of color, for the LGBTQ community, if you believe that climate change is real and that we need to do something about it. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you your vote won\u2019t count. It counts.

Which is exactly how many TV shows that I\u2019ve been on that have not gotten picked up.\u201d\n\nLater, Busy Philipps explained to co-presenter John Stamos why she no longer has a crush on him: \u201cThe poster on my wall started to age faster than you did and it freaked me out.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresenters Busy Philipps and John Stamos (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)\n\nComplete list of winners:\n\nArtist of the Year: Taylor Swift\n\nNew Artist of the Year: Camila Cabello\n\nFavorite Artist Rap/Hip-Hop: Cardi B\n\nFavorite Male Artist Pop/Rock: Post Malone\n\nTour of the Year: Taylor Swift, Reputation Stadium Tour\n\nFavorite Male Artist Soul/R&B: Khalid\n\nFavorite Song Pop/Rock: Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug \u201cHavana\u201d\n\nFavorite Female Artist Country: Carrie Underwood\n\nFavorite Artist Adult Contemporary: Shawn Mendes\n\nFavorite Duo or Group Pop/Rock: Migos\n\nFavorite Album Soul/R&B: XXXTENTACION \u201c17\u201d\n\nFavorite Album Pop/Rock: Taylor Swift \u201cReputation\u201d\n\nFavorite Male Artist Country: Kane Brown\n\nNon-televised awards:\n\nFavorite Duo or Group Country: Florida Georgia Line\n\nFavorite Album Country: Kane Brown \u201cKane Brown\u201d\n\nFavorite Song Country: Kane Brown \u201cHeaven\"\n\nFavorite Female Artist Pop/Rock: Taylor Swift\n\nFavorite Album Rap/Hip-Hop: Post Malone \u201cBeerbongs & Bentlys\u201d\n\nFavorite Song Rap/Hip-Hop: Cardi B \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d\n\nFavorite Female Artist Soul/R&B: Rihanna\n\nFavorite Song Soul/R&B: Bruno Mars & Cardi B \u201cFinesse\u201d\n\nFavorite Music Video: Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug \u201cHavana\u201d\n\nFavorite Artist Alternative Rock: Panic!

  "text": "In the early stages of a fetus\u2019s development in the womb, two embryological structures move to either side of the spine, just below the ribs, and form a pair of bean-shaped organs that will be the kidneys.\n\nBut in extremely rare cases, the two structures fuse in the middle, forming one kidney. And instead of moving up toward the ribs, it sinks to the pelvic area. Its odd, disc-like shape has given rise to a buffet of food names. Scientists call it a pancake kidney because it\u2019s flat. It\u2019s also called a cake kidney, a doughnut kidney, a shield kidney and a lump kidney.\n\nThis anomaly can go unnoticed for years and is usually diagnosed only accidentally. Such is the case of an 18-year-old man who recently showed up at an emergency room in New Delhi with symptoms of bowel obstruction. In examining a scan of his abdomen, doctors saw that his kidneys are joined in the middle and sit just above his bladder, according to a report published last week by the medical journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\n[A woman showed up at a hospital struggling to breathe \u2014 because of a 61-pound tumor in her uterus]\n\nThere are multiple types of kidney or renal fusion, and pancake kidney, which is more common among men, is the most extreme, accounting for less than 10 percent of anomalies, according to the report.\n\nA similar case was reported in New Delhi in 2014, when a 19-year-old woman showed up at a hospital\u2019s outpatient department with pain her in lower abdomen, fever and burning sensation when she urinated. A scan showed a fused mass \u2014 her kidney \u2014 in her pelvic cavity.\n\nIn another case reported in Jordan last year, a 32-year-old man showed up at a clinic with abdominal pain. An ultrasound and a CT scan showed that his kidney was one flat, nearly rectangular mass located on the right side of his abdomen.\n\nA more common type of kidney fusion is called the horseshoe kidney, in which the lower side of two kidneys fuse during the early stages of development and form one U-shaped organ. There\u2019s also the L-shaped kidney, in which an abnormal kidney is positioned horizontally and attached to the bottom of the normal one. In some cases, one kidney goes directly below the other, forming a vertical organ.\n\n[The shocking reason that this man\u2019s legs and hands were amputated: A dog\u2019s saliva]\n\nHaving a fused kidney does not mean the organ will fail, and doctors generally don\u2019t recommended invasive surgeries to correct it. Kidney functions tend to be normal, and since most people don\u2019t show symptoms, doctors prefer regular checkups to make sure the kidneys are functioning properly.\n\nThose with these abnormalities, however, are more prone to urinary tract infection and urinary stasis, or the inability to empty the bladder. They\u2019re also more likely to develop certain cancers, such as Wilms tumor, a kidney cancer common among children; renal cell carcinoma, which is common among older men; and rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer that forms in soft tissue, according to the BMJ Case Report.\n\nSomeone with a horseshoe kidney, for example, is almost twice as likely to have Wilms tumor compared with someone with normal renal anatomy, according to the report. In the case of a pancake kidney, however, cases are so rare that it\u2019s impossible to determine the likelihood of developing cancer.\n\nRead more:\n\nShe modeled in New York and worked for the Navy.

  "text": "\n\nThe NCAA put the kibosh on Roy Williams's benefit for Hurricane Florence relief. (Gerry Broome/Associated Press)\n\nNever let it be said that the NCAA doesn\u2019t stick to its rules. This time, though, North Carolina Coach Roy Williams said he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d by college sports' governing body.\n\nThe NCAA last week denied a waiver that would have allowed North Carolina and South Carolina to play a benefit exhibition basketball game with the proceeds going to Hurricane Florence relief, a decision that Williams admitted left him in disbelief.\n\n\u201cI was dumbfounded when the waiver was not granted,\u201d Williams told reporters during the team\u2019s media day in Chapel Hill, N.C.\n\nThe stumbling block is that the NCAA allows schools to play two exhibition games, one public and one \u201csecret\u201d (in a closed gym with no reporters, no acknowledgment by coaches and no stats listed). The NCAA had approved several hurricane relief games last season and approved a game between Clemson and North Carolina Wilmington this year. But South Carolina is already hosting Augusta University in an exhibition game later this month and will face Virginia Tech in its \u201cclosed scrimmage.\u201d North Carolina plays Mount Olive in an exhibition next month and its secret scrimmage is later this month at Villanova. Neither school wanted to change its plans, which meant a waiver was needed for a third game.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only charity game the NCAA put the kibosh on, for the same reason. It won\u2019t allow Kentucky and Notre Dame to play a third game, ESPN\u2019s Jeff Goodman reported. Kentucky already has two exhibitions scheduled. Last year, the NCAA granted Kentucky a waiver for a third charity exhibition game and the Kentucky Cares Classic against Morehead State raised nearly $450,000.\n\n\u201cOur state and South Carolina had a terrible tragedy, a horrific storm come through, whatever you want to call it,\u201d Williams said (via the Observer). \u201cAnd I called [Gamecocks Coach] Frank [Martin] to see if he would be interested in playing a game [in Charlotte].\n\n\u201cI called him and said, \u2018Nobody\u2019s been hurt as badly as we have, North Carolina and South Carolina, with Florence.\u2019 And we asked for a waiver to see if we could play. I\u2019m not trying to gain an advantage on anybody. I don\u2019t think we can gain an advantage on anybody. But we were willing to play each other.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take it to Charlotte because it would be closer between the two schools, and play a game and give all the money \u2014 all the money \u2014 to [charity].\"\n\nWilliams even had a pretty powerful and persuasive ace up his sleeve: potential involvement by Michael Jordan, owner of the Charlotte Hornets and former UNC star. \u201cI was going to try to convince a guy that I know pretty well that owns the building in Charlotte to give us a great rate,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, coaches at all levels and in all sports have been known to look for any kind of competitive advantage, but Williams swears that wasn\u2019t his motive.\n\n\"If you guys can convince me how that was going to help North Carolina\u2019s basketball team or South Carolina\u2019s basketball team over somebody else, then I\u2019ll listen to it. But that was not the intent.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the scenes of people\u2019s stuff out on the street, you want to do something. And that\u2019s sadly what we saw. We saw so many situations, people losing everything they have. And we had what I thought was one of the few good ideas I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nFifty-one people lost their lives when Florence, a Category 1 storm, brought devastating floods to the region in mid-September.

  "text": "\n\nTuesday's elimination brings questions to a talented Yankees team that hasn't been able to break through. (Julie Jacobson/Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 The danger for any newly eliminated postseason team is in going too far in its internal analysis of what went wrong, and in seeing fatal flaws that must be swiftly and aggressively corrected when, in reality, those are just the way baseball goes sometimes. Did the New York Yankees lose the American League Division Series, in other words, because they were a decidedly lesser team than the Boston Red Sox across four games? Or did they lose because of outfield dimensions?\n\nThat\u2019s an oversimplification of the questions the Yankees now face, of course, but as they pick up the pieces from Tuesday night\u2019s 4-3 loss in Game 4 and head into a difficult and pivotal offseason, amid their painful self-evaluation will be this underlying notion:\n\nIf Gary Sanchez\u2019s dramatic ninth-inning blast to left field had been hit at Fenway Park, instead of Yankee Stadium, it would have cleared the Green Monster for a go-ahead grand slam instead of dying at the warning track as a long, high out. And for that matter, if Christian Vazquez\u2019s drive to right in the Red Sox\u2019s half of the fourth inning was hit at Fenway, it would have been caught for an out rather than leaving the park. Either twist of fate could have saved the Yankees\u2019 season.\n\n\u201cIf that was on the road, it\u2019s probably a home run,\u201d Yankees third baseman Neil Walker said of Sanchez\u2019s towering flyball. \u201cIf it was the right field, it\u2019s probably a home run. That ninth inning was a synopsis of our season, if you ask me.\u201d\n\n[Red Sox hang on \u2014 barely \u2014 to eliminate Yankees and advance to ALCS]\n\nThe flaws-versus-fates questions hang over every good team that sees its season end in October, but they seem particularly acute for the 2018 Yankees, who spent the better part of six months chasing the Red Sox in the AL East, only to lose the division by eight games, then spent the better part of four nights in October being outpitched, outhit and outmanaged by them.\n\nBut are the Red Sox significantly better than them? Or did they simply enjoy better health across 162 games, then simply outplay them for these last four? Do the Yankees need to get better, or do they need to play better when it matters most?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always chasing utopia,\u201d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cWe\u2019re chasing greatness here. . . . Obviously, we have some decisions, a lot of things that are going to happen between now and next year. But I think we\u2019re right there knocking on the door to be that. I mean, we\u2019re very close to being a championship club right now. We\u2019ve just got to improve on the margins in every facet.\u201d\n\n\n\nAaron Boone might need to do some self-reflection after his first season as manager. (Julie Jacobson/Associated Press)\n\nAt some point, the quest to improve on the margins must almost certainly include some self-examination from Boone, a first-year manager in 2018, over his pitching moves in Games 3 and 4. In two critical games, the second of which had the Yankees facing elimination, he was slow to pull his starting pitcher and deploy his bullpen \u2014 the clearest and most acute advantage the Yankees held over the Red Sox. Boone\u2019s choices didn\u2019t lose either game for New York, but they stood out in this era of bullpen supremacy and were picked apart at length in the media.\n\nA year ago, Boone was in the ESPN booth doing color commentary. As a rookie manager, he surely has room to improve, and before Game 4, he seemed to acknowledge that.\n\n\u201cYou always kind of work through things or play out things differently [in your mind],\u201d Boone said, \u201cbecause a lot of times decisions you make are not just black and white: \u2018This is what we\u2019re doing in this spot.\u2019 They\u2019re decisions [in which] you understand [there are] a couple of different ways you could go that makes some sense. You evaluate those, and think about those, and hopefully analyze [and] sharpen the process as far as [how] those decisions are made. And then you move on and hopefully always continue to grow.\u201d\n\nThe primary personnel decisions the Yankees face this winter are fairly standard. They have pending free agents in starters J.A. Happ and CC Sabathia and relievers David Robertson and Zach Britton. They hold a club option on veteran outfielder Brett Gardner. They will almost certainly target starting pitching this winter, though it is not a particularly deep free agent class.\n\nThe Red Sox, of course, will be shopping, too \u2014 Boston had the highest payroll in the majors in 2018 \u2014 and the Yankees can only hope they do better vis-a-vis their archrivals in the talent marketplace than they did over the past 10 months.\n\nIn December, after the Yankees traded for Giancarlo Stanton, the Red Sox signed J.D. Martinez. Stanton struggled in his first season in the Bronx. Martinez became an MVP contender in Boston. In July, the Yankees acquired Happ for their rotation; the Red Sox picked up Nathan Eovaldi. Happ, after a fine showing in the second half of the season, lasted just two innings against the Red Sox in a Game 1 loss. Eovaldi, in Game 3, pitched seven sterling innings.\n\nSome of the Yankees\u2019 personnel questions are deeper and require more self-examination. What happened this season to Sanchez and Greg Bird, two young players considered franchise cornerstones who performed below expectations? How can they coax more production out of Stanton \u2014 the hulking slugger and highest-paid player in the game who is also a strikeout machine? In one of the most critical at-bats of the Yankees\u2019 season, in Tuesday night\u2019s ninth inning, he struck out against Kimbrel, giving a lifeline to a laboring pitcher who desperately needed one.\n\n\n\nGiancarlo Stanton, left, the Yankees' big offseason acquisition, struck out in a key at-bat in the ninth inning Tuesday. (Julie Jacobson/Associated Press)\n\n\u201cI have to put the ball in play there,\u201d Stanton told reporters Tuesday night. \u201cI have to get a pitch over the plate and keep the line moving. . . . I\u2019m going to use this for fuel for next year. I think we all are.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees hit more homers than any team in history in 2018, 267 of them, but in Games 3 and 4 they were held without one \u2014 the first time since early April that had happened in consecutive games at home. The Yankees were 4 for 26 (.184) in the series with runners in scoring position, managing only one extra-base hit. Did the Yankees\u2019 hitters choke? Are they too dependent on power? Did the Red Sox\u2019s pitchers shut them down? Or are sudden, team-wide slumps just part of baseball?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always chasing to be the most complete hitter you can be,\u201d Boone said, \u201cto be the best base-running team. . . . That [means] better in every aspect: better at getting on base, better at slugging, better at putting the ball in play.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, as the Yankees were in the midst of a rebuilding effort \u2014 or as close to it as the Yankees were willing to get \u2014 the \u201cBaby Bombers,\u201d as they became known, surprised many in the sport by winning 91 games and advancing to Game 7 of the AL Championship Series before falling to the Houston Astros.\n\nBut this year, expectations were higher, and in many ways the Yankees met them, winning 100 games despite injuries to Sanchez, Aaron Judge, Jordan Montgomery and others. Their deep bullpen \u2014 arguably the best ever constructed \u2014 gave them the sense they could take down the Red Sox in the playoffs, despite losing the division to them by eight games.\n\nThat the Yankees fell short is cause for reflection and self-evaluation over these next few months. But is this a franchise that needs to make massive changes? Or do the Yankees just need to go back to a point in time before Tuesday night\u2019s ninth inning, and bring the left field fence at Yankee Stadium in another five feet? On such fleeting, fantastical questions are championships won and lost.\n\nRead more:\n\nMLB analyst Ron Darling is offended that Red Sox kept trying in a playoff game\n\nThe Cleveland Indians\u2019 season is over, and so is Chief Wahoo\u2019s 71-year run\n\nThe Indians lost in the ALDS again.

Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as a \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d Category 4 storm \u2014 the strongest hurricane on record to hit the area \u2014 and continued to charge north, wreaking havoc and causing emergencies. Darkness concealed the full extent of the damage left behind, but a second death was reported early Thursday, apparently caused by debris crashing through a mobile home and killing a child inside.\n\nSee the latest from the Capital Weather Gang here and track the storm\u2019s path here.\n\n9:15 a.m. update: More than 715,000 power outages reported across Southeast\n\nThe storm has knocked out power to more than 715,000 across the Southeastern United States, with about half of the outages occurring in Florida, where Michael first made landfall Wednesday as a powerful system.\n\nFlorida officials reported about 359,000 outages as of Thursday morning, with power entirely or largely knocked out in counties including Bay, Gulf and Jackson. In Georgia, more than 176,000 customers lacked power on Thursday morning. South Carolina had about 114,000 outages, while North Carolina (more than 23,000 outages) and Alabama (about 43,000 outages) both had wide swaths of people without power.\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\n8:44 a.m.: Michael moves over South Carolina and heads for North Carolina\n\nAfter wreaking havoc across the Florida Panhandle and Georgia, the storm\u2019s center was moving over South Carolina on Thursday morning, its tropical-storm-force winds extending out across that state and Georgia, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm was about 40 miles west of Columbia, S.C., at 8 a.m., and tropical storm warnings extended from Georgia through the Carolinas. The strongest winds were mostly spreading north along the coastlines of the Carolinas, with maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, the center said.\n\nThe hurricane center said Michael would keep moving quickly toward the northeast. On its current track, the storm is forecast to move through the center of South Carolina on Thursday morning, then rumble across parts of central and eastern North Carolina before shifting across southeastern Virginia in the afternoon or evening. Forecasters say Michael is expected to move out into the Atlantic Ocean by late Thursday or early Friday.\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\n8:17 a.m.: Florida Gov. Rick Scott: \u2018Stay safe\u2019\n\nBefore heading to the Gulf Coast to survey the damage, Gov. Rick Scott (R) had a message for Floridians: \u201cYou survived this unbelievable storm; stay safe.\u201d\n\nThere are downed power lines and downed trees \u201call over the place,\u201d Scott said on CNN, noting that there was \u201cunbelievable devastation.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay in your house, listen to the locals, be safe \u2014 don\u2019t do anything foolish,\u201d said Scott.\n\nTwo Michael-related deaths have been confirmed, including one in Florida, and the governor noted that \u201cwe have a lot of people I\u2019ve heard are injured.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMy biggest concern would be loss of life.\u201d\n\n\u2014 J.

But the early indicators are troubling.\n\nConsider what storm chaser Josh Morgerman tweeted Wednesday night: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convey in words the scale of the catastrophe in Panama City. The whole city looks like a nuke was dropped on it. I\u2019m literally shocked at the scale of the destruction.\u201d\n\nMorgerman has chased some of the most extreme hurricanes and typhoons across the world. As the Capital Weather Gang noted, \u201che is not prone to hyperbole.\u201d\n\nEarly Thursday, he said that Michael was \u201cdefinitely one of the most violent [hurricanes] I\u2019ve been in.\u201d\n\nAnother storm chaser, Mark Sudduth, tweeted: \u201cDrove from Panama City almost to Mexico Beach and I can tell you this is the worst damage from wind that I have ever seen!

Freedom du Lac\n\n5 a.m.: Michael continues to weaken as the storm heads toward the Carolinas.\n\nTropical Storm Michael keeps getting weaker as it crosses rain-soaked Georgia and moves northeast toward South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest update. By 2 a.m., sustained winds had decreased to 60 mph; at 5 a.m., they had fallen to 50 mph.\n\nHowever, the center said, winds have picked up at certain points along the Georgia and South Carolina coast. Large parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia could still see deadly flash floods today and remain under a tropical storm warning.\n\nThe storm\u2019s center is currently about 30 miles west of Augusta, Ga., near the South Carolina border. Forecasters expect that Michael will continue to weaken today as the storm travels over land, likely reaching central South Carolina this morning. Once Michael reaches the Atlantic, the storm is expected to intensify again as it becomes a post-tropical low.\n\n\u2014 Antonia Farzan\n\n[People are freaking out over this \u2018creepy skull\u2019 spotted in Hurricane Michael\u2019s satellite imagery]\n\n3:30 a.m.: Apple CEO, a Gulf Coast native, pledges to help with recovery.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Apple CEO Tim Cook pledged that the company would help with recovery and relief efforts. \u201cI grew up on the shores of the Gulf Coast, near Pensacola and Mobile, and that region holds a special place in my heart,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s never been more true than now.\u201d\n\nCook grew up in Robertsdale, Ala., a city of roughly 5,200 people located roughly halfway between Mobile and Pensacola, Fla.

The girl had been inside a trailer home in an unincorporated area of the county near Lake Seminole, close to the Florida-Georgia border. From what officials could determine, Brooks said, it looked like a metal carport used to store boats had been lifted in the air by the gusting winds and had flipped over. When it landed, its legs crashed through the roof of a neighboring mobile home and hit the girl in the head.\n\n\u201cIt looked like a war zone,\u201d Brooks said, adding that it had taken deputies from the Seminole County Sheriff\u2019s Office practically all day to get to the mobile home due to the road conditions in the area. The death is the second known fatality connected with Hurricane Michael, which has since been downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\n\u2014 Antonia Farzan\n\n1:30 a.m.: Michael weakens to a tropical storm over South-Central Georgia.\n\nAfter crushing the Florida coast, Hurricane Michael weakened as it passed through south-central Georgia on Wednesday night. By midnight, peak winds had dropped to 70 mph, causing forecasters to reclassify it as a tropical storm. Heavy rainfall is expected to continue drenching Georgia through the early hours of the morning, with a threat of flash flooding overnight.\n\nMeanwhile, the Waffle House near Florida State University\u2019s campus in Tallahassee was open for business at 12:28 a.m., with lines stretching out the door. FEMA officials famously use the Waffle House Index as a way of measuring storm damage: Since the diner chain is ubiquitous in the southeast, and rarely shuts down in extreme weather, seeing the Waffle House closed down before a storm is a sign that things are about to get extremely bad. If the Waffle House hasn\u2019t reopened after the storm, FEMA considers that a sign that the area has experienced major devastation.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a Waffle House spokesman had announced that 30 restaurants in Florida and Georgia were closed in preparation for Hurricane Michael, including locations along the Florida Panhandle from Panama City to Destin. It was a clear warning that the storm should be taken seriously.\n\n\u2014 Antonia Farzan\n\n10:35 p.m.: Stunning visuals from Florida\n\nBefore the sun went down and the skies turned midnight blue, those in the path of Hurricane Michael shared glimpses of what some say is the worst hurricane damage they\u2019ve seen. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of getting crushed,\u201d Franklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith said to The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nHere are three photos that capture the awe such a powerful storm brings.\n\n\n\nA car is seen caught in floodwaters in Panama City, Fla.

Smith, the sheriff of Franklin County, a coastal patch south of Tallahassee, told CNN that the county was nearly isolated after most of the main roads were rendered impassable from flooding and downed trees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through hurricanes but never where we were completely cut off like this.\u201d\n\nLinda Albrecht, a councilwoman in Mexico Beach, spoke to the network about leaving her home with only a few essential objects.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a nightmare,\u201d she said. \u201cLooking at the pictures, I\u2019m thinking there is not a house left in that town.\u201d\n\nDowntown Panama City proper got hit way harder than Panama City Beach.

A dangerous storm surge continued along the coastal Florida panhandle; a National Ocean Service station in Apalachicola was reporting 5 feet of water above the ground level.\n\nAnd tornado warnings radiated out into counties near the hurricane\u2019s path in Georgia on Tuesday evening, after reports of at least two that had formed in Florida. Officials issued brief tornado warnings for Fulton, Douglas and Cobb counties. More than 40,000 people lost power across the state.\n\n#HurricaneMichael was captured from the space station today after the storm made landfall as a category 4 hurricane over the Florida panhandle.

An October surprise that raced across the Gulf, Michael could go down in the record books as the third-strongest hurricane to hit the continental United States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of getting crushed,\u201d Franklin County Sheriff A.J.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe powerful eastern side of the storm clobbered the modest coastal community of Mexico Beach, where some structures disintegrated into piles of wood amid massive waves and heavy flooding. In nearby Panama City Beach, homes were shredded and boats tossed. In Marianna, Fla., about 18 miles south of the Alabama state line, Michael\u2019s eye tore through the community.\n\n\u201cI had a yard full of 20-inch pine trees and there\u2019s not one left standing,\u201d said Chad Taylor, 66, a land manager in Marianna. \u201cI can see for miles and miles,\u201d he added, quoting the rock band the Who. \u201cMarianna\u2019s destroyed.\u201d\n\nWhat Hurricane Michael looked and sounded like as it made landfall View Graphic PANAMA CITY, FL - OCTOBER 10: Debris is blown down a street by Hurricane Michael on October 10, 2018 in Panama City, Florida.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nPower outages soared through the day, reaching more than 300,000 by Wednesday evening, with nearly 90 percent of Bay County \u2014 home to Mexico Beach and Panama City \u2014 losing power. Nearby Liberty County had 81 percent of accounts without power, the state reported.\n\nBay Medical Sacred Heart hospital in Panama City reported on Twitter that it suffered blown-out windows, a cracked wall and roof damage, and had shifted patients to safe areas while the hospital ran on generator power.\n\nThe bayfront city of Apalachicola, Florida\u2019s oyster capital, suffered severe flooding and property damage along aptly named Water Street, home to several restaurants. The city was temporarily cut off from the rest of the state, with U.S. Highway 98 to the west blocked by pine trees and oak branches; going east was unthinkable because the causeway had vanished under the elevated water of Apalachicola Bay.\n\nSmith, the Franklin County sheriff, said the county-run hospital had closed, and ambulance staff had evacuated \u2014 to his dismay.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Smith said Wednesday morning. \u201cWould I like to get out of here? Heck, yeah. Am I leaving? No.\u201d\n\nFormer Franklin County planner Alan Pierce said after the storm blew through that the area endured a storm surge as high as 10 feet. Officials were still trying to determine damage on barrier islands, including St. George Island, which has a state park, a small central business district and a gated community of luxury homes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Pierce said. He noted that the wind gauge at the county airport blew off after recording gusts of 90 mph.\n\nOther states felt the storm\u2019s impact as it moved deeper into the Southeast. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) closed state offices and buildings in more than a dozen counties. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) declared the second statewide state of emergency in as many months. He said the storm could do damage in areas still reeling from the flooding Hurricane Florence caused in September, with housing repairs there still in the early stages.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot blue tarps as I\u2019ve traveled across the state,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThese tropical storm force winds could cause a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nCooper announced a plan for $1.5 billion in additional state funding to cover part of the estimated $13 billion cost of Hurricane Florence. He\u2019s requesting that legislators approve a $750 million down payment for the recovery package when they return to Raleigh next week to resume a special session called after the disaster. He said the total cost of the storm is likely to surpass the costs of hurricanes Matthew (2016) and Floyd (1999) combined.\n\nMichael seemed to have caught everyone off guard, from meteorologists who study tropical cyclones to the longtime residents who chose to hunker down rather than evacuate.\n\nA mere tropical depression just three days earlier, Michael intensified explosively as it rolled north in the warm Gulf of Mexico and into the shallow waters of the continental shelf. It was ultimately a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, just a couple of miles per hour shy of reaching Category 5.\n\n\n\nDamaged homes in Panama City Beach, Fla. on Wednesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIt was the most powerful tropical storm to hit the Florida Panhandle since record-keeping began in 1851. Just two hurricanes have ever hit the United States with barometric pressure readings in the eye \u2014 a key metric of a storm\u2019s effects \u2014 lower than the 919 millibars of Michael. They were the 1935 Labor Day storm (892mb) that struck the Florida Keys, and Hurricane Camille (900mb), which killed hundreds when it hit coastal Mississippi in 1969.\n\n\u201cThis storm went from a tropical storm to a projected Cat 3 at landfall in six hours yesterday,\u201d Brad Kieserman, vice president for disaster operations and logistics for the American Red Cross, said in a teleconference Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not behaving normally. It intensified extremely quickly. It didn\u2019t give anyone time to do much. And the one thing you can\u2019t get back in a disaster is time.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump said of Michael: \u201cIt\u2019s like a big tornado, a massive tornado.\u201d He said the storm \u201cgrew into a monster.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service\u2019s Tallahassee office thundered on Twitter early Wednesday morning that it was residents\u2019 \u201cLAST CHANCE\u201d to evacuate. \u201cHurricane Michael is an unprecedented event and cannot be compared to any of our previous events. Do not risk your life, leave NOW if you were told to do so.\u201d\n\nThe storm\u2019s eye struck just east of Panama City and the high-rise tourist hotels parked along white-sand beaches.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe storm\u2019s path and the need for emergency management potentially carried political significance for Gov. Rick Scott (R), who is running for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Bill Nelson (D), and for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D), who is seeking to succeed Scott in a contest against Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re turning 100 percent of our focus on search-and-rescue and recovery,\u201d Scott said in a late-day news briefing.\n\nThe governor said he\u2019s received reports of \u201csignificant\u201d damage at Tyndall Air Force Base as well as in Panama City, Mexico Beach and throughout Bay County. Two \u201cdevastating tornadoes\u201d touched down in Gaston County, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are deploying a massive wave of responses by land, air and sea,\u201d he said.\n\nGeography probably played a role in storm damage, for better or worse. This is Florida\u2019s poorest region, with a relatively high percentage of residents living in vulnerable housing, such as mobile homes.\n\nBut it is not a heavily populated area. The more powerful eastern side of the storm struck a region known as Florida\u2019s \u201cForgotten Coast.\u201d\n\nMore than 300,000 people live in evacuation zones along or near the coast, and as of Tuesday night 6,000 people were in 80 emergency shelters, the Red Cross\u2019s Kieserman said. He predicted that the number of people seeking shelter will rise to 20,000 or greater as people flee flooded and damaged coastal homes. He urged people who want to help those in need to donate money to disaster aid organizations rather than attempting to deliver food and supplies.\n\n\u201cWe will be in for a long-term sheltering mission,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal officials warned residents in the storm zone against venturing out after the worst of the storm passes, because hazards remain. The storm weakened when it hit land but retained hurricane-force winds.\n\n\u201cMichael\u2019s still a strong, powerful hurricane, well inland. It\u2019s going to have hurricane impacts well into Georgia,\u201d said Jeff Byard, FEMA\u2019s associate administrator for response and recovery.\n\nHe said FEMA is well positioned to handle the back-to-back hurricanes \u2014 Florence and now Michael \u2014 in part because both are in the same region and emergency responders are well acquainted with each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to handle another storm if it hits next week,\u201d Byard said, adding that he hopes he hasn\u2019t jinxed the region.\n\n\n\nThis photo made available by NASA shows the eye of Hurricane Michael, as seen from the International Space Station on Wednesday.

The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. This pressure - if unchanged at landfall - would be lower than Hurricane Andrew when it struck South Florida and Katrina when it struck southeast Louisiana. \u201cOnly two continental US hurricanes have made landfall with a lower pressure,\u201d tweeted hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach - the 1935 Labor Day hurricane (892 millibars) and Camille in 1969 (900 millibars).\n\n\n\nHurricane Michael about to make landfall at 1 p.m. Wednesday. (NOAA)\n\nBased on its peak wind speed of 150 mph, it is the second strongest storm on record so far north, only trailing Camille, Klotzbach added.\n\nAt 1 p.m., the storm\u2019s center was just 15 miles west-southwest of Mexico Beach and 20 miles south of Panama City, meaning landfall is likely in the next hour or so.\n\n12:50 p.m.: Wind gusts topping 100 mph as eyewall begins to come ashore\n\nThe eyewall, the most intense part of Hurricane Michael surrounding its calm eye, is coming ashore just to the east of Panama Beach.

As the storm is moving north-northeast at 14 mph, landfall could occur within two to three hours.\n\nWinds and water levels continued increasing. Apalachicola recently recorded a gust to 76 mph.\n\n11:45 a.m.: Michael is still strengthening: Winds up to 150 mph.\n\nAt 11:30 a.m., the Hurricane Center sent out a special advisory indicating peak winds had increased to 150 mph, which is just 7 mph shy of Category 5.\n\nThe storm\u2019s pressure fell further, down to 923 millibars. (The lower the pressure, the stronger the storm.) If this pressure holds, it will rank as the third lowest on record at landfall in the state of Florida and sixth lowest to strike the U.S. coast.\n\nAlong the Florida Panhandle, winds continued to ramp up as gusts hit 72 mph in Apalachicola.\n\n11:35 a.m.: Alarm bells raised for central and east Georgia\n\nBecause Michael has become so strong so fast, the National Weather Service issued a special advisory for central and eastern Georgia warning of a \u201cpotentially historical tropical event.\u201d\n\nIt warned of hurricane-force winds and the potential for the downing of \u201chundreds to potentially thousands of trees.\u201d It also said tornadoes were possible and rainfall of more than five inches, which could cause localized flash flooding.\n\n\u201cWith this being the tail end of Hurricane Season and with the long ordeal of Hurricane Florence for some, it can be easy to become complacent,\u201d it cautioned. \u201cThis is not the storm to do that with!!\u201d\n\n11:10 a.m.: Core of Michael closing in on Florida Panhandle, life-threatening hazards \u2018imminent'\n\nIn its 11 a.m. advisory, the Hurricane Center said life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall were \u201cimminent\u201d along the coast of the Florida Panhandle. The storm was centered just 60 miles south-southwest of Panama City and headed north-northeast at 15 mph meaning landfall could occur within a three to four hours.\n\nWinds were gusting over 60 mph at Bald Point, Fla., which is to the east of Apalachicola. Tallahassee, to the north, had clocked a gust to 46 mph. These winds will rapidly increase over the next few hours, reaching hurricane-force.\n\nThe storm surge in Apalachicola had already reached 6 feet, close to its record height of 6.4 feet, and waters were continuing to rise.\n\nA look from above as Hurricane Michael gets closer to the Florida panhandle.

Assuming pressure don\u2019t rise before landfall, Michael\u2019s will rank among the top 10 lowest on record for a landfalling storm in the United States.\n\n10:35 a.m.: Tropical storm conditions spread over Florida Panhandle as storm\u2019s pressure tanks\n\nTropical storm conditions swept over Florida\u2019s Panhandle Wednesday morning and a wind gust of 58 was clocked at Apalachicola Regional Airport between 9 and 10 a.m. The Hurricane Center also reported water levels were rising quickly at the coast.\n\nUPDATE: NOAA's #GOES16 shows the explosive energy of #HurricaneMichael, captured in this \"sandwich loop\" -- a combination of visible and infrared imagery -- this morning, Oct. 10, 2018.

The storm surge was predicted to reach up to 14 feet potentially inundating more than 325 miles of coastline, including roads, homes and business.\n\nPopulation centers that could witness some of the most severe hurricane effects include Fort Walton Beach, Destin, Panama City Beach and Apalachicola.\n\n\u201c#Michael will make new history for central Panhandle, Big Bend,\u201d tweeted Rick Knabb, the Weather Channel\u2019s hurricane expert. \u201cSome of you could get water and wind worse than ever before.\u201d\n\nWhile the most severe hurricane conditions are expected along the coast, devastating hurricane effects are forecast to expand considerable distances inland.\n\n\u201cA potentially catastrophic event is developing,\u201d wrote the National Weather Service forecast office serving Tallahassee and surrounding areas. The office warned of \u201cwidespread power outages, downed trees blocking access to roads and endangering individuals, structural damage to homes and businesses, isolated flash flooding and the potential for a few tornadoes.\u201d\n\nDamaging winds and flooding rain were also predicted to reach southern Georgia and southeast Alabama on Wednesday and Wednesday night.\n\nBy Wednesday night and Thursday, heavy rains from Michael are likely to streak into the Carolinas, perhaps bringing more flooding to some of the same areas still recovering from Hurricane Florence.\n\nStorm surge\n\nWaters have mostly receded but may remain elevated by several feet from Panama City to Keaton Beach, Fla. through Wednesday night.\n\nWind\n\nAs Michael\u2019s eyewall continues to collapse, the most severe winds will weaken, but potentially damaging winds will still impact southwest and southwest Georgia.\n\nWhile hurricane-force winds of over 74 mph will be confined to a relatively small area, tropical-storm-force winds of 39 to 73 mph will occur over a much larger zone and could result in minor structural damage and many downed trees and power outages.\n\nRain\n\nThe Hurricane Center projects widespread rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches, from the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend areas north into southeast Alabama and southwest and central Georgia, and isolated amounts of up to a foot. \u201cThis rainfall could lead to life-threatening flash floods,\u201d it said.\n\nHeavy rain could arrive in southern Alabama and southern Georgia early Wednesday. By Wednesday night and into Thursday, heavy rain will rapidly streak through Georgia and into the Carolinas.\n\n\n\nProjected total rainfall from Hurricane Michael. (NOAA)\n\nRainfall of 3 to 6 inches is likely to affect some of the areas recovering from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas, which could lead to more flooding. Parts of eastern Georgia, southern Virginia, and the southern Delmarva Peninsula may also receive 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher amounts.\n\nThe rain is expected to reach the eastern Mid-Atlantic late Wednesday night into Thursday before rapidly exiting by Friday, where 1 to 3 inches is most likely, with locally higher amounts.",

  "text": "Colleen Washington had never seen the inside of an emergency shelter before Wednesday. She hadn\u2019t planned on it, either, until the clouds darkened and the sirens blared and a police officer yelled that everyone in her tiny inland neighborhood needed to leave.\n\n\u201cIn my 58 years, I have never evacuated,\u201d she said to an old friend, who also was taking refuge inside the gymnasium at Lawton Chiles High School in Tallahassee. \u201cBut, girl, we had to evacuate. I have grandchildren, and I needed to go.\u201d\n\nAs Hurricane Michael barreled toward Florida\u2019s Panhandle, an unfamiliar feeling struck the state\u2019s hilly capital city Wednesday morning: panic. Eighty miles inland, residents were used to the dangers of downed trees and power lines. But after the hurricane was upgraded to a life-threatening Category 4 storm overnight, residents raced to the city\u2019s largest hurricane shelter.\n\nAbout 100 people were inside Tuesday night. By Wednesday afternoon, there were 330 residents, 149 cats and dogs, and one parakeet. Many of the residents had reached the gym in the moments before the doors were closed.\n\n\u201cI was scrambling,\u201d Washington told her friend as she recounted her family\u2019s rush to safety.\n\nHer daughters picked up all the water bottles in their home and some vienna sausages. Her granddaughters gathered up their tablets and some crossword puzzles. They packed their pit bull, Gracie, and traveled 30 miles to the largest shelter in Tallahassee.\n\nThere, they joined dozens of others hustling to get inside before the gym doors closed at noon.\n\nThomas Haygood, a librarian, and his girlfriend, Brigitte Gonzalez, a billing specialist, followed the signs on the high school campus that said, \u201cpet-friendly shelter\u201d with their two soaking wet bloodhounds, Holly and Scarlet.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure we were going to make it,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cWe were going to be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nThey live on the second floor of a squat, two-story stucco apartment building with a floor-to-ceiling window in the living room. Their first instinct was to move their twin mattress to the hallway to escape any injury if the window broke. Then, they thought it might be better to move the mattress to protect the window from shattering. Eventually, Haygood\u2019s sister in Birmingham, Ala., called and told them to get out of the apartment.\n\nThey called a couple hotels but didn\u2019t have the money to pay for them. So they chose the hurricane shelter. They grabbed what they could: frozen water bottles, some Gala apples and mixed nuts.\n\nThey gave Holly medication to keep her calm and hoped Scarlet wouldn\u2019t betray her natural fondness for people.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would live through something this bad,\u201d Haygood said. \u201cIt all still doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nThe gym had filled with tents, inflatable mattresses and sleeping bags. Some residents came with walkers; others carried strollers. On one end of the room, a handful of evacuees watched an expanding, animated cone churn on cable news; on the other end, an 11-year-old set down some blankets where he placed his 32-inch television to play video games.\n\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s orderly here,\u201d Washington\u2019s friend, Dorothy McCaskill, said. She had been to this shelter three times in three years. Her neighbors came, too, and it was just as well, since they lived close to the school.\n\n\u201cWhen I moved here 20 or 30 years ago, we didn\u2019t have these tornadoes and hurricanes in this part of Florida,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cNow we get one every year. It\u2019s just nature now. Everything is changing.\u201d\n\nWashington doesn\u2019t remember ever feeling remotely frightened about an act of God. The closest was Hurricane Kate in the 1980s, when a tornado uprooted a tree in her backyard and it crashed through her family\u2019s house. Still, no one was hurt.\n\nBut she was a grandmother now and lived in a home surrounded by 26 pine trees. She had shuddered to think of the damage that could be done to her backyard, so she moved the lawn furniture and the barbecue grill into the garage. Then came the call for her to evacuate, and the harsher realities of a life-threatening storm began to settle in. Instead of thinking only about her furniture, she started thinking about her home.\n\n\u201cWe have to evacuate,\u201d she was screaming around the house, and now her grandchildren were nervous. Her youngest, 6-year-old Chyla, started to cry.\n\nThe sudden rush of nervousness forced them to take an unexpected stock of their lives and what was important. Around them, others made similar calculations. They took coolers of quickly made tuna sandwiches and their flat-screen TVs. A teenage girl stuffed notes of affirmation in paper bags and gathered her favorite pillows.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to look at a house full of stuff and think you only need a few things,\u201d Washington\u2019s daughter, Cinta Sheffield, said. \u201cWe had to humble ourselves to think about what\u2019s truly important.\u201d\n\nWashington scanned the room at the shelter.\n\nAround her was a racially mixed crowd, of all ages, all under a gym roof and looking to do little more than survive. She was glad to have seen an old friend. But she was thankful to see so many strangers living together peacefully.\n\n\u201cEverything now is Republicans and Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sometimes you need a reminder that we are just people.\u201d\n\nA man started laying a blue blanket behind her. Jerrith Davis, 23, interrupted her.\n\n\u201cYou know I survived Harvey?\u201d he said. He told her that he was living in a tent an hour outside Houston and then had to evacuate. Since then, he moved from hurricane shelter to homeless shelter to an apartment that burned down, moving farther and farther east.\n\nHe and his girlfriend of seven years had been living in a tent in Tallahassee since July, until the shelter opened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy now,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m good because I got 90 dollars in my pocket, and air in my lungs and bread in my belly and a roof over my head. I\u2019m a little nostalgic now because I remember what it was like to be able to take a shower and have food and see people smiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d Washington said.\n\nIt was about 3 p.m. The shelter had extended its hours to take in more residents, but now, opening the door was too dangerous. The rain pounded on the roof, and the television lost its cable feed. The worst had come. The wind howled and the lights on the gym scoreboard flickered. The power went off and a generator kicked in.\n\nThe wind howled against the doors. Washington\u2019s eyes widened. Her grandchildren held each other and gasped.\n\n\u201cYou hear what\u2019s going on outside,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad we are inside.\u201d\n\nAnd then she took a scoop of Cheez-Its for herself.",

  "text": "The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered an operation to lure Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia and then detain him, according to U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan.\n\nThe intelligence, described by U.S. officials familiar with it, is another piece of evidence implicating the Saudi regime in Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance last week after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials say that a Saudi security team lay in wait for the journalist and killed him.\n\nKhashoggi was a prominent critic of the Saudi government and Mohammed in particular. Several of Khashoggi\u2019s friends said that over the past four months, senior Saudi officials close to the crown prince had called Khashoggi to offer him protection, and even a high-level job working for the government, if he returned to his home country.\n\nKhashoggi, however, was skeptical of the offers. He told one friend that the Saudi government would never make good on its promises not to harm him.\n\n[Saudis are said to have lain in wait for Jamal Khashoggi]\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018Are you kidding? I don\u2019t trust them one bit,\u2019 \u201d said Khaled Saffuri, an Arab American political activist, recounting a conversation he had with Khashoggi in May, moments after Khashoggi had received a call from Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to the royal court.\n\nThe intelligence pointing to a plan to detain Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia has fueled speculation by officials and analysts in multiple countries that what transpired at the consulate was a backup plan to capture Khashoggi that may have gone wrong.\n\nA former U.S. intelligence official \u2014 who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter \u2014 noted that the details of the operation, which involved sending two teams totaling 15 men, in two private aircraft arriving and departing Turkey at different times, bore the hallmarks of a \u201crendition,\u201d in which someone is extra\u00adlegally removed from one country and deposited for interrogation in another.\n\nBut Turkish officials have concluded that whatever the intent of the operation, Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate. Investigators have not found his body, but Turkish officials have released video surveillance footage of Khashoggi entering the consulate on the afternoon of Oct. 2. There is no footage that shows him leaving, they said.\n\nThe intelligence about Saudi Arabia\u2019s earlier plans to detain Khashoggi have raised questions about whether the Trump administration should have warned the journalist that he might be in danger.\n\nIntelligence agencies have a \u201cduty to warn\u201d people who might be kidnapped, seriously injured or killed, according to a directive signed in 2015. The obligation applies regardless of whether the person is a U.S. citizen. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident.\n\n[Missing journalist\u2019s fiancee demands to know: \u2018Where is Jamal?\u2019]\n\n\u201cDuty to warn applies if harm is intended toward an individual,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official. But that duty also depends on whether the intelligence clearly indicated Khashoggi was in danger, the former official said.\n\n\u201cCapturing him, which could have been interpreted as arresting him, would not have triggered a duty-to-warn obligation,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIf something in the reported intercept indicated that violence was planned, then, yes, he should have been warned.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the warning process, declined to comment on whether Khashoggi had been contacted.\n\nAdministration officials have not commented on the intelligence reports that showed a Saudi plan to lure Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cThough I cannot comment on intelligence matters, I can say definitively the United States had no advance knowledge of [Khashoggi\u2019s] disappearance,\u201d deputy State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters Wednesday. Asked whether the U.S. government would have had a duty to warn Khashoggi if it possessed information that he was in jeopardy, Palladino declined to answer what he called a \u201chypothetical question.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear to officials with knowledge of the intelligence whether the Saudis discussed harming Khashoggi as part of the plan to detain him in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut the intelligence had been disseminated throughout the U.S. government and was contained in reports that are routinely available to people working on U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia or related issues, one U.S. official said.\n\nThe intelligence poses a political problem for the Trump administration because it implicates Mohammed, who is particularly close to Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton spoke by phone with the crown prince, but White House officials said the Saudis provided little information.\n\nTrump has grown frustrated, two officials said, after initially reacting slowly to Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. Earlier this week, he said he had no information about what had happened to the journalist.\n\nWhite House officials have begun discussing how to force Saudi Arabia to provide answers and what punishment could be meted out if the government there is found responsible.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have reacted harshly to the disappearance. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators asked Trump to impose sanctions on anyone found responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, including Saudi leaders.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), perhaps the president\u2019s closest ally in the Senate, predicted a \u201cbipartisan tsunami\u201d of action if the Saudis were involved and said that Khashoggi\u2019s death could alter the nature of relations between the two countries.\n\nKushner\u2019s relationship with Mohammed, known within national security agencies by the initials MBS, has long been the subject of suspicion by some American intelligence officials.\n\nKushner and Mohammed have had private, one-on-one phone calls that were not always set up through normal channels so the conversations could be memorialized and Kushner could be properly briefed.\n\nFor all his criticism of the Saudi regime, Khashoggi was not always opposed to Mohammed\u2019s policies. Khashoggi credited the young leader for what he saw as positive changes, including loosening Saudi cultural restrictions.\n\nKhashoggi often expressed affection for his homeland, even while saying he did not believe it was safe for him. One person in contact with the crown prince, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preserve the relationship, said Khashoggi last year asked him to give a message to Mohammed saying he needed someone like Khashoggi as an adviser.\n\nWhen he transmitted the message, this person said, the crown prince said that Khashoggi was tied to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Qatar, both Saudi adversaries, and that the arrangement would never happen.\n\nTwo other friends of Khashoggi said that at least twice he received cordial phone calls from Qahtani, the adviser to the prince, conveying friendly messages on his behalf.\n\nIn one of the calls, in September 2017, Qahtani said that Mohammed had been \u201cvery happy\u201d to see Khashoggi post a message praising the kingdom after the government announced it was lifting a driving ban on women, according to one of the friends, who was with Khashoggi at the time. The tone of the call was pleasant, but Khashoggi also told Qahtani he would praise the government when there were \u201cpositive developments. When there are bad things, I will speak up.\u201d\n\nHe spent the rest of the call advocating on behalf of several recently imprisoned critics of the regime.\n\nA friend also said that Khashoggi told him he had been approached several times by a businessman close to the Saudi ruling family. The businessman, whom Khashoggi did not name, seemed \u201ckeen\u201d to see him every time he visited Washington and told Khashoggi that he would work with the Saudi authorities to arrange his return, the friend said.\n\nKareem Fahim and Loveday Morris in Istanbul and Josh Dawsey, Karoun Demirjian, Karen DeYoung and Carol Morello in Washington contributed to this report.",

  "text": "President Trump on Wednesday appeared reluctant to consider blocking arms sales to Saudi Arabia in response to the disappearance last week of a Washington Post columnist after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Wednesday night that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered an operation to lure columnist Jamal Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia and then detain him, according to U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan.\n\nTurkish officials say that a Saudi security team lay in wait for the journalist and killed him.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News Wednesday night, Trump said he wanted to find out what happened to Khashoggi but balked when asked if he would support blocking further arms sales to Saudi Arabia, as some senators have suggested.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that would be hurting us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have jobs. We have a lot of things happening in this country. We have a country that\u2019s doing probably better economically than it\u2019s ever done before. Part of that is what we are doing with our defense systems and everybody is wanting them and frankly, I think that would be a very, very tough pill to swallow for our country.\u201d\n\nOn his first international trip as president, Trump visited Saudi Arabia and announced $110 billion in proposed arms sales. The administration also relies on Saudi support for several aspects of its Middle East agenda.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to find out really before I discuss this, I\u2019d have to find out what happened,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cAnd we are looking, and so are other people.

  "text": "A man looks at an electronic stock board of a securities firm in Tokyo on Wednesday. Stock markets across Asia dropped sharply Thursday morning in reaction to sell-off in the U.S. markets on Wednesday. (Koji Sasahara/AP)\n\nA sell-off on Wall Street infected markets in Asia and Europe on Thursday as investors from China to France reacted to fears that rising U.S. interest rates will lead to slower growth in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nChina was among the hardest hit, with indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong falling 5.2 and 3.5 percent, respectively. More than a quarter of stocks on the Shanghai exchange fell by their 10 percent daily limit, according to Bloomberg, as the Shanghai Composite Index hit lows not seen since 2014.\n\nThe tech-heavy TWSE index in Taiwan plummeted 6.3 percent, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei slid nearly 4 percent and the South Korean KOSPI index dropped 4.4 percent as foreign investors pulled out.\n\n\u201cIf this continues for three consecutive days, it will be more than just a market correction \u2014 it\u2019s more likely to be a really big sell-off,\u201d said Jackit Wong, a Hong Kong-based vice president of global market research at MUFG Bank. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping for a quiet day tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 also slumped by 1.5 percent, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 down by a similar percentage.\n\nBut, U.S. futures came off their lows Thursday morning after a report showed that consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in September after increasing 0.2 percent in August. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down by 0.4 percent, the Standard & Poor 500 futures were down by 0.2 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were relatively flat.\n\nAfter U.S. tech shares plummeted overnight, Chinese Internet giant Tencent, Asia\u2019s largest company by market capitalization and a major factor in the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index, was battered again as it fell 6.8 percent. Tencent has retreated 43 percent from its high this year and fallen out of the top 10 global companies by market value.\n\nLi Daxiao, chief economist with Yingda Securities in Shenzhen, said both Shanghai and Shenzhen shares dropped more than expected on Thursday after the shock wave from the U.S. rout hit Asia. \u201cFear is being transmitted from market to market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 800 points in trading on Wednesday, one of the worst sell-offs since February as traders rushed to sell stocks that have been driving the U.S. economy. Netflix was down more than 8 percent, Amazon was off 6 percent, and Apple and Google were both down more than 4.5 percent.\n\nThis reflected investor concern that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates and that this will slow economic growth and make borrowing more expensive for the U.S. government, as well as businesses and consumers.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. market sell-off last night spooked sentiment and rekindled memories of similar trading sessions at the beginning of this year,\u201d Medha Samant, investment director for Asian equities at Fidelity International, wrote in a note on Thursday morning, according to the Financial Times. \u201c[It is] likely that this negative sentiment could roll over to the Asian markets in the short term,\u201d she wrote.\n\n[Dow drops over 800 points as investors fear rising rates ]\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday strongly criticized the Fed for tightening rates, again signaling that he wanted interest rates to remain low.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is making a mistake. They\u2019re so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy,\u201d he told reporters while traveling in Pennsylvania Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a correction that we\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long time. But I really disagree with what the Fed is doing, okay?\u201d\n\nJitters were already running high, thanks to the trade war between China and the United States, which is showing no signs of being resolved any time soon.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with Chinese central banker Yi Gang at a World Bank conference in Indonesia on Thursday, a day after he warned China against \u201ccompetitive devaluation\u201d of its currency against the U.S. dollar as the trade war escalates.\n\nThe meeting came as Beijing \u2014 and investors worldwide \u2014 are waiting to see whether the Treasury Department labels China a currency manipulator next week in a report that could potentially set off a new round of recriminations between the two economic giants.\n\nChina\u2019s renminbi stabilized around 6.93 to the dollar as of Thursday after falling sharply earlier in the week.\n\nYi did not tell reporters how the meeting with Mnuchin went on Thursday, but told the Chinese financial magazine Caixin that China was on course to hit its GDP growth targets despite concerns about the trade war and debt levels.\n\nThe renminbi had fallen \u201csignificantly\u201d during the year and the Treasury Department is monitoring this \u201cvery carefully\u201d to make sure China wasn\u2019t manipulating its currency to gain an advantage in the trade war, Mnuchin told the Financial Times in an interview.\n\nHe said he wanted to discuss the currency with Beijing as part of the trade talks. \u201cAs we look at trade issues there is no question that we want to make sure China is not doing competitive devaluations,\u201d he told the business newspaper.\n\nSeparately, the Treasury Department issued new rules on foreign investments into American companies, strengthening its power to block them on national security grounds. China has been the main target for these rules.\n\nThis ongoing friction is likely to suppress markets for some time, analysts said.\n\n\u201cAs uncertainty continues to prevail in financial markets across the world, many investors are staying on the sidelines until more clarity emerges in U.S. Treasury and Chinese markets,\u201d said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments, according to Reuters.\n\nShih reported from Hong Kong.

  "text": "\n\nPresident Trump speaks to the press before boarding Marine One in Washington on Oct. 9. (Zach Gibson/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision to blame the Federal Reserve for Wednesday\u2019s stock market dive dramatically escalated months of public and private fuming about the central bank.\n\n\u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy,\u201d Trump told reporters before a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump appeared to be complaining that the central bank, which is run by a chairman he appointed several months ago, Jerome H. Powell, is steadily raising interest rates, a normal course of action when an economy is strengthening.\n\nTrump has been stepping up his verbal attacks on the Fed, breaking with years of tradition during which U.S. presidents and their advisers avoid commenting directly on Fed policy out of respect for the central bank\u2019s independence. Trump has indicated he is concerned that the Fed\u2019s decision to hike rates could slow economic growth, which Trump has predicted would consistently exceed 3 percent during his tenure.\n\nSo far, Trump does not appear to have taken action beyond increasingly sharp rhetoric to express his disapproval of the Fed\u2019s policies. Trump has appointed three of the current four members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, which along with regional Fed presidents sets interest rate policy.\n\nWhile Trump clearly wants the Fed to hold off from further hikes, deciphering the exact meaning of his comments is difficult.\n\n\u201cI think the Fed is making a mistake,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019re so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy. So you can say that, \u2018Well that\u2019s a lot of safety actually.\u2019 And it is a lot of safety. And it gives you a lot of margin. But I think the Fed has gone crazy.\u201d\n\nIn an otherwise highly controversial presidency, Trump has heralded the strong economy as one of his biggest achievements. On Tuesday, Trump boasted to a New York Magazine reporter that \u201cwe have the greatest economy in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, he discounted the stock market\u2019s plunge \u2014 with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 831 points. \u201cActually, it\u2019s a correction that we\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long time,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about the Fed going \u201ccrazy\u201d came in contrast to a more measured statement issued by the White House about how the economy was strong.\n\nKevin Hassett, the head of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said on Tuesday that the president is expressing his views on monetary policy but that he isn\u2019t trying to \u201cpoliticize\u201d the Fed. Hassett pointed to the six nominees Trump has made so far to serve on the Fed\u2019s board of governors, all of whom have spent extensive time in finance, banking or academia. Three have PhDs in economics, and three have law degrees. (Two await confirmation.)\n\n\u201cPart of President Trump\u2019s brand is he says what he thinks, but he respects the independence of the Fed, and that\u2019s clear from his nominations,\u201d Hassett said at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI think our nominees have been absolutely first-rate.\u201d\n\nOther economic officials pushed back at the president\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cI would not associate Jay Powell with craziness. No, no, he comes across, and members of his board, as extremely serious, solid and certainly keen to base their decisions on actual information, and decide to communicate that properly,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, at a meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Indonesia, according to CNBC.\n\nTrump has taken a number of steps this year to further juice the economy, including boosting federal spending. That comes after a big tax cut enacted last December. He has shirked any criticism of the ballooning deficit, tried to jawbone foreign leaders to lower oil prices and repeatedly attacked the central bank for raising interest rates.\n\nTrump has said he likes low interest rates in part because of his background in real estate. Higher interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow money, giving consumers or businesses pause before taking out a loan. It is often tied to higher costs of borrowing for the federal government, which can spook investors.\n\nInterest rates are rising. Some 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are now offered with an interest rate above 5 percent, significantly higher than when Trump took office.\n\nPowell and Trump haven\u2019t personally discussed the matter, the Fed chair has said, but Trump\u2019s rhetoric has alarmed some Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. They have reached out to the Fed leader to ensure that there hasn\u2019t been improper political interference.\n\nPowell has repeatedly downplayed the president\u2019s comments, saying they have no impact on the Fed\u2019s decision-making.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite removed from the political process,\u201d Powell said in an interview last week at the Atlantic Festival in Washington. \u201cWe just try to do the right thing for the medium- to long-term for the country. We don\u2019t let other things distract us.\u201d\n\nBoth Powell and the president confirmed in recent days that they have not spoken to each other about interest rates. Powell defended the Fed\u2019s plans to raise interest rates gradually in the coming months, saying it was appropriate policy in such \u201cextraordinary\u201d economic times.\n\nOne former Treasury official said that while Trump\u2019s comments are unusual, they don\u2019t appear to be changing the Fed\u2019s direction. The Fed\u2019s main interest rate, the federal funds rate, stands between 2 and 2.25 percent. The central bank has hiked interest rates three times this year and expects to do so again in December.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the Fed is continuing on the course that markets expect, to raise interest rates given the tight labor market,\u201d said Phillip Swagel, who was a top Treasury official during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem especially surprising.\u201d\n\nTrump selected Powell, a Republican who served in the George H.W. Bush administration, to lead the Fed over a number of other candidates \u2014 including several who favored even more-aggressive rate hikes. He was persuaded by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that Powell, who was already a Fed governor, would be a force for stability.\n\nBut in August, Trump said he was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with Powell, though he took his criticism much further on Wednesday when he said the Fed was \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nSome of his former advisers said they believed Trump\u2019s criticism of the central bank was warranted. Steve Moore, who was a Trump adviser during the 2016 campaign, said the central bank traditionally raised interest rates as a way to fight inflation, but he said there weren\u2019t strong signs that inflation was threatening to affect the economy.\n\n\u201cI find myself in general agreement with Trump on his criticism of the Fed, which is that raising interest rates now doesn\u2019t seem necessary,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWhere is the inflation that they are fighting? Where is it?\u201d\n\nThe stock market has risen markedly since Trump took office, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 4.8 percent to 3.7 percent. Economic growth has improved, and Republicans have taken steps to cut taxes and regulations. Economic experts are split on how long the strong economy will continue, and some investors are convinced that a number of stocks \u2014 particularly technology companies \u2014 are overpriced and were due for a slide.\n\nBut Trump loves to tout good economic news and either dismisses bad economic news or blames it on the Fed.\n\nIn a sign of how much animosity Trump holds toward the central bank, Moore said he believes Trump regrets appointing Powell to the position.\n\n\u201cI wonder today whether Trump really has some buyer\u2019s remorse with respect to selecting Powell as his Fed chairman, because that was a strange pick,\u201d Moore said.\n\nHeather Long contributed to this report.",

  "text": "A Russian rocket carrying an American and a Russian to the International Space Station failed on launch Thursday, forcing the astronaut and cosmonaut to careen back to Earth in a dramatic emergency landing.\n\nU.S. astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin parachuted to the ground safely in their capsule after a booster on the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft failed, NASA and Russia\u2019s space agency said. They were met by rescue teams in remote Kazakhstan more than 200 miles from their launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.\n\nManned space launches have been suspended pending an investigation.\n\nRussia has released photos of the men smiling while undergoing a medical checkup at Dzhezkazgan airport in Kazakhstan. They were sitting on a couch in front of a television with plates of nuts before them.\n\nThe men, who will shortly be flown back to Baikonur, were described as being in good condition despite having been exposed to higher than usual gravity forces during their descent.\n\nIt was the first time that the Soyuz \u2014 the main workhorse of manned space flight today \u2014 had failed on a launch to the 20-year-old International Space Station. The spacecraft has been the sole means of bringing humans to the space station since the end of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, but commercial providers aiming for manned spaceflight are increasingly nipping at Russia\u2019s heels.\n\n\n\nThe Soyuz MS-10 space ship carrying a new crew to the International Space Station blasts off at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday. (Dmitri Lovetsky/AP)\n\n\u201cShortly after launch, there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \u201cHague and Ovchinin are out of the capsule and are reported to be in good condition.\u201d\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, put it more bluntly in his daily conference call with journalists: \u201cThank God everyone is alive.\u201d\n\nAfter the booster failed, Ovchinin and Hague were forced to make a ballistic descent, coming back to the ground at a sharper angle than normal and causing higher gravitational forces on their bodies. But soon after the landing, U.S. and Russian officials said that rescue forces were in contact with the astronaut and cosmonaut. \ufeff\n\nAfter their rescue, Hague and Ovchinin were set to be airlifted to a space flight training center outside of Moscow. \ufeff\n\nRussian space chief Dmitry Rogozin said he was forming a state commission to investigate what caused the failure.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov, who oversees space flight, promised to share all information from the investigation with the United States and said that manned space launches would be suspended until the end of the probe, according to Russian news agencies.\n\n[Russia suggests sabotage on the International Space Station]\n\nThe rare failed launch of the Soyuz rocket is the latest and most grave problem to beset U.S.-Russian cooperation in space. Last month, an oxygen leak was found in the International Space Station that Rogozin said was made deliberately. Its cause still hasn\u2019t been determined. Russian officials have also insisted on a bigger role in a U.S.-led plan to build a space station orbiting the moon.\n\nNevertheless, officials in both countries continue to refer to space flight as a rare example of U.S.-Russian cooperation continuing despite geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe we\u2019re going to get the right answer to what caused the hole on the International Space Station and that together we\u2019ll be able to continue our strong collaboration,\u201d Bridenstine said on a visit to Moscow this week, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do is we\u2019ve got to very dispassionately allow the investigation to go forward without speculation, without rumor, without innuendo, without conspiracy.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nSpace, nuclear, polar bears: Russia and the U.S. still agree on some things\n\nNASA talking to companies about taking over the International Space Station\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

  "text": "Hurricane Michael unleashed a furious onslaught on Florida\u2019s Panhandle on Wednesday, killing two people and tearing apart buildings before taking aim at Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nMichael\u2019s 155mph winds at landfall were only 5mph short of category 5 status, making it the strongest storm to strike the United States since Hurricane Andrew ravaged southern Florida in 1992.\n\nGovernor Rick Scott, whose record on the environment has been slammed by critics, warned that a tempest of this strength had not hit the area in more than a century. Outside experts noted that human-induced climate change is increasing the regularity and intensity of monster storms.\n\n\u201cCommunities are going to see unimaginable devastation,\u201d Scott had warned.\n\nTwo deaths have been reported as a result of the hurricane. A man in Gadsden County, Florida, was killed after a tree crashed through the roof of his home and a child in Seminole County Georgia was believed to have been killed after something fell on a home he was visiting. Authorities said details about the child\u2019s death were still unclear because they had not been able to reach the home yet.\n\nNo category 4 storm has ever made landfall in the Panhandle, and Michael\u2019s vast size meant the effects would be felt along the coast from New Orleans to Tampa Bay, and inland as far as the Carolinas.\n\nLate on Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Centre said the storm had weakened over land to a tropical storm.\n\nPlay Video 1:49 Hurricane Michael pounds Florida \u2013 video report\n\nThis was a very, very powerful storm,\u201d said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service, told CNN. \u201cWhen people get out tomorrow and start making their assessments they\u2019re going to realise just how powerful a category 4 storm can be.

More than 120,000 customers were without power by late afternoon, a number certain to rise.\n\nSign up for the new US morning briefing\n\nMichael\u2019s official landfall happened just north of Mexico Beach, a small coastal town 25 miles east of Panama City and with a population of 1,000, at about 1.30pm local time. According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the storm blew in with sustained winds of 155mph and travelling at 14mph.\n\nMore than half a million people were either ordered or advised to evacuate as Michael, fuelled by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, closed in on Panama City, bringing with it a life-threatening storm surge of up to 14ft. The storm has already been blamed for 13 deaths in Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nAuthorities in Florida warned that anybody who chose not to evacuate would be on their own, with conditions already too hazardous for emergency workers to operate.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s coming out to save your life today,\u201d Scott said on CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can to tell people to evacuate and some people have unfortunately chosen not to. I\u2019m scared to death if there\u2019s any kids who didn\u2019t make that choice on their own.\u201d\n\nMore than 20 million people in five states remained under either a hurricane or tropical storm warning, while areas in North and South Carolina flooded by Hurricane Florence last month braced for even more rainfall.\n\nThe fast-moving tropical cyclone\u2019s outer bands were already causing torrential rain and flooding in Panama City Beach and Apalachicola by mid-morning on Wednesday, with the eye of the storm 50 miles away and travelling north at 14mph.\n\n\u201cThis is a truly historic and very dangerous storm,\u201d Ken Graham, the director of the NHC in Miami, said in a Wednesday morning briefing. \u201cEven 185 miles away from the centre, tropical storm force winds are still occurring. It\u2019s still a hurricane in Georgia, stretching over the Carolinas by the time it\u2019s all done.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:18 Hurricane Michael tears apart roof as it makes landfall in Florida - video\n\nGreg Brudnicki, the mayor of Panama City, said on Wednesday that many residents had ignored warnings to evacuate.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the county, 120,000 people, were told would you please leave, and as of last night we probably had only about 25,000 leave,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo the people that are staying, it\u2019s all built on years and years of complacency because we said it\u2019s gonna be bad, it\u2019s gonna be bad for years, and it never turned out to be. [But] the odds are that eventually we would get a bad one, and we\u2019ve got a bad one.\u201d\n\nScott said at a morning press conference that he had activated 3,500 national guard soldiers, 54 shelters were open across the Panhandle and that 19,000 utility workers from around the country were positioned to move in after the storm\u2019s passage to restore power.\n\n\u201cCommunities are going to see unimaginable devastation. This is the worst storm in the Panhandle in more than a century,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe time to evacuate in coastal counties has come and gone. The worst thing you could do now is leave and put yourself and your family in danger.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the storm\u2019s effects would be far-reaching and long-lasting. \u201cThe citizens of Georgia need to wake up and pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is it\u2019s going to be the worst storm south-west and central Georgia has seen in many decades.\n\n\u201cThey need to be prepared, not only in Florida but Georgia as well, to see the power off for multiple weeks.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration request for Florida, freeing federal resources and money for recovery efforts. In Georgia, more than 90 counties remained under a state of emergency and the governor, Nathan Deal, activated 1,500 national guard personnel.\n\nEarlier this week, Michael triggered flash floods and mudslides in mountain areas of western Cuba, while disaster agencies in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua reported 13 deaths as roofs collapsed and residents were carried away by swollen rivers. Six people died in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador.",

  "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/10/reporters-storm-coverage-extreme-conditions",
  "text": "In extreme weather events, viewers can count on seeing a reporter battling conditions, but it could put people at risk\n\n'This is our Super Bowl': why do reporters go into the eye of the storm?\n\nViewers tuned to CNN early on Wednesday afternoon were confronted with striking footage. As Hurricane Michael struck Florida, reporters were on hand, to convey information about the extreme conditions. They were also there to show the conditions at work. Storm reporting is one of the rare events in journalism where a reporter\u2019s physical body becomes an informational tool.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to look around to make sure nothing is coming at me,\u201d one reporter cautioned. Trees nearby were snapping, he said.\n\nOver on the Weather Channel their own rotating team of reporters sputtered into microphones and struggled to stay on foot as the winds lashed against them near the beach. One reporter said he could smell gas.\n\nMr. Wills (@mkwills87) Ok, I\u2019m all for weather reporting, but this is dangerous and insane. #hurricanemichael2018 https://t.co/RFArkIprlv\n\nBack on CNN, reporter John Berman was drenched and fighting off huge gusts of wind. He had just seen a rake flying down the street at what he estimated was 100mph. And this was all before the storm even got going.\n\n\u201cIf you have not evacuated at this point they have told you to stay in your homes and, I can tell you, I see why,\u201d Berman said.\n\nOne might ask why he hadn\u2019t taken his own advice.\n\nJuston Drake (@JustonStrmRider) @SimonStormRider getting wind measurements out in the eyewall as well. Got a 117 mph wind gust. pic.twitter.com/PVEPP8FbtB\n\nIt\u2019s a question that arises with every extreme weather event. During Hurricane Irma last year, as CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo reported from the scene, he admitted it was a bit crazy to be there. \u201cThere is a strong argument to be made that standing in a storm is not a smart thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nNo matter the conditions or the storm, weather reporters pride themselves on their bravery and their commitment to get the story. Sometimes they pay a price for it, like reporters from Good Morning America who were memorably knocked over and almost washed away by an incoming wave during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nMore recently, two journalists in North Carolina were killed when a tree fell on them while they were covering Alberto in May.\n\nOne has to wonder if it\u2019s all worth it, and, what\u2019s worse, if it\u2019s setting a dangerous example for people who might have otherwise evacuated?\n\nFor the reporters it typically is a boon. The more dangerous the conditions, the more viewers their spots pull in, and the bigger chance for career advancement and exposure. Dan Rather launched his career broadcasting a hurricane in Houston in 1961.\n\n\u201cThis is our Super Bowl,\u201d Chad Myers of CNN said during Sandy.\n\nBut it\u2019s also that pressure to be the one who captures the storm that can lead to charges of sensationalizing, as the Weather Channel\u2019s Mike Seidel found recently when viewers accused him of playing up the severity of conditions during Florence last month.\n\nTony scar. (@gourdnibler) So dramatic! Dude from the weather channel bracing for his life, as 2 dudes just stroll past. #HurricaneFlorence pic.twitter.com/8FRyM4NLbL\n\n\u201cThere is not enough action in these videos, so they are manufacturing it, leaning into 30mph winds like they are battling a category 5,\u201d Angela Fritz, the Washington Post\u2019s deputy weather editor wrote a few weeks back.\n\nThere a reason for that sort of thing. Destruction and mayhem is simply more interesting for viewers, most of whom are far from the storm themselves, to look at than a talking head simply reading off a list of facts. It\u2019s pretty clear that networks wouldn\u2019t be broadcasting so much of this stuff if there wasn\u2019t a big audience for it.\n\nJanice Bunting, the executive director of National Weather Association, a group that counts many meteorologists and weather reporters among its members said it\u2019s a topic of frequent debate in the field.\n\n\u201cThere are many different opinions on that,\u201d she said of the efficacy, and the ethics, of sending reporters out into potential danger. \u201cThere are some that are for that and some that are strongly against it. There\u2019s no yes or no answer.\u201d\n\nMany reporters take special precautions that may not be visible to viewers at home, pre-identifying safe locales to report from, arriving with enough supplies to stay self-sufficient if they get trapped for a period of time afterwards and so on.\n\n\u201cMany times what we don\u2019t see is that they are very close to shelter so they can jump in quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of them have authority where if they don\u2019t feel safe they can pull back from that story.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the argument are those who think it sets a bad example for the most crucial audience for reports like these: the people actually at risk of being affected.\n\n\u201cSome of [the critics of this type of reporting] feel that if we tell people to leave but we\u2019re still there we\u2019re talking out of both sides of our mouth,\u201d said Bunting.\n\nThat may be a necessary risk to take.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a fair question: why would you have reporters standing potentially in harm\u2019s way who are telling people to do exactly the opposite?\u201d Mark Strassmann, a veteran storm reporter for CBS News said recently to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cPart of that is that television is all about visual proof,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to persuade people that what they\u2019re seeing is real and matters to them. And if they can see me standing out there getting knocked around, it\u2019ll convince them that they should not do the same thing.\u201d",

  "text": "Elections have consequences. Denying science has consequences. And we are reaping what we sow.\n\nFloridians are staring down a very powerful Category 4 typhoon that is causing extensive damage. The high winds, heavy rains, and storm surge will cost billions of dollars.\n\nWe know that climate change is making these storms stronger. The storms feed off of warm ocean waters, and those waters are much warmer now because of climate change. I have written about the science in more detail here and here. But basically, Michael strengthened because it passed over really warm waters. Waters that were hotter because of human-caused warming.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Water ocean temperatures around Florida as Hurricane Michael evolved. Illustration: NASA EOSDIS/LANCE\n\nPredictably, the hurricane strengthened as it hit shore. As I write this, Michael is coming ashore and the pressure is still falling (low pressures in a hurricane signify a stronger storm). It appears that Michael may have the third-lowest pressure for a hurricane hitting the USA.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Infrared image of Hurricane Michael Photograph: NASA/NOAA/UW-SSEC-CIMSS, William Straka III\n\nIt is a wonder that a state like Florida, which will get pummeled by Michael, could vote for someone that denies climate change. Think of how backwards the situation is \u2013 the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has reportedly been banned from using the terms \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d. This policy reportedly went into effect when Florida elected a science denier, Rick Scott, to governor.\n\nRick Scott has been condemned by people in Florida for his backward stance. It is climate denial like his that has contributed to the suffering of residents in the state.\n\nIt\u2019s not that my colleagues haven\u2019t tried to help Governor Scott understand how his policies hurt his state. A few years ago, scientists met with him and urged him to take climate change seriously. He remained silent.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that the local media hasn\u2019t tried. Major newspapers have called upon Rick Scott to take action on climate change. But to little avail. Maybe it\u2019s because Rick Scott invests in companies that oppose climate change regulations?\n\nIt isn\u2019t that his political opponents haven\u2019t tried. Recently, Florida Democrats petitioned Rick Scott to acknowledge climate change.\n\nFortunately, while Rick Scott is now running for Senate, he\u2019s being challenged by Democrat Bill Nelson. He understands science and believes in facts. Nelson writes,\n\nClimate change is real, and we must take action to protect ourselves. Denial of this scientific reality is simply not an option, especially in Florida.\n\nRick Scott isn\u2019t the only politician from the state of Florida to reject science and diminish climate change. Senator Marco Rubio has as well.\n\nFlorida voters could put an end to this nonsense. In the current race for state Governor to succeed Scott, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis is ignoring science. He recently claimed that climate change is not an issue for states to mitigate. Say what?\n\nLet\u2019s hope Ron DeSantis loses. His opponent is Andrew Gillum, who is clear as day when he says,\n\nClimate change is real, it is impacting Floridians directly, and we will not be silenced on the matter. When I\u2019m Governor, we will not just talk about climate change -- we will put Floridians to work to make our state more energy independent and resilient and transform our state into the Solar Capital of the United States!\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Florida; there are other states getting hit by Hurricane Michael that are also led by climate deniers. For instance, Georgia will be hit by Hurricane Michael. One of the senators there, David Perdue, congratulated President Trump when he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. Georgia\u2019s other Senator, Johnny Isakson also denies the science. He too supported President Trump\u2019s reckless actions.\n\nAt the congressional district level, the denial continues. Republican Representative Barry Loudermilk was pleased when President Trump walked away from the Paris Agreement. His opponent, Flynn Broady trusts and understands science, however. His position could not be any clearer as he writes,\n\nWe have the technology and knowledge to develop and place into practice renewable energy sources, reduce carbon emissions, and move our energy needs away from carbon fuels. We owe it to the world to participate in the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol. As the leading industrial nation we must lead the effort.\n\nClimate deniers will try to say this article is gleeful about a hurricane. It is not. First of all, this hurricane and all hurricanes that hit land can cause death and destruction. I pray that people heed warnings and get out of the way. I hope people stay safe, regardless of their understanding of climate change and its effect on storms.\n\nSecond, elections have consequences and if we as a society want to create a better world and reduce climate change, we have to vote for people who understand science, who believe in facts. Climate deniers are making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change. What the hell do we expect to happen when the deniers are writing the laws?\n\nThird, for those who say \u201ctaking action on climate is too expensive\u201d, how about you add up the worldwide costs of climate inaction over the past decade. My response to you is, it\u2019s too costly to do nothing.\n\nFourth, what the hell happened to the Republican Party? The GOP formerly thought of itself as the party of intellectuals. How did you become a party where denying science is a litmus test? Where are the Republicans who actually understand climate change and care about it? If you can find one, tell me. Maybe I\u2019ll even write about them on this site.\n\nFinally, climate change is only starting. It will continue to get worse and worse. And that means storms will get worse, droughts will get deeper, flooding more severe, and the costs will go up. What we are seeing now and what we\u2019ve seen over the past decade is just a small taste to come of what the future will bring if we don\u2019t take this problem seriously.\n\nGood luck Florida and Georgia. My thoughts are with you. See you on the other side.",

  "text": "Expert says Donald Trump\u2019s effective reliance on personal attacks have caused \u2018racist and bigoted\u2019 ads to become more prevalent\n\nNegative campaign advertisements are as familiar in US elections as door-knocking and yard signs. But as the 2018 midterm election campaign pulls into its homestretch, Republican attacks in two congressional races happening 3,000 miles apart have triggered alarm bells for targeting non-white candidates in an apparent effort to highlight their \u201cotherness\u201d.\n\nThe first comes from California\u2019s 50th district, where Ammar Campa-Najjar is running as a Democrat for a seat currently occupied by the Republican Duncan Hunter. NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, a veteran political reporter and commentator called the spot \u201cmaybe the most shocking and outrageous political ad I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, in a Meet The Press Daily segment.\n\nThe ad zeroes in on Campa-Najjar\u2019s heritage \u2013 his mother is Mexican American and his father is Palestinian \u2013 calling him a \u201cPalestinian, Mexican, millennial Democrat\u201d who is \u201cworking to infiltrate Congress\u201d and a \u201csecurity risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt best it\u2019s desperate. That\u2019s putting it mildly,\u201d said Campa-Najjar, who also called the effort \u201cblatantly ignorant\u201d and \u201cunhinged from reality\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Republican Duncan Hunter\u2019s ad calls his opponent a \u2018Palestinian, Mexican, millennial Democrat\u2019 and a \u2018security risk\u2019.\n\nLast Wednesday a bipartisan group of dozens of national security veterans decried the spot as a \u201cracist and bigoted\u201d attack. \u201cThe baseless allegation that he is somehow a \u2018security threat\u2019 is an affront to our professionalism as national security experts, our American values, and our collective national dignity,\u201d the group said in an open letter.\n\nThe ad accuses Campa-Najjar of being supported by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood with no evidence, and despite the fact that Campa-Najjar is a Christian. \u201cIt\u2019s just so interesting that we live in a world where Islamophobia even extends to non-Muslims,\u201d Campa-Najjar told the Guardian.\n\nThe rest of the ad is focused on trying to tie Campa-Najjar to his grandfather, Mohammed Najjar, who was a member of the Black September Organization which plotted the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre that killed 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer.\n\nUS liberal Islamophobia is rising \u2013 and more insidious than rightwing bigotry | Khaled A Beydoun Read more\n\nCampa-Najjar was born 16 years after his grandfather was killed by Israeli forces for his role in the attacks, but Hunter\u2019s advert accused Campa-Najjar of changing his name to \u201chide his family\u2019s ties to terrorism\u201d.\n\nCampa-Najjar did recently change his name from Yassir-Najjar to Campa-Najjar, but has professionally gone by the latter for years, and said the change was to reflect the influence of his mother\u2019s family, which primarily raised him.\n\nIn a email statement to the Guardian, Hunter\u2019s spokesman, Michael Harrison, declined to provide a source for the claims about the Muslim Brotherhood or the quote from Campa-Najjar\u2019s father, but insisted that \u201cthe facts \u2026 raise national security concerns\u201d.\n\nHarrison added: \u201cany suggestion of racism or Islamophobia is completely contrary to the fact that Congressman Hunter has endorsed a Muslim candidate\u201d in a different local race.\n\nCampa-Najjar, who worked at the labor department\u2019s office of public affairs under Barack Obama, attributes the ad to desperation in a race that a recent LA times poll suggests may be tightening. While California\u2019s 50th typically leans Republican, Campa-Najjar is buoyed by general wave of Democratic support and by the fact that Hunter was recently indicted on corruption charges, which he denies.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, there\u2019s me, who was cleared by the FBI to work at White House, and there\u2019s Hunter who was indicted by the FBI,\u201d said Campa-Najjar. \u201cSo the law\u2019s on my side and not his side as of late.\u201d\n\nDavid Schweidel, a professor of marketing at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University said ads like this may increasingly be more en vogue in the post-2016 election climate largely because Trump\u2019s well-documented reliance on personal attacks proved effective enough to win the White House.\n\n\u201cWe saw pundit after pundit kind of commenting on the fact that these personal attacks weren\u2019t coming across as presidential and how \u2018it\u2019s the wrong temperament\u2019. Well, guess what, people responded to it,\u201d Schweidel said.\n\nThe white southerners who changed their views on racism Read more\n\nSchwiedel was part of a research team that looked at the effects of negative political ads in a 2018 study. They found that negative advertising persists because, \u201cas much as people say they don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s extremely effective\u201d.\n\nHe added that spots like Hunter\u2019s are generally not intended to sway undecided voters, but to inspire the base to show up at the polls. As US politics continues its long slog towards ever-increased partisanship, elections become more about turning out the base and less about converting undecideds: which could mean negative and personal attacks only become more prevalent.\n\nOn the other side of the country, attack ads on a black congressional candidate\u2019s former career as a rapper have taken on racist undertones in a district that, like California\u2019s 50th, is predominantly white. Antonio Delgado, a Harvard Law graduate and Rhodes Scholar is running as a Democrat for a seat in New York\u2019s 19th district currently held by Republican John Faso.\n\nAs a young man, Delgado released a socially conscious and political hip-hop album under the name AD the Voice in 2006.\n\nSince the album came to light, a number of Republican groups have seized on it to paint Delgado\u2019s flirtation with hip-hop as out of step with the values of the district. The Congressional Leadership Fund released an advert spot referring to Delgado as a \u201cNew York City liberal\u201d and \u201c[Nancy] Pelosi\u2019s candidate\u201d before clipping a handful of Delgado\u2019s song lyrics, overlaying dramatically loud \u201cbleep\u201d sounds over words like \u201cfuck\u201d, \u201csex\u201d and \u201cporno\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Congressional Leadership Fund attack ad on Antonio Delgado\u2019s hip-hop music as AD the Voice.\n\nThe ad also accused Delgado of \u201clacing his raps with extremist attacks on American values\u201d, playing a clip where Delgado states, factually, that more civilian lives were lost during the Iraq war than the 9/11 attacks.\n\nFaso didn\u2019t place the ads, but has not condemned them either, saying in a statement this summer that \u201cMr Delgado\u2019s lyrics paint an ugly and false picture of America.\u201d\n\nThe subtext of the ads was seemingly illuminated in a New York Times article from July when Gerald Benjamin, a friend of Faso\u2019s and director of the Benjamin Center at State University of New York at New Paltz, posed the question: \u201cIs a guy who makes a rap album the kind of guy who lives here in rural New York and reflects our lifestyle and values?\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cPeople like us, people in rural New York, we are not people who respond to this part of American culture,\u201d eventually sparking protests from students at his home campus in New Paltz. Benjamin later apologized for his remarks.\n\nDelgado has said the ads are an effort to \u201cotherize\u201d him in the eyes of the white voters he needs to win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting to people in the district that Faso believes they will buy into this sort of deception and dishonesty,\u201d said Delgado\u2019s campaign manager, Allyson Marcus, noting that a similarly themed Super Pac radio ad was even pulled by the local radio station WDST, which called the ad \u201chighly offensive\u201d and \u201cfactually distorted\u201d in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe truth is Antonio grew up in a working-class family in Schenectady, right here in upstate New York, where he learned the values of hard work and accountability. The real question is, why won\u2019t Faso condemn these divisive and deceptive ads,\u201d Marcus asked.\n\nFaso did not respond to a request for comment.",

  "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/10/democrats-denounce-deceitful-trump-claims-of-venezuela-style-socialism",
  "text": "Democrats have denounced a \u201cdeceitful\u201d opinion article by Donald Trump, which claims that the party has embraced Venezuela-style socialism.\n\nThe president wrote in USA Today, one of the country\u2019s most widely read newspapers, on Wednesday: \u201cThe truth is that the centrist Democratic party is dead. The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela.\u201d\n\nA fact check of the op-ed by the Washington Post found that \u201calmost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood\u201d. It noted drily: \u201cWe are unaware of any Democratic leader that has pointed to Venezuela as an economic model.\u201d\n\nSign up for the new US morning briefing\n\nThe article was apparently intended as a rallying cry for Trump\u2019s Republican party ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections, which will decide control of Congress. Opinion polls suggest Democrats are on course to win the House of Representatives, partly fueled by the president\u2019s personal unpopularity.\n\nTrump warned: \u201cEvery single citizen will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life. Virtually everywhere it has been tried, socialism has brought suffering, misery and decay.\u201d\n\nTurning to immigration, he wrote, without evidence: \u201cToday\u2019s Democratic party is for open-borders socialism. This radical agenda would destroy American prosperity.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s main line of attack was Democrats\u2019 plans for Medicare, a government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. He claimed that a proposal called Medicare for All \u201cwould end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives\u201d.\n\nHe went on: \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised. By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.\u201d\n\nA plan pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who challenged Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, would expand Medicare to cover almost everyone in the country, and current Medicare recipients would get improved benefits. Other Democratic plans would allow people to buy into a new government system modeled on Medicare, moving toward the goal of coverage for all \u2013 while leaving private insurance in place.\n\nTrump attacks Democrats as 'radical socialists' and scorns universal healthcare plan Read more\n\nSanders reportedly dismissed Trump\u2019s article as \u201cblatant lies\u201d. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, released images of the article with multiple crossings out and corrections scrawled in red ink.\n\nSchumer said: \u201cAll of the false and misleading words in the world can\u2019t cover up the truth: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are forcing millions of Americans to pay more for health insurance and trying to rip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s USA Today op-ed is just the latest in a long and blatant disinformation campaign designed to mislead the public while his administration engages in a purposeful sabotage of our nation\u2019s healthcare system. The American people deserve better than smears and sabotage.\u201d\n\nDemocrats contend that Republicans\u2019 attacks on Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, often nicknamed Obamacare, is hurting millions of Americans. They note a Republican lawsuit that aims to strike down protections for 130 million people with pre-existing conditions, and budget proposals that called for nearly $500bn in cuts to Medicare over 10 years.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s USA Today op-ed is the latest pronouncement of dishonesty from Republicans desperate to hide the truth about the past two years of GOP attacks on Medicare, on protections for pre-existing conditions, and on affordable healthcare.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are seeking a \u201cblue wave\u201d of support from voters this November, hoping that anti-Trump enthusiasm can inspire enough voters to win control of one or even both houses of the US Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s article had echoes of Trump\u2019s shocking 2017 inauguration speech, which employed dystopian language and a bleak appraisal of the country as blighted in a state of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d.\n\nAmong Trump\u2019s wilder claims was: \u201cIf Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America. Government-run healthcare is just the beginning. Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the US economy.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have no such plans. Topher Spiro, a senior fellow and healthcare expert at the Center of American Progress, a progressive thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cI don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s talking about there.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is in fact suing to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions, Spiro said, while the various Democratic plans would mark a positive step. \u201cFar from harming beneficiaries, these types of proposals would represent the greatest advance in care for seniors since Medicare was enacted in 1965.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen I submit an op-ed, if something I submitted were factually false, the editor would push back on such a statement. Whether there\u2019s a different standard for the president of the United States, I don\u2019t know. Clearly there are false statements in this and maybe they should have run an opposing op-ed. Some of the statements are laughably untrue.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, such as Congressman Steve Scalise, showed support with a post on Twitter without challenging the content. But many members of the public tweeted in anger at USA Today, asking for a retraction or a counter opinion piece.",

But, breaking with precedent, the airwaves in Florida\u2019s Panhandle are still jam-packed with negative ads on behalf of candidates in both parties.\n\nIs this a big deal? The ads probably won\u2019t be seen by many. After all, most Floridians in the areas affected are not likely to even have electricity. But it is another sign of crumbling political norms.\n\nRepublicans rely on gas tax to save California seats\n\nCalifornia has become one of the central battlegrounds of the midterms. There are seven Republican-held seats in the state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. As a result, the GOP is doing everything it can to play defense.\n\nScrap a gas tax? One effort is a referendum on a gas tax increase passed last year. The campaign to overturn the 12-cent-per-gallon increase in the tax is a key part of a Republican strategy to boost turnout by conservatives in November.\n\nWill it work? It certainly will make a difference. Ballot measures have long been used by both parties to juice turnout from their base. Most infamously, in 2004, a series of statewide initiatives to ban gay marriage may have provided the decisive margin for Republicans in a number of states as it turned out evangelicals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump at the White House Tuesday. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nKamala Harris goes to South Carolina\n\nThe California senator will campaign in South Carolina next week, the home of the \u201cFirst in the South\u201d presidential primary. It\u2019s a key step forward for a potential 2020 candidate who has still yet to appear in Iowa or New Hampshire. (Although she will be in Iowa before election day.)\n\nShe\u2019s running? This is another strong indicator that she just might be. Although Democrats have competitive candidates running for governor and for a congressional seat in the Palmetto State, neither of those races are in or even adjacent to the top tier.\n\nWhy is South Carolina important? The Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina is majority African American. With black voters making up a key demographic within the Democratic party, South Carolina\u2019s presidential primary is a key test of whether Democratic candidates can appeal to African Americans.\n\nPoll of the day\n\nIn a poll from NBC News and Marist College, Democrat Jacky Rosen is trailing the incumbent Republican Dean Heller in Nevada\u2019s Senate race. The poll has Rosen, a first-time congresswoman, losing by a narrow 46%-44% margin in what Democrats consider their best Senate pickup opportunity in the midterms.\n\nHow bad is this for Democrats? It\u2019s not good. Rosen had a narrow lead in previous polls but this is the first one since the congressional testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States supreme court. However, it\u2019s one poll in a state that is notoriously difficult to poll.\n\nSo who wins in November? It\u2019s still going to be close. Heller is the only Republican up for re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won and is still vulnerable as a result. However, he first won election to the Senate in 2012 when Barack Obama won the state handily and Clinton\u2019s success in the Silver State in 2016 should not be considered an omen of a \u201cblue wave\u201d in 2018.\n\nAd of the day\n\nDemocrats are aggressively trying to tie Republican congresswoman Mimi Walters to Donald Trump in a new ad. However, they may simply aggressively annoy quite a few southern Californians who watch it. The advertisement has an off-key performance of \u201c99 bottles of beer on the wall\u201d to amplify its message that Walters votes with Trump 99% of the time.\n\nIs it effective? Clinton won the suburban southern California district by a 49%-44% in 2016. It\u2019s an area of Orange county that is traditionally Republican but has been deeply alienated by Trump and is now a central battleground in the midterms.\n\nWill it work? It\u2019s certainly memorable and is likely to be a rather annoying earworm if you watch it enough times (which you shouldn\u2019t).",

Republicans, meanwhile, view the looming contest as another clash of the culture wars that have dominated Trump\u2019s first term, rallying behind the president\u2019s \u201cus v them\u201d clarion call.\n\nThe outcome will determine which party controls Congress and has the potential to change the course of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201c2018 appears to be an election where we\u2019re going to have higher than typical midterm turnout,\u201d said Michael McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, whose research has focused on voter turnout.\n\n\u201cWhy? Its name is Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nSign up for the new US morning briefing\n\nNoting that both parties were seeing higher levels of engagement, McDonald said midterms were typically a referendum on the president and his party.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is part of the story of what\u2019s going on. The policies that the Republicans have enacted are also part of that story.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey, 60% of Americans said their vote would be an expression of opposition to or support of the president. Far more respondents, by a 14-point margin, said they viewed their midterm vote as being \u201cagainst\u201d Trump.\n\nDemocrats need to flip 24 Republican seats to take back the majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2010. The Senate map is more favorable to Republicans, who are hoping to expand on a narrow 51-49 seat majority by toppling several red-state Democratic incumbents.\n\nSeveral states signaled they were seeing record numbers of voters registering to cast their ballots in November.\n\nThis month, California\u2019s secretary of state said 19 million residents had registered to vote, an increase of about 1.5 million compared with the 2014 midterms. A similar trend was observed in Texas, where state officials cited an 11% rise in registered voters from the previous midterms.\n\nCalifornia is home to a handful of key battleground races for the House, while Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quest to unseat Republican Ted Cruz in Texas is among the most closely watched Senate races.\n\nA record number of people also registered to vote last month on the national voter registration day. According to the organization Nonprofit Vote, more than 800,000 people registered on the holiday, which was created in 2012. In 2014, just 154,500 people registered to vote.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, how many of those who registered will show up at the polls.\n\nMcDonald said there was not yet enough data from which to draw any sweeping conclusions, and that there had been little evidence to suggest the kind of turnout in midterms that the country typically sees when the White House is in play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going to be well short of a presidential election. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s going to revolutionize turnout,\u201d he said.\n\nPoliticians, celebrities and other public figures have nonetheless escalated their calls on voters to register as deadlines come to a close in states that could prove influential in November, underscoring the importance of the moment.\n\nTrump, who has ramped up his campaign appearances on behalf of Republican candidates, implored his supporters on Tuesday to register to vote in an all-caps tweet.\n\nCelebrities have joined the chorus. Rihanna shared voter registration information across her social media platforms to tens of millions of followers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what responsibilities you have today. There\u2019s no greater responsibility than being in control of your future and it starts NOW!!\u201d the musician wrote.\n\nHer appeal came two days after Taylor Swift broke her silence on politics to endorse two Democratic candidates in Tennessee. Swift\u2019s rare political statement led to a spike in voter registrations that, according to Vote.org, topped 65,000 in just 24 hours.\n\nRaven Brooks, the COO of Vote.org, said celebrities were particularly persuasive in motivating young voters to the polls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing an incredible spike in voter registration just in terms of numbers,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely being driven by younger voters.\u201d\n\nNRA debuts new rating for Florida candidates backed by gun control group Read more\n\nBrooks said the vast majority of the registrations his group had seen were by voters aged 18 to 24, followed by those aged 25 to 29.\n\n\u201cThat is completely inverted from what we saw at the same time in 2016,\u201d he said, noting in the previous election year the registration numbers were dominated by voters aged 30 to 39 and older.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a lot of people into the process that are new voters, they\u2019re young voters,\u201d he said. \u201cThat changes, over time, what our political leaders look like.\u201d",

If you\u2019d like to receive this briefing by email, sign up here.\n\nSign up for the US morning briefing\n\nTop story: Two dead in the fiercest US storm since 1992\n\nHurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday with winds of up to 155mph, the most powerful storm in the region\u2019s history and the strongest to strike the US since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Two people died in Florida as Michael, since downgraded to a tropical storm, moved inland towards Georgia and the Carolinas, parts of which are still recovering from September\u2019s Hurricane Florence.\n\n- Storm hits. Hurricane Michael made landfall at about 1.30pm on Wednesday just north of Mexico Beach, Florida, a small coastal town 25 miles east of Panama City.\n\n- Worth the risk? Weather reporters pride themselves on covering major storms, sometimes endangering their own lives to get the story. Is it worth the risk?\n\nThe Mooch returns to trash his rivals again in new book\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scaramucci lasted 10 days in the White House. Photograph: Pablo Mart\u00ednez Monsiv\u00e1is/AP\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the Wall Street hedge-funder who held the role of White House communications director for all of 10 days in 2017, has written a new tome: Trump, the Blue Collar President. The Guardian obtained a copy of the book, due to be published on 23 October, in which \u201cThe Mooch\u201d praises Trump\u2019s \u201cauthenticity\u201d but slams former rivals including Steve Bannon (\u201cmegalomaniacal\u201d, \u201cborderline delusional\u201d), John Kelly (\u201cineffective\u201d) and Reince Priebus (a \u201crodent\u201d).\n\n- Kanye, West Wing. Lauded by Scaramucci for his understanding of the common man. Trump is due to welcome Kanye West to the White House for lunch on Thursday.\n\n\u2018Racist and bigoted\u2019: GOP attack ads target non-white candidates\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ammar Campa-Najjar, whose mother is Mexican American and whose father is Palestinian, is running for Congress in California. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nRepublican attack ads in two hotly contested midterm congressional races have been criticised for emphasising the \u201cotherness\u201d of the non-white Democratic candidates. In California\u2019s 50th district, for instance, where Ammar Campa-Najjar is running to unseat the Republican incumbent, Duncan Hunter, a GOP ad described the Democrat \u2013 whose father is Palestinian \u2013 as a \u201csecurity risk\u201d. A bipartisan group of national security veterans published an open letter calling the ad \u201cracist and bigoted\u201d.\n\n- Extremist attack. In New York\u2019s 19th district, the GOP unearthed an old rap track recorded by Antonio Delgado \u2013 a Harvard Law graduate and Rhodes Scholar \u2013 calling it an \u201cextremist [attack] on American values\u201d.\n\n- Trump effect. The marketing professor David Schweidel said such ads may have become more prevalent since Donald Trump repeatedly indulged in personal attacks on his way to winning the White House in 2016.\n\nStephen Hawking\u2019s final scientific paper is released\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The late Stephen Hawking, who died in March. Photograph: Bruno Vincent/Getty Images\n\nStephen Hawking\u2019s final scientific paper, completed in the days before his death in March, has been posted online by the scientist\u2019s colleagues at Harvard and Cambridge universities. The paper, Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair, tackles what theoretical physicists call \u201cthe information paradox\u201d: the question of what happens to the information held by an object after it falls into a black hole.\n\n- Universal questions. Malcolm Perry, a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge and Hawking\u2019s co-author on the paper, explains how their latest work improves our understanding of the universe.\n\nCrib sheet\n\n- Contrary to official US policy, the Trump campaign argued in a legal filing that WikiLeaks could not be held liable for publishing emails stolen by Russian hackers during the 2016 election.\n\n- World stock markets plunged on Thursday morning, propelled in part by Donald Trump, who told reporters at a rally in Pennsylvania that the Fed\u2019s recent US interest rate hikes were \u201ccrazy\u201d.\n\n- A New York limo driver with joint US-Egyptian citizenship was \u201cdisappeared\u201d for four months, tortured and sexually assaulted by Egyptian security forces, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\n- A California judge has granted a new trial to Monsanto, after a jury ruled against the agrochemical corporation in the case of a school groundskeeper who says his terminal cancer was caused by chemicals in its Roundup weedkiller.\n\nMust-reads\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Good Company: Patti Lupone.

As she prepares to star in a new production of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Company, LuPone spoke to Hadley Freeman.\n\nCould populism actually be good for democracy?\n\nTo the horror of liberals, Brazil looks set to be the next major nation to elect a far-right populist. But history shows us such uprisings at the ballot box may, in fact, be the very thing to keep democracy healthy in the long term, as James Miller explains.\n\nHow climate change threatens a California surfing Mecca\n\nOliver Milman reports from Santa Cruz, the celebrated California surf town that is steadily crumbling into the Pacific, a victim of rising sea levels and increasingly brutal weather.\n\nHaruki Murakami: \u2018Writers don\u2019t have to be intelligent\u2019\n\nHaruki Murakami\u2019s novels took off in Russia as the Soviet Union collapsed, in Berlin as the wall came down. The celebrated Japanese novelist tells Oliver Burkeman why his books appeal most amid political chaos.\n\nOpinion\n\nAnother financial crash is on the horizon, writes Larry Elliot. And when it finally arrives, exacerbated by the effects of global climate change, it could be even worse than 1929.\n\nThe message is clear for those willing to hear it: get ready for a time when economic failure combines with ecological breakdown to create the perfect storm.\n\nSport\n\nAs part of the Next Generation 2018 series, the Guardian has picked 60 of the most promising talents in world football from the crop born in 2001, a group that includes Real Madrid\u2019s next Brazilian star and the son of France\u2019s most-capped player.\n\nVladimir Putin has met with the UFC star Khabib Nurmagomedov to congratulate him on his victory over Conor McGregor. Putin sympathised with Nurmagomedov over his actions after the fight, when he leapt out of the ring to attack one of his opponent\u2019s trainers.\n\nSign up\n\nThe US morning briefing is delivered by email every weekday.

  "text": "The ex-White House communications director, who served for just 10 days, says his former boss understands \u2018the common man\u2019\n\nIn a new book, short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci escalates multiple long-running battles with erstwhile Washington colleagues while chiseling a heroic likeness of Donald Trump with inside tales of the president\u2019s secret wisdom and wit.\n\nA copy of the book, Trump, the Blue-Collar President, to be published on 23 October, was obtained by the Guardian.\n\nThe list of characters Scaramucci trashes anew includes current chief of staff John Kelly, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nKelly is \u201cineffective\u201d and suffers from \u201cpersonal insecurity\u201d, Scaramucci writes; Priebus is a rat; and Bannon is a hypocrite and a weirdo.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is an unheralded maestro who coaxes analysis and insights from various advisers which he then renders as coherent policy.\n\n\u201cI know him well, and I believe he has an intellect that is uniquely suited to the presidency,\u201d Scaramucci writes of Trump. \u201cHe never let anyone know he was gathering information to make policy out of it\u2026 So he made it seem like he was chatting, talking economics and trade policy the way you\u2019d talk about the New York Mets. Then he synthesized all the responses into one position, letting in the good bits and keeping out the bad.\u201d\n\nYou're fired! I quit! The major Trump administration departures Read more\n\nSince leaving the White House in 2017, Scaramucci, a New York native and Harvard law school graduate widely known as \u201cthe Mooch\u201d, has resumed work on Wall Street, appeared frequently on television and traveled the country staging politics-themed town halls.\n\nDespite his background as a hedge-funder, Scaramucci describes himself as a street-hustling \u201cGuido\u201d well-positioned to judge the blue-collar appeal of Trump, who was a millionaire by age eight thanks to an inheritance that ultimately amounted to nine figures, the New York Times recently reported. Trump simply understands the common man and delivers an \u201cauthenticity\u201d other politicians lack, Scaramucci says.\n\nScaramucci served just 10 days as communications director before being fired by a newly installed Kelly after Scaramucci gave a blunt late-night phone interview to the New Yorker in which he said, among other things, \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\u201d\n\nIn his book, Scaramucci avoids repeating that charge, but he keeps up his campaign against Bannon, whom he calls \u201cmegalomaniacal\u201d and \u201cone of the biggest hypocrites in a town lousy with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was as though he was borderline delusional, and I\u2019m not saying that in the heat of some late-night phone call,\u201d Scaramucci writes of Bannon. \u201cHis was a power-dream fantasy.\u201d\n\nScaramucci\u2019s beef with Kelly, whom he has previously called \u201cGeneral Jackass,\u201d is less personal but plenty alive. When he arrived at the White House in July 2017, the retired four-star Marine general was charged with cleaning house, and one of his first acts was to deep-six Scaramucci. Scaramucci has apparently not forgotten.\n\n\u201cHis personal insecurity has proven to be a poor match with the self-confident, gregarious president,\u201d Scaramucci writes of Kelly, who he says is \u201cincapable of recruiting a compatible staff to work with him\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the president will choose someone as his next chief who actually likes him.\u201d\n\nScaramucci has known Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman, longer, since they crossed paths during the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign. They had been friendly, Scaramucci writes \u2013 until Priebus decided to join forces with Bannon to push Scaramucci out of the White House.\n\n\u201cReince sold himself out,\u201d Scaramucci writes. \u201cHe joined the rodent family in order to survive.\u201d\n\nThe tension among the three men produces one of the most memorable scenes in the book, in which Scaramucci describes Bannon and Priebus accompanying him to the Oval Office in an effort to stop his elevation as communications director.\n\n\u201cThe president sat behind the Resolute desk, his jaw set and his eyes a steely blue,\u201d Scaramucci recalls. \u201c[Trump] then looked back at Reince. The president\u2019s expression was one of absolute disgust.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci: 'I\u2019m in the game for a fight. I love the fight' Read more\n\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want any of your taint on Anthony\u2019, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was war. Full on.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the intra-West-Wing war, none of the combatants was left standing and all three men left the White House. But lest there were any doubt, Scaramucci is proud to be an emeritus member of Team Trump, branding himself in his book as \u201cFired But Loyal.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom my current vantage point, I might be in a better place to help the president than when I was on the inside,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe way I look at it, I\u2019m still in the orbit, but far enough away to have an objective view.\u201d",

  "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/10/wikileaks-hacked-emails-trump-campaign-robert-mueller",
  "text": "The Trump campaign argued in a legal filing that Wikileaks could not be held liable for publishing emails that were stolen by Russian hackers ahead of the 2016 US election because the website was simply serving as a passive publishing platform on behalf of a third party, in the same way as Google or Facebook.\n\nQuestions about Wikileaks\u2019 publication of thousands of hacked emails, which it allegedly obtained following a plot by Russian military intelligence to steal the emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic party, are at the heart of Robert Mueller\u2019s criminal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nThe campaign also said in a legal filing that any alleged agreement between the Trump campaign and Wikileaks to publish the emails could not have been a \u201cconspiracy\u201d because Wikileaks\u2019 decision to release the stolen emails was not an illegal act. The court filing was written in response to a civil lawsuit brought against the Trump campaign by two of Hillary Clinton\u2019s donors and a former employee of the Democratic party.\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s surprising defence of Wikileaks marks a stark departure from official US policy, which has condemned the website for frequently targeting the US government and for publishing thousands of classified documents about covert policies.\n\n'Protecting our democracy': DNC chair defends suit against Trump and Russia Read more\n\nMike Pompeo, the former CIA director who now serves as Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state, has called Wikileaks a \u201chostile non-state intelligence service\u201d that put US lives at risk, damaged national security and was \u201cabetted by state actors like Russia\u201d.\n\nAnalysts say the legal filing is also significant because it hints at how officials in the Trump White House or individuals who served on the campaign may eventually seek to defend themselves against any criminal charges alleging that they conspired with Wikileaks to release the emails.\n\nThe legal arguments suggest the Trump White House would argue Wikileaks was not criminally liable for the release of the emails and that it therefore would not be a criminal conspiracy to work with the website on their release.\n\nThe filing also makes the case that, under the campaign\u2019s first amendment right to free speech, it had the right to publish information \u2013 even if it was stolen \u2013 as long as it did not participate in the theft of the emails. The hacked materials were a matter of \u201csignificant public concern\u201d, the filing said.\n\nThe 32-page legal filing, which argued that the civil case against the Trump campaign had no merit, was written by lawyers at the Jones Day law firm, where Don McGahn, the White House counsel, previously worked.\n\nThe Trump campaign is under close scrutiny by Mueller, but the legal filing was a response to a civil complaint that was filed by the two Clinton donors and a former employee of the Democratic National Committee whose emails were hacked.\n\nIn presenting its legal defence, the Trump campaign lawyers turned to a section of the Communications Decency Act, a law that in effect gives legal immunity to big internet companies \u2013 like Facebook, YouTube and Google \u2013 and protects them from being sued for materials that are published on their platforms. The law essentially calls those companies passive publishers, and the Trump campaign is arguing Wikileaks ought to be offered the same legal protection.\n\n\u201cA website that provides a forum where \u2018third parties can post information\u2019 is not liable for the third party\u2019s posted information\u2026 Since Wikileaks provided a forum for a third party (the unnamed \u2018Russian actors\u2019) to publish content developed by that third party (the hacked emails), it cannot be held liable for the publication,\u201d the filing said.\n\nDemocratic party sues Russia, WikiLeaks and Trump campaign over election disruption Read more\n\nMueller\u2019s recent indictment of 12 members of the Russian intelligence unit that allegedly stole the hacked materials paints a different picture of Wikileaks\u2019 role in the publication of the emails, as does a 2017 intelligence assessment of the hack. Mueller\u2019s indictment stated that the Russian \u201cconspirators\u201d discussed the release of the stolen documents with a group it refers to as \u201cOrganization 1\u201d \u2013 widely believed to be Wikileaks \u2013 in order to \u201cheighten their impact\u201d on the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nRyan Goodman, the former special counsel of the Pentagon and co-editor of the Just Security blog, said Mueller\u2019s recent indictment indicated that Wikileaks had played an \u201cactive role\u201d in producing the content and the timing of the content\u2019s disclosure of stolen emails and documents.\n\n\u201cThat fact, which was not known before, could significantly change the calculus as to whether they could claim immunity under the Communications Decency Act [Section 203] because they are no longer playing a passive role,\u201d he said.",

The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the biggest shares in the region, tumbled by 1.6% to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. The MSCI world stock index hit an eight-month low.\n\nThe sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction \u2013 the blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903.

The Dow and the S&P 500 each lost more than 3% \u2013 the worst drop in eight months, led by sharp declines in technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled by just over 4%.\n\nCraig Erlam of the trading firm Oanda said: \u201cEuropean stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields.\u201d\n\nDespite a booming US economy, low inflation and low unemployment, investors are concerned about rising US interest rates. Expectations of further rate rises have pushed up bond yields, drawing money out of the stock market.\n\nThe yield on the two-year US government bond hit its highest level since 2008 on Wednesday, while the 10-year yield, which is used to price mortgages, auto loans and other debt, reached a seven-year high the previous day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a bloodbath,\u201d said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has complained for weeks that the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates too quickly and that it risks choking off economic growth.\n\nTrump has boasted about the rise of US stock markets to record highs under his presidency and played down Wednesday\u2019s sell-off, describing it as a long-awaited \u201ccorrection\u201d.\n\n\u201cActually it\u2019s a correction that we\u2019ve been waiting for a long time but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,\u201d Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy,\u201d Trump said.\n\nInvestors have also become concerned that escalating tensions between the US and China over trade will lead to a slowdown in global demand.\n\nCommSec (@CommSec) The Australian market has been caught up in the global sell-off amid worries that rising US long-term interest rates will impact economic growth.

China\u2019s central bank cut the reserve requirement for banks on Sunday in order to pump around $100bn into the economy.\n\nThe Chinese yuan slipped against the dollar again on Thursday as Beijing tries to mitigate the impact of US tariffs. However, it was the only currency across the region that was feeling the pressure from higher bond yields as the Australian dollar slipped under US71c.\n\n\u201cThe yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche\u2019s global head of G10 FX strategy in Sydney. \u201cFurther weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital, and a loss of control.\u201d\n\nIn commodities, oil also took a battering, with the price of Brent crude falling 2% to $81.51 a barrel, while US crude dropped 1.7% to $71.93.\n\nIn Australian trade, tech, financial and resources stocks were all under the pump. Energy and consumer staples were also more than 2% lower and only gold miners offered any relief as investors sought a safe haven. The big four banks all fell, with ANZ leading the quartet down.",

A 26-minute polemic posted on YouTube called Venezuela: An Alert for Brazil.\n\nThe plot? A dastardly communist conspiracy to seize control of Latin America\u2019s largest democracy and turn it into a Bolivarian inferno of savagery and destitution.\n\n\u201cIS BRAZIL FREE FROM BECOMING THE VENEZUELA OF TOMORROW?\u201d the far-right populist tweeted alongside a link to his politically charged flick, produced in partnership with his politician son Eduardo Bolsonaro.\n\nJair Bolsonaro\u2019s push for power has been turbocharged by a duo of contemporary Brazilian bugbears: fear of an intensifying murder crisis that last year claimed nearly 64,000 lives and fury at jaw-dropping levels of corruption.\n\nBut a third, increasingly dominant theme has also emerged in his fight for the presidency: the crisis in Venezuela and Bolsonaro\u2019s oft-repeated allegation that his Workers\u2019 party (PT) opponent, Fernando Haddad, will inflict similar pain on Brazil.\n\nI hope my fellow Brazilians see through Bolsonaro before it\u2019s too late | Luiza Sauma Read more\n\nHardly an interview or public declaration now goes by without Bolsonaro name-dropping Brazil\u2019s crisis-stricken South American neighbour.\n\nIn his first comments since Sunday\u2019s emphatic first-round win, Bolsonaro warned only two paths were now available to Brazilian voters \u2013 his path of prosperity, freedom and godliness or Haddad\u2019s: \u201cThe path of Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe next morning another of Bolsonaro\u2019s sons, Carlos, echoed the message on Instagram. \u201cTogether let\u2019s stop Brazil becoming a Cuba or a Venezuela,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHarold Trinkunas, a Stanford University Latin America expert, said Venezuela\u2019s meltdown, which has caused the most severe migration crisis in modern Latin American history, had become \u201ca really powerful tool for Bolsonaro to attack the PT and Haddad\u201d.\n\nSimilar claims were used against Colombia\u2019s defeated leftwing presidential hopeful Gustavo Petro, who was routinely \u2013 and inaccurately \u2013 described as an agent of \u201ccastrochavismo\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A supporter of Jair Bolsonaroshows a T-shirt depicting him in front of the Bolsonaro\u2019s condominium in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Sergio Moraes/Reuters\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s charge was fanciful, said Trinkunas. \u201cWhen the PT was in government, under Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, Brazil certainly didn\u2019t take the path that Venezuela took.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, I think for Brazilians the threat Bolsonaro poses to institutions is a little more Ch\u00e1vez-like than that posed by Haddad. Bolsonaro [who has repeatedly praised dictatorships] is the one who has made anti-institutional statements during his career, rather than Haddad.\u201d\n\nThe former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a well-known critic of the PT and Lula, has also called Bolsonaro\u2019s claims \u201can exaggeration\u201d.\n\nBut Bolsonaro\u2019s vast fanbase is absolutely convinced by it, with supporters up and down the country parroting theories of the supposed red peril posed by the PT.\n\n\u201cThey want to transform our flag into a red flag \u2013 the flag of communism!\u201d declared Cleuzenir Barbosa, a member of Bolsonaro\u2019s party in Minas Gerais state, warning that moral decay and \u201csevere communism\u201d lurked behind the PT\u2019s \u201cbeautiful and serene words\u201d. \u201cWorse, I would say, than that of Venezuela or Fidel Castro!\u201d\n\nPaulo Henrique Villas Boas, a Pernambuco-based bolsonarista, agreed: \u201cThey support dictators like Fidel Castro! Like Maduro! Hugo Ch\u00e1vez! Dictatorships in Africa! Hamas!\u201d\n\nCritics say the PT \u2013 which enjoyed close ties to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s government under Lula \u2013 has failed to neutralize such attacks by sufficiently distancing itself from the increasingly authoritarian regime of his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Presidents Hugo Chavez, left, of Venezuela and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, pictured together in 2007. Photograph: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSome of those seen as being furthest to the party\u2019s left have even publicly backed Maduro. Last year \u2013 in what one commentator denounced as \u201cthe most shameful page in the PT\u2019s history\u201d \u2013 the party president, Gleisi Hoffmann, voiced support for his socialist party as it resisted \u201ca violent rightwing offensive\u201d.\n\nMaur\u00edcio Santoro, an international relations expert from Rio de Janeiro\u2019s State University, called the PT\u2019s relutance to question Maduro \u201ca big mistake\u201d that brought Haddad \u201ca series of problems and no benefits\u201d.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Guardian, Haddad conceded that Venezuela\u2019s \u201cdemocratic environment\u201d had been \u201ccompromised\u201d but stopped short of criticising Maduro.\n\n'Totally divided': how Venezuela's crisis split the Latin American left Read more\n\nOn Wednesday, he again dodged a question about whether he considered Venezuela a democracy or a dictatorship, admitting only that its situation was \u201cdramatic\u201d.\n\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s role is that of a leader in this continent \u2026 We don\u2019t need to take sides \u2026 We don\u2019t need to declare war on any of our neighbours,\u201d Haddad told foreign correspondents in S\u00e3o Paulo, pointing to the PT\u2019s commitment to \u201cthe principle of non-intervention\u201d.\n\n\u201c[The answer] isn\u2019t more bullets, more military bases, more war \u2026 The continent needs more cooperation.\u201d\n\nCelso Amorim, Brazil\u2019s foreign minister under Lula, was similarly cautious. \u201cVenezuela is in a complex situation, it has a lot of inequality, it might have committed mistakes,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\nBut Amorim called claims his party wanted Brazil to follow Caracas an invention of the \u201cradical right\u201d: \u201cTo imagine that Brazil will be influenced by Venezuela is a fantasy \u2026 It is a myth, it is a lie.\u201d\n\nM\u00f4nica Valente, the PT\u2019s international relations secretary, accused Bolsonaro of trying to polarize the election by \u201ccaricaturing\u201d Haddad\u2019s campaign: \u201cYou can\u2019t characterise the candidacy of Fernando Haddad as extreme left.\u201d\n\nThat, though, is exactly what Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign is doing \u2013 with energy and with success.\n\nBetween them, Eduardo and Jair Bolsonaro have sent more than 50 Venezuela-themed tweets this year, most flagging up the supposed socialist threat to Brazil.\n\nHis father returned to the theme on Tuesday morning in his latest Bolivarian-themed broadcast, accusing the Brazilian leftist of being \u201cin love with Venezuela\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s us against them \u2026 It\u2019s Brazil against the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes,\u201d Bolsonaro declared.\n\nThe tactic appears to be catching on: on Wednesday, another rightwing populist warned of the \u201csuffering, misery and decay\u201d that leftwingers planned to inflict.\n\nIn a rare editorial for USA Today, Donald Trump wrote that \u201cthe new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela\u201d. The assertion drew scorn from political opponents and Latin America experts, with a Washington Post fact check noting drily: \u201cWe are unaware of any Democratic leader that has pointed to Venezuela as an economic model.\u201d",

  "text": "Saudi special forces officers, intelligence officials, national guards and a forensics expert were allegedly among a 15-person team tied to the disappearance in Istanbul of the high-profile dissident Jamal Khashoggi, it has been reported by Turkish pro-government newspapers.\n\nThe details of the alleged hit squad were listed on flight manifests leaked to Turkish media. Social media profiles of some of the alleged suspects link them to elite sections of the Saudi security apparatus.\n\nMeanwhile, investigators are turning their focus towards the underground garage of the Saudi consul general\u2019s home, where the cars thought to have carried Khashoggi are believed to have to have been driven immediately after they left the nearby consulate.\n\nProfile Jamal Khashoggi Show Hide Jamal Khashoggi is one of the Arab world\u2019s most prominent journalists and commentators. He is an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia who has dared to defy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler. While living in Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi was told to stop writing or posting on Twitter, where he has more than 1.6 million followers. He moved to the US more than a year ago, where he continued to comment on his country both in print and on television. He wrote columns for the Washington Post and the Guardian.\n\nHis message struck a nuanced tone in the US, where he tried to acknowledge the reforms undertaken by Bin Salman while also highlighting the flaws. Khashoggi previously had close links with the Saudi royal family, including having served as a media aide to Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency. He is also a former editor of the Saudi newspaper al-Watan and had worked with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a grandson of the first Saudi king who was detained last year as part of what the authorities said was an anti-corruption campaign. Photograph: Virginia Mayo/AP\n\nInvestigators also disclosed on Wednesday that they were focusing on an Apple watch that Khashoggi was wearing that was connected to an iPhone he had left with his fiancee outside the consulate. \u201cWe have determined that it was on him when he walked into the consulate,\u201d a security official told Reuters. Investigators are seeking to determine what information the watch had transmitted.\n\nDonald Trump said that the US was \u201cdemanding\u201d answers from the Saudi government and working closely with Turkey to find out what happened to the missing dissident.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious situation for us and for this White House,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cI want to see what happens and we\u2019re working very closely with Turkey and I think we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nThe US president also said that he had invited Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, to the White House.\n\nMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, John Bolton, the national security adviser, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, all spoke to the Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, to request further information about the missing journalist, according to the White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.\n\nTwenty-two US senators signed a letter to Trump on Wednesday triggering an investigation and determination of whether human rights sanctions should be imposed over Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.\n\nIn the letter, the senators said they had triggered a provision of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act requiring the president to determine whether a foreign person is responsible for a gross human rights violation.\n\nTurkish officials remain convinced that Khashoggi was killed by the alleged hit squad inside the consulate building \u2013 a view partly formed by security footage, much of which has not been released. But, unlike the roads outside the diplomatic mission, they have no camera coverage of the consul general\u2019s residence or the garage beneath it, and say the cars and their occupants remained out of sight for several hours before continuing to Atat\u00fcrk airport.\n\nDetails of the Saudi citizens who travelled to Istanbul were released amid a claim that they had brought with them a bone saw to dismember Khashoggi. \u201cIt was like Pulp Fiction,\u201d a Turkish official told the New York Times. Suggestions that Khashoggi was killed and his body then mutilated have gained wide circulation in the week since he vanished, and Turkish officials continue to insist he met a brutal fate when he stepped through the doors of the diplomatic mission.\n\nThe alleged involvement of a forensics expert adds weight to the suspicions. The passenger manifest, obtained by the pro-government Daily Sabah newspaper, also lists a senior intelligence officer and two Saudi air force officers.\n\nThe Saudi team is said to have arrived at Atat\u00fcrk airport on Tuesday last week on two planes, one of which landed in the pre-dawn hours and the second in the early afternoon. Airport security officials now say they checked all bags that the Saudi teams took with them to the airport and say there were nothing suspicious in any of the items loaded on to the jets for their return journeys to Riyadh.\n\nOfficials also said they had become aware that Khashoggi may have been kidnapped before the second plane had departed, and monitored seven Saudis in a waiting room as they checked their luggage for a second time. When nothing unusual was discovered, the plane was allowed to leave.\n\nTurkish media have broadcast CCTV footage that shows the alleged Saudi team arriving and leaving Istanbul airport, as well as vehicles approaching and leaving the consulate.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the Washington Post cited US intelligence intercepts to report that Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince had ordered an operation targeting Khashoggi. The paper reported unnamed US officials saying Saudis had been heard discussing a plan to lure the journalist from Virginia and detain him.\n\nA state department spokesman earlier insisted the US had no forewarning on any threat.\n\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has promised a transparent investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s fate. However, many officials who provided information earlier in the inquiry are now refusing to speak, citing political sensitivities.\n\nTurkey had in recent days attempted to offer Riyadh a way to de-escalate a crisis that continues to gather momentum outside the region by suggesting that a \u201cdeep state\u201d and not senior Saudi officials were responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. However, there has been little interest from the kingdom, leading some senior Turkish officials to conclude that Riyadh does not fear the consequences.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters in Istanbul hold pictures of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Monday. Photograph: Ozan K\u00f6se/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed Riyadh is responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death, this could be their Crimea moment,\u201d said HA Hellyer, senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council and the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cRussia annexing Crimea caused justifiable huge uproar internationally, but in the end not very much happened to Putin or Russia.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi was last seen a week ago entering the consulate in Istanbul to get documents related to his forthcoming marriage.\n\nKhashoggi case is test for UK-Saudi relationship | Patrick Wintour Read more\n\nThe disappearance of the acclaimed columnist and senior adviser to previous Saudi regimes has rocked Washington, where he had been based for the past year as a columnist for the Washington Post, and struck fear through establishment circles in Riyadh, where the 59-year-old had been a popular figure.\n\nHe was one of the few public intellectuals to openly critique the new administration of Prince Mohammed. The Saudi government has denied any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance and said he left the consulate via a back entrance. Last week Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg that his government was \u201cvery keen to know what happened to him\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday Cengiz used an opinion piece for the Washington Post to appeal to Trump for help to \u201cshed light\u201d on the disappearance. \u201cI also urge Saudi Arabia, especially King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to show the same level of sensitivity and release CCTV footage from the consulate,\u201d she wrote.",

  "text": "Anita Hill said Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing was a \u201cdisservice to the American public\u201d, in her first public remarks since he was confirmed to the supreme court on Monday after one of the most narrowly won confirmation proceedings in history.\n\nHill said the Senate judiciary committee\u2019s response to Dr Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh mirrored her own experience testifying against the then supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was not only a disservice to the people who were the principal witnesses, but was a disservice to the American public,\u201d Hill said at a University of Pennsylvania event on Wednesday night. \u201cWe were all disserved in 1991 \u2013 people wanted to understand sexual harassment. In 2018, they wanted to understand sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThursday marks the 27th anniversary of Hill\u2019s testimony that Thomas had sexually harassed her when they worked together at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Senate confirmed Thomas, who denied the allegations, four days later.\n\nHill said it was \u201ca tragedy\u201d that once again, the judiciary committee rushed through its response to the respective allegations, did not interview all the witnesses and in the case of Ford, ignored 30 additional years of research into sexual misconduct.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh's ugly confirmation fight may reverberate for years inside supreme court Read more\n\n\u201cThose were all the things that I experienced in 1991 and it was what I experienced in 2018 \u2013 that failure to really help the public understand very significant issues and to understand that those issues, and seeking truth in those issues, aligned with the interest of having a supreme court that people have confidence in, they have faith in, they believe in the impartiality of and they believe in the integrity of,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHill, a professor of social policy, law, and women\u2019s studies at Brandeis University, entered Penn\u2019s Irvine auditorium to immediate, resounding applause and a standing ovation from the packed, mostly female audience of 1,200.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hill spoke with Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a law professor at UCLA and Columbia, and an adviser to Hill\u2019s legal team in 1991. Photograph: Eric Sucar/University of Pennsylvania\n\nShe spoke with Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a law professor at UCLA and Columbia law School, and an adviser to Hill\u2019s legal team in 1991. Their conversation was moderated by Dorothy Roberts, a sociology and law professor at Penn.\n\nThey were clear about what needed to change to stop this from happening again: a shock to the systems that make, and occasionally reward, sexual harassment. That included the government, the criminal justice system, the legal system and the media.\n\n\u201cChristine Blasey Ford had no support. None,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThere was no organization that was on the inside or was connected with the inside, with the decision-makers, that was going to be able to help her. We need to really understand that what we are dealing with, when we talk about these kind of abuses \u2026 we are not just dealing with behavior, we are dealing with systems that protect it, and sometimes encourage it, and sometimes reward it, and that is what you saw.\u201d\n\nDespite all this, Hill emphasized, there had been improvements in the past three decades.\n\nThat included the substantial research into sexual harassment and assault, as well as the people who had shared their stories and the legislation put in place to improve harassment reporting structures and protections.\n\n\u2018Vile hatred, hero worship': Christine Blasey Ford faces an unsettling future Read more\n\nHill said another sign of progress was how senators were reluctant to condemn Ford in public, in contrast with the parade of senators and government officials who insulted Hill in front of any television camera they could in 1991.\n\nHill said she still looked back and laughed at when Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah who is still on the judiciary committee, claimed she had plagiarized her testimony from the film The Exorcist. \u201cWhat Orrin Hatch was saying was that women who bring these claims are possessed, they are demonic, they are evil,\u201d Hill said.\n\nShe celebrated the change with a note of caution: \u201cThe deception of a pretext of fairness is almost as damning.\u201d\n\n",

  "text": "President says Seoul will \u2018do nothing without our approval\u2019 after foreign minister says sanctions review under way\n\nSouth Korea has considered lifting economic sanctions designed to force North Korea to relinquish its nuclear weapons, drawing a swift rebuke from Donald Trump and exposing a rift in Seoul\u2019s alliance with Washington.\n\nOn Thursday the South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, suggested Seoul was increasingly willing to lift sanctions imposed in 2010 after the sinking of a navy corvette that killed 46 sailors. The move would be mostly symbolic since South Korea would still be required to follow United Nations sanctions, which cover much of the same areas.\n\nKang said \u201ca review is under way\u201d when asked about the measures that prohibit almost all inter-Korean exchanges outside of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe remark drew criticism from Trump. \u201cThey won\u2019t do it without our approval. They do nothing without our approval,\u201d Trump said. In Washington, officials have vowed to maintain a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign until the North denuclearises.\n\nKim Jong-un invites pope to Pyongyang Read more\n\nKang also admitted US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had been \u201cdiscontent\u201d with a military agreement between with two Koreas, saying he was not briefed sufficiently.\n\nThe stark difference in messaging has exposed a long-simmering rift between South Korea and the US over how to deal with North Korea. Moon\u2019s liberal government has favoured closer ties with the North, but has also vowed to adhere to international sanctions which bar most trade with the regime.\n\n\u201cNo matter the substantive disagreement between the two sides, I think Seoul and Washington will move quickly to paper over his comments and maintain a facade of alignment,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy.\n\nSouth Korea still hopes to press ahead with improving ties with its neighbour, Oba said, and Moon \u201cwill continue to test the envelope but avoid any actions he thinks will cause open tensions with the United States\u201d.\n\nTrump said this week the US had \u201cmade incredible progress\u201d in dealing with North Korea, saying: \u201cYou\u2019ve got no rockets flying. You have no missiles flying. You have no nuclear testing. You have nuclear closings\u201d. But he added that Pyongyang still had to do more.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t removed sanctions. We have very big sanctions,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d love to remove them, but we have to get something for doing that.\u201d\n\nThere were also rumbles within South Korea that the idea of sanctions relief is being discussed prematurely. An editorial titled \u201cKang flubs it\u201d described her comments as \u201cshortsighted\u201d and said the paper was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d by her remarks.\n\n\u201cSanctions are the very leverage we have to denuclearise the North,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cIf the Moon administration believes Pyongyang will more actively denuclearise as long we show sincerity, that\u2019s wishful thinking.\u201d",

Torres said she saw in pre-sentencing materials that Neumeister was a trained pianist.\n\nIn June, Neumeister pleaded guilty to theft of government funds. He admitted stealing $87,000 from New York University and various grant programs from 2012 to 2014.\n\nProsecutors said he also was required to repay $76,000 after stealing money while he was at Yale from 2004 through 2010, though that was not part of the criminal case resulting in his plea.\n\nThe assistant US attorney Christopher Harwood said Neumeister was earning more than $200,000 annually while he was spending pilfered money on flights, hotel rooms and dinners for himself, his family and others.\n\nResidents of Connecticut town offered square foot of Scotland and title of laird Read more\n\nA tearful Neumeister apologized for \u201cunbelievable short-sightedness and poor judgment\u201d and said his November 2017 arrest led him to confront his psychological demons.\n\nDefense lawyers wrote in a pre-sentence submission that Neumeister oversaw studies that sought discoveries to improve treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and its effect on combat veterans, victims of sexual assault and war crimes, and those with addiction and anorexia.\n\nHis lawyer, Justine Harris, told the judge there was no easy explanation for what caused Neumeister to commit his crime.\n\n\u201cHow could someone so gifted ... do something so clearly wrong, so stupid, frankly?\u201d she said.\n\nNeumeister may return to his birthplace in Austria, she said, though the sentence was configured in a way that made it possible for him to remain in the United States.\n\nThe Connecticut resident said he was committed to regaining \u201cthe integrity I have lost\u201d.\n\n\u201cI cannot help others if I do not help myself,\u201d he told the judge.",

As Brett Kavanaugh took his seat at the end of bench, making five solidly conservative justices on the supreme court, it was the moment that Republicans have been working towards for half a century.\n\nIn ornate, serene surroundings that belied the vicious fight over a vetting process rocked by sexual assault allegations, Chief Justice John Roberts wished Kavanaugh \u201ca long and happy career in our common calling\u201d. But for protesters outside, holding signs such as \u201cWe will not forget\u201d and \u201cWe do not consent\u201d, the ideal of a common calling rings increasingly hollow.\n\nAmerica\u2019s highest court has shifted to the right and, activists say, out of sync with public opinion. The tribunal that hands down far-reaching decisions on everything from capital punishment, gun control and healthcare to labour, reproductive and voting rights is, they argue, now unrepresentative of the general population, especially its growing numbers of young people and people of colour.\n\n\u201cProviding we don\u2019t have some ideological transformation of the people on it, it seems certain we\u2019ll have a supreme court pushing out more and more decisions that are out of touch with the American people,\u201d said Neil Sroka, communications director for the political action committee Democracy for America. \u201cThe supreme court\u2019s power is in its perceived legitimacy and, as it falls more and more out of step with the American people, its legitimacy and power may be injured irrevocably.\u201d\n\nBrett Kavanaugh: divisive fight fades into silence on justice's first day Read more\n\nEstablished in 1789, the supreme court is supposed to be above the fray of political shenanigans. It has often played a role of watchdog, ensuring that neither the president nor Congress becomes too powerful. Trump has sought to bluntly politicise it, however, a move that did not seem to trouble Kavanaugh when he tore into Democrats and the Clintons during a Senate hearing.\n\nA year ago the nine-person (six men, three women) court was divided between four conservatives, four liberals and so-called \u201cswing vote\u201d Anthony Kennedy, whose unpredictable decisions managed to thrill and infuriate both sides. Kennedy\u2019s retirement this summer enabled Trump to elevate Kavanaugh, whose views on abortion, executive power and myriad other questions will tilt the court inexorably to the right. The \u201cswing\u201d vote now is Roberts, hardly a bleeding-heart liberal.\n\nWhereas Kennedy backed the 2015 decision that legalised gay marriage, Roberts opposed it. A recent survey by Gallup found that two in three Americans agree with Kennedy\u2019s position. But in the new-look court, Roberts\u2019 viewpoint seems likely to have prevailed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest After the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, left, will Chief Justice John Roberts, right, become the swing vote? Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nIn August, Emily Bazelon wrote in the New York Times magazine: \u201cSince the 1930s, justices who served as swing voters or drifted ideologically have made it possible to think about the court in nonpartisan terms. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation will probably break this long tradition. He represents the fulfillment of the dearest political wish for two generations of the conservative movement.\u201d\n\nNo one is predicting that the clock will be turned back on gay marriage but numerous other issues that once seemed settled in line with public will are suddenly on the table. Although the Republican senator Susan Collins said she was satisfied that Kavanaugh will not seek to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that enshrined abortion as a constitutional right, critics point to his past statements to suggest this is wishful thinking and warn of an all-out assault on reproductive rights.\n\nA poll in July by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal showed an all-time record in public support for Roe v Wade, with 71% saying the decision should not be overturned. Sroka said: \u201cWhen you look at polling, the majority of Americans support abortion rights and we\u2019re going to have a court with a solid majority opposing abortion rights.\n\n\u201cWe expect the court in the hands of conservatives to continue to chip away at abortion rights so they become meaningless rather than a full repeal of Roe v Wade. We have to make clear what the courts are doing when they push out obscure rulings.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh, who once dissented from a decision that upheld a Washington ban on assault weapons and magazines of more than 10 rounds, is expected to broaden gun rights and has been branded \u201ca second amendment radical\u201d. Last year Pew Research found that solid majorities of both gun owners and non-owners favour limiting access to guns for people with mental illnesses and individuals who are on the federal no-fly or watch lists. Strong majorities support background checks for private sales and at gun shows (77% among gun owners and 87% among non-owners).\n\nSroka added: \u201cYou would be delusional to think this isn\u2019t a far-right fringe court at this point. We should expect to see all sorts of assaults on our basic rights and progressive values. The Republican party has been on a 40-year quest to take control of the supreme court and, thanks to Donald Trump, they\u2019ve finally gotten that.\u201d\n\nBrett Kavanaugh's ugly confirmation fight may reverberate for years inside supreme court Read more\n\nCritics argue that the court now represents minority rule, a phrase more commonly applied to regimes such as apartheid South Africa. Trump, who has appointed the conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh to the supreme court, lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3m ballots in 2016 and has a record high disapproval rating in surveys. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 51% of people opposed Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to court while only 41% backed it.\n\nThen there is Congress. An analysis by the Washington Post found that Kavanaugh was confirmed with the support of senators representing 44.2% of the US population, while he was opposed by senators representing 55.8% (Democratic-voting states such as California and New York are densely populated). \u201cHe will be the first justice nominated by someone who lost the popular vote to earn his seat on the bench with support from senators representing less than half of the country while having his nomination opposed by a majority of the country,\u201d the Post observed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Merrick Garland: it all might have been so different if Senate Republicans had not denied Barack Obama\u2019s supreme court pick a hearing. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA\n\nDemocrats are also quick to point out that Gorsuch only claimed the seat vacated by the late Antonin Scalia because Senate Republicans blocked Barack Obama\u2019s pick, Merrick Garland, on the questionable grounds that it was a presidential election year. And Trump\u2019s lifetime appointments have been profoundly influenced by the rightwing groups the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, neither of which are democratically accountable.\n\nConservatives, however, disagree that the court faces a crisis of legitimacy. Curt Levey, president of the rightwing advocacy group the Committee for Justice, said: \u201cI\u2019ve thought up until this point the supreme court was a little to the left of the American people on many issues: abortion, gay marriage, the death penalty, immigration.\n\n\u201cI suppose if the supreme court was to vote to make abortion illegal, it would be to the right of the American people, but that\u2019s not going to happen. Even if it overturned Roe v Wade, it would mean more freedom for the states rather than an outright ban. Most people I know want some sort of compromise on abortion.\u201d\n\nFew observers believe that the now pivotal Roberts is to the left of the American people. Recent research by Stephen Jessee, an associate professor of political science at the University of Texas in Austin, and Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy of Stanford University, revealed that the two past swing justices, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and Kennedy, \u201cwere not just moderate relative to their peers, but also that they hold views that are similar to the average American citizen\u201d, Jessee said via email.\n\n\u201cThis comes despite the fact that the court was not designed to be a representative political institution. With the replacement of Kennedy with Kavanaugh, who is likely to be at least fairly (and possibly very) conservative, the median should shift to Chief Justice Roberts, who holds a position significantly to the right of the typical American. Our research estimated that Roberts is ideologically to the right of about 90% of ordinary Americans (the numbers are similarly stark for the court\u2019s more liberal members).\u201d\n\n\u2018Vile hatred, hero worship': Christine Blasey Ford faces an unsettling future Read more\n\nJessee noted views that when a justice becomes the court\u2019s median, they can feel extra responsibility and may sacrifice their own ideological preferences to produce more moderate rulings. \u201cIt is not clear whether this happens often, or whether Roberts is likely to behave this way. There is, however, some evidence that Roberts has been moving to the left in recent years, so if he continues this trend, the court may end up in a similar ideological location to when Kennedy was its swing voter.\u201d\n\nRoberts will, it is hoped, work hard to preserve the independence and integrity of the court, especially in the current highly politicised atmosphere. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard constitutional law professor whose students included Obama and Roberts, believes that the chief justice will take a \u201csubstantially different\u201d posture on the court in the wake of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Roberts will be a centrist in the way Kennedy was, or a swing vote,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cBut I think if and when there are cases about the ability to order a sitting president to testify or to indict a sitting president, or matters that go to the fate of Trump, if Kavanaugh joins Gorsuch and [Samuel] Alito and [Clarence] Thomas, I don\u2019t think we can assume Roberts will go with them.\u201d\n\nTribe, who was sharply critical of Kavanaugh\u2019s partisanship during the confirmation process, added: \u201cI think Roberts is an institutionalist, he believes in stability, he believes in the role of the court, he clearly sees it as part of his responsibility to protect it as a vital institution.\u201d\n\nThe burden will weigh heavily. At a symbolic swearing-in at the White House on Monday night, Trump issued an extraordinary apology to Kavanaugh \u201con behalf of our nation\u201d for the pain and suffering he endured during the confirmation process. On Tuesday, the president declared it \u201ca victory for the people\u201d. Of all his false or misleading claims, these do not seem likely to age well.",

  "text": "Agrochemical company is challenging a landmark ruling that ordered it to pay the award to an ex-groundskeeper dying of cancer\n\nA California judge has moved to grant the agrochemical company Monsanto a new trial after a landmark jury verdict found its herbicide had caused a man\u2019s terminal cancer.\n\nDewayne \u201cLee\u201d Johnson, a 46-year-old former groundskeeper, won a $289m award in August in a trial alleging that the popular Roundup weedkiller had made him sick and that Monsanto had failed to warn him of the risks.\n\nMonsanto, now owned by Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company, immediately appealed the verdict, which included punitive damages and economic losses and also found that Monsanto had \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d.\n\nThe San Francisco superior court judge Suzanne Bolanos cited the \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence to justify the award for punitive damages\u201d in a tentative written ruling issued before a hearing on Wednesday. She is expected to make a final decision after attorneys submit additional arguments.\n\n'The world is against them': new era of cancer lawsuits threaten Monsanto Read more\n\nMonsanto sought to overturn the verdict and has continued to argue that it is safe to use glyphosate, the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide. Glyphosate-based products, including the Roundup and Ranger Pro brands, are now worth billions of dollars in revenues, approved for use on more than 100 crops, and registered in 130 countries.\n\nTimothy Litzenburg, one of the attorneys who represented Johnson in the trial, told the Guardian that regardless of the outcome, the original ruling would still have a long-term impact: \u201cThere\u2019s been a loud and clear message.\u201d\n\nA Bayer spokesperson praised the tentative ruling in a statement, adding: \u201cThe Company continues to believe that the evidence at trial does not support the verdict and the damage awards.\u201d\n\nThe initial verdict in favor of Johnson was a historic moment in the longstanding fight against Roundup, which studies have shown is linked to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a type of blood cancer. Notably, in 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer ruled to classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen.\n\nJohnson\u2019s attorneys have also presented internal Monsanto emails that they say demonstrated the corporation\u2019s repeated efforts over the years to stifle critical research and to quietly help produce scientific reports that were favorable to glyphosate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roundup herbicide, a product of Monsanto. Photograph: Jeff Roberson/AP\n\nThose claims were bolstered last month when the scientific journal Critical Reviews in Toxicology recently issued an \u201cexpression of concern\u201d, saying that research it had published finding glyphosate to be safe had not fully declared Monsanto\u2019s involvement.\n\nMonsanto argued in court that independent research over the years has demonstrated the safety of its products.\n\nThe man who beat Monsanto: 'They have to pay for not being honest' Read more\n\nCritics of Monsanto and Bayer have also pushed for a label that would warn consumers of the cancer risks. More than 8,000 plaintiffs across the country have brought similar claims against the company echoing Johnson\u2019s complaint. A number of trials are scheduled to start next year.\n\n\u201cI think we are going to win a lot more than we lose. There will always be appeals until Bayer is ready to settle the whole liability,\u201d said Litzenburg, adding, \u201cThere are a lot of people out there suffering from this horrible disease that might\u2019ve been avoided with a tiny label.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian last month, Johnson, a father of three who became sick in 2014, said he planned to continue speaking up about the health risks of Roundup and advocate for new restrictions.\n\n\u201cThey have been hiding for years and getting away with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to pay the price for not being honest and putting people\u2019s health at risk for the sake of making a profit.\u201d\n\nJohnson is not expected to live more than two years, and doctors have previously said he might only have months left.",

  "text": "Similar challenges are sprouting up along the coast, and the golden sands and beach properties that define the state at risk\n\nOn a recent overcast October afternoon, yet another section of West Cliff Drive, the premier seafront street in Santa Cruz, California, was roped off as workers toiled to prevent it from crumbling into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe erosion gnawing away at this prized road, and the famed surfing beaches it overlooks, is emblematic of the relentless threat that climate change poses to California\u2019s coastline. As the sea level rises and storms of growing strength smash into the coast, the golden sands and beach properties that have come to define the state are at risk.\n\n\u201cI think with every coastal road in California, you\u2019re going have to think about relocating it,\u201d said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nWest Cliff Drive, which sits on an elevated bluff, hugs the coast near Santa Cruz\u2019s 111-year-old boardwalk en route to a nature reserve thick with eucalyptus. The street\u2019s beach houses and towering villas are regularly valued beyond $2m, with some vacant plots of land fetching $1m.\n\n\u201cCoastal property values are way inflated, factoring in all the risk involved,\u201d Griggs said. \u201cWest Cliff Drive is the place to be now; lots of people who made money in Silicon Valley have moved there.\u201d\n\nSanta Cruz sits on the northern lip of Monterey Bay, which is losing several feet of beach a year. Sections of the cliffs beneath West Cliff Drive are abutted by piles of rocks, known as riprap, placed as a last-ditch attempt to stem erosion.\n\nThere is only one house on the ocean side of the road, and its owners moved in recently. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have any idea what they were getting into,\u201d said Griggs, who is doing consulting work for the owners amid a tussle with authorities over riprap earlier put in place without permission. \u201cThe seawater keeps rising. In the long run, the main beach in Santa Cruz will certainly be lost, if nothing is done.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Santa Cruz sits on the northern lip of Monterey Bay, which is losing several feet of beach a year. Photograph: Marcio Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez/AP\n\nSimilar challenges are sprouting up along the California coast, particularly in the south of the state. Up to two-thirds of southern California\u2019s beaches will completely erode by the end of this century if there aren\u2019t \u201clarge-scale human interventions\u201d, according to a major report released by the state government in August. Around $48bn worth of property will be at risk should the swelling sea level increase beyond 4ft.\n\n\u201cIf we continue the path we are on there will be significant loss of beaches,\u201d said Madeline Cavalieri, a program manager at the California Coastal Commission. The response to morphing coastlines will have to involve a combination of \u201cprotection, accommodation and retreat\u201d, she added.\n\n'Privatizing the coast': are wealthy Californians seizing public beaches? Read more\n\nThis scenario is particularly painful for a place like Santa Cruz, which draws its cultural and economic strength from its beaches and pounding waves.\n\nAccording to local lore, three visiting Hawaiian princes introduced surfing to the city in 1885, when they rode the waves in longboards milled from local redwood. Surfers from around the world now descend upon Santa Cruz to spots such as Steamer Lane, where a rip hurtles into a sandstone bluff that has been in retreat since the last ice age and is now guarded by an array of rocks. A former lighthouse, now a surfing museum, overlooks surfers scrambling over the rocks and into the foaming water.\n\n\u201cIf you ask a surfer, it\u2019s very apparent that climate change is real and is happening right before our eyes,\u201d said Nick Muchas, who has lived and surfed in Santa Cruz for the past 15 years. Muchas frets about surfing spots that will suffer as the coasts recede, leading to overcrowding at the better areas, as well as the impacts on land.\n\n\u201cWest Cliff Drive is our cherished road, it\u2019s our treasure chest, and every winter we can see the whole cliff is becoming more unstable,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the surf and spray comes over it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s treacherous.\u201d\n\nErosion has shaped California\u2019s coast since long before mass industrialization started pumping planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. A rock arch near the lighthouse collapsed in the late 19th century, with just a stump remaining now. A separate rock formation, known locally as \u201cthe old shoe\u201d, is now more like the bottom of a heel.\n\nBut climate change is accelerating this process. According to a city climate plan, more than 70 Santa Cruz buildings are expected to be at risk from flooding within 12 years with 4in of sea level rise. By 2100, this grows to 390 residential and 65 commercial properties, along with seven miles of roads. This would come with \u201chigh rates of beach and coastal bluff retreat\u201d, the document states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say right now what that means, but we do know that tourism is a major driver of our economy here locally,\u201d said Tiffany Wise-West, the sustainability and climate action manager for the city of Santa Cruz. \u201cWhat if [residents] do have to move at some point? We already have an affordable housing crisis here in Santa Cruz.\u201d\n\nAlong about a tenth of the California coast, the response to this threat has been to erect seawalls or dump protective rocks. While this may buy time for expensive low-lying infrastructure \u2013 waste water treatment plants, power stations, the airports at San Francisco and San Jose \u2013 the barriers can exacerbate the loss of beaches.\n\nAs the sea level rises, beaches would naturally migrate inland with the retreating coastline. But fixed points such as seawalls prevent this shift, trapping and in effect drowning the sand as the sea rises and storms take their toll.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Surfers from around the world descend upon Santa Cruz to spots such as Steamer Lane. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP\n\nRoads, sidewalks and buildings also provide a barrier, which presents a conundrum for cities such as Santa Cruz that want to avoid the opposing financial cataclysms of losing their beaches or having to relocate buildings and people en masse to safer ground inland.\n\nThe hard choices won\u2019t be deferred for much longer. California\u2019s coastal commission has been pushing Santa Cruz to come up with an erosion plan for West Cliff Drive and the city is turning to residents for feedback.\n\nMore defences may be erected; some areas may have to be abandoned. The state is keen on \u201cgreen\u201d solutions \u2013 seeding wetlands or other vegetation to slow the tides \u2013 but that is tough to do in Santa Cruz, with its steep cliffs and hefty waves.\n\nCalifornia plans to show the world how to meet the Paris climate target | Dana Nuccitelli Read more\n\nThe retreating coastline isn\u2019t the only climate challenge Santa Cruz, like many coastal locations, is facing. Heatwaves threaten the sick and elderly, while lengthening wildfire seasons risk choking the city with smoke. The city, already unaffordable for many residents, could see a future influx of people seeking to escape from baking temperatures inland.\n\n\u201cI would say we are on the leading edge in terms of understanding our risks and being proactive and addressing them,\u201d Wise-West said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty daunting topic, though.\u201d",

  "title": "Should everyone be taking vitamin D?",
  "url": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181010-do-vitamin-d-supplements-work",
  "text": "As the days get shorter in the Northern hemisphere, concerns tend to arise about the lack of sunlight \u2013 and possible vitamin D deficiency. For many, a go-to fix is to take supplements.\n\nThe supplement, after all, has been touted as a near-miracle. Both vitamin D2 and D3 supplements are available over-the-counter without a prescription and have been linked to improving immunity, tiredness and muscle weakness, bone pain, and depression. They\u2019ve also been said to help stave off cancer and the consequences of ageing.\n\nIt may be little wonder that, according to research by market analysis company Mintel, a third of adults in the UK who take vitamin supplements count vitamin D among them.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Why vitamin supplements don\u2019t work\n\n\u2022 The world\u2019s most nutritious foods\n\n\u2022 What I learnt by living without artificial light\n\nBut the debate over whether all adults need to take vitamin D supplements is contentious.\n\nOne study estimates that around 20% of the population in the UK has a profound vitamin D deficiency\n\nFew doubt the role that vitamin D plays in our bone health to regulate calcium and phosphate in the body, which is why those who have a vitamin D deficiency are particularly encouraged to address it. And that may be more people than you think: one study estimates that around 20% of the population in the UK has a profound vitamin D deficiency, for example.\n\nBut some experts say that people with healthy levels have no need of vitamin D supplements \u2013 which would be most people. In other words, they argue that in healthy people, vitamin D is not, as some have hoped, a way to prevent disease.\n\nSo what\u2019s the reality?\n\nThe basics\n\nDespite its name, vitamin D is not a vitamin. Instead, it is a hormone that promotes the absorption of calcium in the body. The challenge is that, aside from a few foods like oily fish, vitamin D is hard to find in the average diet. But in the presence of \u2018ultraviolet B\u2019 rays, our skin can produce its own from a common cholesterol.\n\nThere are two main types of D. The first is vitamin D3, which is found in animals including fish and is the kind the skin makes when exposed to sunlight. The second is vitamin D2, which comes from plant-based foods including mushrooms. Studies have found that D3 is more effective, and the conclusions of a 2012 meta-analysis argue that D3 is the preferred choice for supplementation.\n\nToday, the UK\u2019s Public Health England (PHE) recommends every adult takes a 10-microgram supplement in autumn and winter, when the angle of the sunlight hitting the earth prevents as many UVB rays from penetrating the atmosphere. The government body also recommends that those at risk of lower vitamin D levels, including people with darker skin, take a supplement year-round.\n\nOther countries follow similar guidelines. In Canada, adults are advised to get 15 micrograms of vitamin D and have two servings of vitamin-D fortified milk or soy alternatives every day, while cow's milk and margarine must be fortified with vitamin D by law. In the US, adults also are advised to get 15 micrograms, while much of the country\u2019s milk, breakfast cereals, margarine, yogurts and orange juice is fortified, too.\n\nThose guidelines and fortification efforts came about largely in an attempt to fight rickets in the mid-20th Century. We know that low vitamin D levels reduce the body\u2019s levels of calcium, which leads to a decrease in bone density and can cause rickets, particularly in babies and children.\n\nWe also know that low vitamin D may cause muscle weakness and fatigue. One study found that low vitamin D was high among people with fatigue and that their symptoms improved after five weeks of vitamin D supplements, while a small study from Newcastle University found that low vitamin D could cause fatigue as low levels cause mitochondria, the \u2018power stations\u2019 in every cell of the body, to be less efficient. Studies of cancer patients have found similar effects. Vitamin D may also help bolster and regulate the immune system by clearing bacteria.\n\nBroken bones\n\nBut vitamin D\u2019s importance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people with healthy levels of vitamin D require supplements. Consider one of the most common reasons for supplementation: bone growth and maintenance.\n\nThe current guidelines on how much vitamin D to take were informed by research involving the elderly population living in care homes, who don\u2019t get as much exposure to the sun and are more prone to fractures and osteoporosis than the general population. But Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, has argued that such studies are \u201cprobably flawed\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the evidence isn\u2019t clear-cut. One meta-analysis published in August 2018 concluded that increasing the levels of vitamin D in the general population is unlikely to decrease the risk of bone fractures in healthy people. And a meta-analysis of 81 studies found that vitamin D supplementation doesn\u2019t prevent fractures or falls, or improve bone mineral density. The researchers concluded that guidelines should be updated to reflect this.\n\nBut Sarah Leyland, osteoporosis nurse consultant at the National Osteoporosis Society, says vitamin D supplements may be useful for at-risk groups who don\u2019t get any sunlight exposure. According to the NHS, people only need to be outside for a short period of time, with hands and forearms uncovered and without sunscreen, to get enough vitamin D between March and October.\n\nHealthy people won\u2019t reduce their fracture risk by taking calcium and vitamin D supplements \u2013 Sarah Leyland\n\n\u201cWe know that healthy people living in the community won\u2019t reduce their fracture risk by taking calcium and vitamin D supplements,\u201d Leyland says. \u201cHowever, people who may not be getting enough \u2013 such as those who are housebound or live in sheltered accommodation \u2013 can benefit from these supplements.\u201d\n\nStill, researchers haven\u2019t found clear evidence of that, either. One meta-analysis examining the prevention of fractures in community, nursing home and hospital inpatient populations concluded that vitamin D alone is unlikely to prevent fractures in the doses and formulations tested so far in older people. And some evidence suggests that high doses can actually result in an increased number of fractures and falls. One randomised study found that high-dose monthly vitamin D supplements increased the risk of falls among the elderly population by 20-30% compared to those on a lower dose.\n\nD for disease\n\nThere is also conflicting research on the relationship between vitamin D and other diseases, even ageing.\n\nOne main claim is that vitamin D supplements will boost the immune system. Adrian Martineau, professor of respiratory infection and immunity at The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, who leads a research group on the effects of vitamin D on health, has found that vitamin D plays a role in improving respiratory infections.\n\nWhen his team analysed raw data from 25 clinical trials involving 11,000 patients from 14 countries, they found a small benefit to taking daily or weekly vitamin D supplements to reduce the risk of respiratory infections, asthma attacks and bronchitis. Although the paper soon attracted robust criticism, Martineau points out that the reduction of risk, while slight, is still significant and comparable to the effects of other health measures: to prevent a single respiratory infection, you\u2019d have to give 33 people vitamin D supplements \u2013 compared to, for example, giving a flu vaccination to 40 people to prevent a single case of flu.\n\nOr take ageing. One paper looking at the link between vitamin D and life expectancy found that vitamin D3 can help with protein homeostasis \u2013 the process by which proteins are regulated within cells to maintain their health. \u201cOur observation that D3 improves protein homeostasis and slows ageing highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate vitamin D serum levels,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nBut other studies have been less conclusive. One meta-analysis concluded that more research is needed to clarify the effect of vitamin D on mortality. The link between cardiovascular disease and vitamin D also has yet been properly established: the link could mean that heart disease is causing low vitamin D levels, not the other way around.\n\nCorrelation or causation?\n\nThis is an issue with nearly all of the studies that link low D to diseases.\n\nIf you take any group of patients with almost any disease, their vitamin D levels will be lower than in a healthy individual \u2013 Ian Reid\n\nIan Reid, professor in medicine at the University of Auckland, believes that diseases cause low vitamin D levels, as being unwell often leads to spending less time outdoors exposed to sunlight, rather than vice versa. \u201cIf you take any group of patients with almost any disease, their vitamin D levels will be lower than in a healthy individual. This has led some to hypothesise it\u2019s low vitamin D developing the disease, but there\u2019s no evidence to prove it,\u201d he says.\n\nResearchers have found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer \u2013 it plays a role in stemming the formation of new blood vessels and stimulating better communication between cells. Vitamin D also has been found to help maintain normal levels of calcium in the colon, which slows growth of non-cancerous but high-risk cells.\n\nOther studies, including of the link between vitamin D and liver cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, suggest there is good reason to think that low vitamin D plays a part in the spread of cancer cells. But taking supplements would then, surely, help stave off cancer \u2013 and a recent meta-analysis failed to find that supplementation reduced cancer risk.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to be a two-way street, with cancer causing vitamin D deficiency by affecting vitamin D metabolism, dietary intake and sun exposure, and vice versa via anti-proliferative effects of vitamin D. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive,\u201d says Martineau.\n\nD for depression\n\nAnother oft-discussed condition is seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a mood disorder caused by the seasonal drop in exposure to sunlight. The link between light exposure and SAD is long-established. But again, a direct link to vitamin D has been difficult to prove.\n\nVitamin D is associated with levels of both serotonin, important for mood regulation, and melatonin, which regulates our sleep\n\nEvidence suggests there may be a relationship since vitamin D is associated with levels of both serotonin, important for mood regulation, and melatonin, which regulates our sleep. Low levels of either hormone could contribute to SAD symptoms. Researchers have yet to carry out a definitive randomised control trial, however, and the exact mechanism by which vitamin D bolsters the hormones is unknown. One theory is that vitamin D receptors \u2013 which are found in many parts of the brain and concentrated in the hypothalamus, a region involved in our circadian timing \u2013 play a part in controlling the body\u2019s hormone levels.\n\nResearch has found that vitamin D plays a wider role in our mental health, from depression to schizophrenia, as well as in brain development, but how it plays a role also remains unclear. A meta-analysis published earlier this year found that while there is a correlation between lower vitamin D levels and depression, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean D caused depression.\n\nAgain, perhaps depressed people just went out less and got less sunlight.\n\nSunshine serum\n\nIf studies are inconclusive, though, perhaps that doesn\u2019t reflect on the importance of vitamin D. Perhaps it\u2019s the fact that most of them are based on supplements, not sunshine.\n\nSome scientists argue that getting vitamin D from supplements isn\u2019t as effective as getting it straight from the sun, as the process that happens before the body makes vitamin D from sun exposure is more beneficial. More conclusive research around this is currently underway.\n\nEven so, most experts generally agree that even vitamin D supplements can benefit those who have very low levels. Martineau says his research found that those with low levels of vitamin D tend to see the most benefits of supplementation preventing respiratory infections, whereas the effects are a lot more modest when levels are moderately low.\n\nReid says his studies have also shown benefits in those with low levels. But as most people have vitamin D levels above that threshold, they wouldn\u2019t see benefits from supplementing.\n\nThe trouble is that it can be difficult to predict who is at a highest risk of suffering from low vitamin D. As medical historian Roberta Bivins of the University of Warwick points out, the amount of vitamin D a person stores, and therefore requires over winter, isn\u2019t just dependent on skin tone and the amount of time a person spend outdoors.\n\nIt\u2019s very individual how much sun exposure a person needs \u2013 Roberta Bivins\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very individual how much sun exposure a person needs during summer, depending on the pigment in the skin to the amount of fat in the body and how quickly your body makes new bone. It\u2019s incredibly complicated,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s why the best way to determine if you have low vitamin D is not by symptoms alone, but with a blood test arranged through your medic.\n\nSupplement levels\n\nThen there is the question of exactly what level of supplementation people need. Reid says there\u2019s \u201cno danger\u201d in taking over-the-counter vitamin D of less than 25 nanomols per day.\n\nBut with supplements offering doses as high as 62.5 micrograms available over the counter, there are concerns around the risk of excessive vitamin D levels, which can, in rare cases, cause side effects, including nausea and vomiting. In the long term, some studies suggest too much vitamin D can increase risk of cardiovascular disease, although the research isn\u2019t conclusive.\n\nBut others argue that even more vitamin D is needed.\n\nIn 2012, chief medical officer Sally Davies wrote a letter to GPs urging them to recommend vitamin D supplements to all at-risk groups, writing that a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of people in the UK probably have inadequate levels of vitamin D. In June 2018, researchers from the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research wrote that the death of a baby from complications of heart failure caused by severe vitamin D deficiency, and the serious health complications of two others, was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d in vitamin D deficiencies among those at risk.\n\nSuma Uday, co-author of the paper and PhD doctoral researcher at the university, says these deficiencies occur because infant vitamin D supplementation programs are poorly implemented in the UK and not monitored. \u201cIn the infants we describe, deficiency occurred because infant vitamin D supplementation was not recommended or monitored. Any infant devoid of vitamin D for prolonged durations can develop low calcium levels, which can result in life threatening complications such as seizures and heart failure,\u201d she says.\n\nWith such conflicting results, it\u2019s unsurprising that medical experts themselves are deeply divided over the benefits of widespread supplementation. Some even argue that vested interests are propping up the billion-dollar vitamin industry, with Spector calling vitamin D supplements a \u201cpseudo-vitamin for a pseudo-disease\u201d.\n\nWhile the debate continues, many experts are looking to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School in Boston, whose researchers are carrying out a long-awaited randomised trial, VITAL, to investigate whether supplementation of vitamin D and omega 3 has any effect on cancer, stroke and heart disease in 25,000 adults.\n\nIt\u2019s hoped that these results, expected to publish later this year, will bring the debate closer to being resolved. In the meantime, it\u2019s widely agreed that vitamin D supplements, especially over winter, will be a waste of money at worst.\n\nIt\u2019s likely you won\u2019t get enough from your diet between now and next spring, but the impact this could have on your health is still up for debate.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAll content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

  "text": "As Ireland\u2019s economy struggled in the wake of the global financial crisis and people were left wondering how they could keep up with their mortgages, Sorcha Coyle took the plunge and moved to the Middle East.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the idea of a new challenge that the teacher found exciting, but the fact that by working overseas she would be in a better position to reach the financial goals she\u2019d set herself than if she stayed at home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been in Ireland during the recession and was surrounded by family and friends who had lost their jobs, weren\u2019t able to pay their inflated mortgages and who were mentally and physically exhausted by money worries,\u201d Coyle recalls from Dubai, where the 32-year-old now lives.\n\nThe decision proved life-changing.\n\nThe money worries Coyle saw her friends struggling with and that she herself had endured earlier when teaching in the UK \u2013 spending more than 50% of her salary on rent, leaving little for savings \u2013 have disappeared. Since her first expatriate job in Qatar in 2011, she has saved more than $186,000 and purchased two properties, including a four-bedroom house in her hometown. She\u2019s even managed to travel.\n\n\u201cOne year as an expat could be the financial equivalent of three years back home,\u201d says Andrew Talbot, who has been a certified financial planner for 18 years and currently works with Expat Financial Planning in Singapore.\n\n45% said they got more money for the same job by moving abroad, while 28% said they got a promotion\n\nAccording to new research from HSBC, the \u201caverage\u201d expat adds an extra $21,000 to their annual salary by moving overseas. Some 45% of those who responded to the bank\u2019s annual Expat Explorer survey say they got more money for the same job by moving abroad, while 28% said they got a promotion.\n\n\u201cIt absolutely is life-changing,\u201d says John Goddard, head of HSBC Expat, who\u2019s now based in the Channel Islands and has himself worked overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. \u201cThat extra income helps people prepare for their future life. Over a third say they were able to put money away for retirement. Another third say they used it get on the property ladder.\u201d\n\nThe HSBC Expat survey was open to those older than 18 and working away from their home countries. More than 22,000 people responded \u2013 mostly professionals with jobs above entry-level \u2013 executives who generally enjoy higher levels of income to begin with. Of the 163 countries and territories surveyed, respondents had the biggest average annual salaries in Switzerland ($202,865), the United States ($185,119) and Hong Kong ($178,706).\n\nRespondents had the biggest average annual salaries in Switzerland ($202,865), the United States ($185,119) and Hong Kong ($178,706)\n\nBut these days there are numerous types of professional working abroad \u2013 from the traditional expat on a generous package to a millennial who\u2019s moved overseas in the hope of getting more experience, new skills and learning more about the world.\n\nYvonne McNulty, a global mobility expert based in Singapore, says that high-paying \u201cexpat\u201d packages that include housing, school fees and a car allowance \u2013 are fast disappearing.\n\nShe points to a number of recent surveys that support this trend: a 2017 KPMG survey on global assignments found just 27% of respondents expected their use of standard expat assignments \u2013 the ones that tend to attract generous pay and benefits packages \u2013 to increase. Some 29% expected them to decrease and were looking at extended business trips, short-term assignments and local hires to meet their international staffing needs. A 2018 survey from corporate relocation providers Cartus found cost concerns underpinned the shift away from the traditional long-term assignment, which is seen as increasingly expensive.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you can work abroad for your company and \u2018get rich\u2019 or earn more than at home is outdated,\u201d says Yvonne McNulty. \u201cIt\u2019s a fallacy.\u201d\n\nThat said, people can benefit from lower rates of income tax outside their home countries. In Dubai, there\u2019s no tax at all. In Singapore, the top rate is 22% and in Hong Kong it\u2019s 17%. That compares with 45% in European countries like the UK and France.\n\nBut that\u2019s only one part of the equation.\n\nMany of the countries where salaries are high are also some of the world\u2019s most expensive. Hong Kong was ranked the world\u2019s most expensive place for expatriates to live in Mercer\u2019s 2018 Cost of Living survey, with Zurich in third.\n\nAdded to this is lifestyle creep \u2013 the idea that as your salary increases, so does your spending. For those on a foreign posting with a big pay bump, it\u2019s tempting to fritter that money away on more nights out or high-end holidays.\n\nThe key, according to Talbot, whether you are single or with your family, on a generous expat package or an increasingly common \u201clocal\u201d or \u201clocal plus\u201d deal, is to decide the kind of lifestyle that you want, establish a financial plan and budget accordingly.\n\n\u201cPeople need to ask themselves what they want at the end of their stint overseas \u2013 do they want to pay off the mortgage, have a certain amount in the bank or buy a second property,\u201d he says. \u201cDecide on your goal and stick to that. You should always have a plan.\u201d\n\nMai Tatoy, 48, moved to Singapore more than 20 years ago after the events company she worked for in Manila offered her a position in the city-state with a salary that was six times more than she\u2019d earned at home.\n\nWorking overseas has allowed Tatoy, a Filipino who now has permanent residence, to buy one house for herself and another for her parents (she also covers their monthly expenses), as well as a number of investment-linked mutual funds. She\u2019s also built up her savings in case of an emergency.\n\nAnd while the cost of living has risen substantially over the years Tatoy has lived in Singapore, her less-than-extravagant lifestyle has helped make her money go further. \u201cI\u2019m so into cheap and cheerful,\u201d she says. \u201cI take the bus around the city most of the time and pay my credit cards on time and in full every month. I do feel I \u2018bought\u2019 myself freedom from the burden of worry and debts.\u201d\n\nLike Tatoy, Abdul Rahim Miah is not a \u201ctraditional\u201d expat with a generous benefits package.\n\nA British citizen, the 25-year-old trained physiotherapist moved to Malaysia a couple of years ago to work with a football club and be with family. Visa problems meant his original job didn\u2019t work out and he\u2019s now a manager at a gym.\n\nI earned better money working part-time in a cinema in the UK than I do working part-time here \u2013 Abdul Rahim Miah\n\n\u201cI earned better money working part-time in a cinema in the UK than I do working part-time here,\u201d he says. And while Kuala Lumpur\u2019s lower cost of living means Rahim still has money to spend, he cautions anyone who thinks that a job overseas is a ticket to riches. \u201cWeigh the pros and cons carefully,\u201d he says.\n\nOver in Dubai, Coyle helps other teachers looking to go international through her blog, which offers advice and information on working in international schools and living in the cities where they\u2019re located, as well as negotiating the best package.\n\nShe admits it is easy to be seduced by the idea of the well-paid expat, and says discipline is necessary even with a potentially large windfall. After seven years overseas, and feeling more financially secure, she is now looking to the future.\n\n\u201cI have put a limit on my time as an expat teacher,\u201d she says. \u201cMy parents are getting older and my friends at home are starting to get married and have children. I no longer want to be that person who comes home only twice a year.\u201d\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

  "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45822845",
  "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The malfunction became apparent about 90 seconds into the flight\n\nA US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut were forced to make an emergency landing after their Russian Soyuz rocket malfunctioned en route to the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nShortly after taking off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Nick Hague and Alexey Ovchinin reported a problem with the rocket's booster.\n\nThe men were forced into a \"ballistic descent\", with their capsule landing a few hundred miles north of Baikonur.\n\nThey have been picked up by rescuers.\n\n\"The search and recovery teams have reached the Soyuz spacecraft landing site and report that the two crew members... are in good condition and are out of the capsule,\" US space agency Nasa said.\n\nRussia said it was suspending any further manned flights, and an investigation into what went wrong had begun.\n\nWhat happened to the rocket?\n\nThe launch appeared to be going smoothly, but some 90 seconds later Nasa, on its livestream, reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation.\n\nFootage from inside the capsule showed the two men being shaken around at the moment that the fault happened.\n\nShortly afterwards, Nasa said they were making a \"ballistic descent\" meaning their capsule descended at a much sharper angle than normal and would have been subjected to greater G-force - the force imposed on a body by rapid acceleration.\n\nThe capsule separated from the failing rocket and later deployed parachutes to slow its descent.\n\nAnalysis: An uncomfortable ride back to Earth\n\nBy Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nSoyuz is one of the oldest rocket designs but also one of the safest. The malfunction appeared to occur around what is termed \"staging\", where the ascending vehicle goes through the process of discarding its empty fuel segments.\n\nThe onboard astronauts were certainly aware that something was not right because they reported feeling weightless when they should have felt pushed back in their seats. The escape systems are tested and ready for exactly this sort of eventuality. It would have been an uncomfortable ride back to Earth, however. The crew would have experienced very sharp deceleration on the return.\n\nThere is already much discussion about the current state of Russian industry and its ability to maintain the standards of yesteryear. Whatever the outcome of the inquiry, this event will only heighten those concerns and will underline to the US in particular the need to bring online new rocket systems. These vehicles, produced by the Boeing and SpaceX companies, are set to make their debut next year.\n\nHow are the crew?\n\nThey seem to have been unharmed by the experience.\n\nSearch and rescue teams were quickly on the scene, 500km (310 miles) north-east of Baikonur, near the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan.\n\nThey reported that Mr Hague and Mr Ovchinin were alive and well.\n\n\"The emergency rescue system worked, the vessel was able to land in Kazakhstan... the crew are alive,\" Russia's space agency Roscosmos tweeted. Nasa described them as being in good condition. They reportedly did not need medical treatment.\n\nNasa added that the two men were being taken to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, and it was \"monitoring the situation carefully\".\n\nPhotos have been released showing the men sitting on a sofa and having their blood pressure and heart rates monitored.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nRussia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said no further manned missions would take place \"until we believe that the entire situation guarantees safety\".\n\nHe rejected suggestions it could harm US relations, saying they recognised it was a \"hi-tech industry linked to risk\", but he added: \"We certainly won't conceal the reasons, it is uncommon for such situations\".\n\nThe crew already on the ISS will not be affected by Thursday's aborted mission, Russia's Tass news agency reported, quoting an unnamed source as saying they have enough supplies.\n\nHave there been similar incidents in the past?\n\nThursday's incident is thought to be the first launch mishap for a Russian Soyuz booster since a Soyuz mission was aborted in 1983. A rocket malfunctioned shortly after launch, and the crew vehicle was ejected to safety.\n\nIn recent years, Russia's space programme has faced a number of technical failures - 13 since 2010.\n\nLast year, contact was lost with a Soyuz rocket's Fregat upper stage, which was carrying a new weather satellite and 18 secondary satellites.\n\nEarlier in 2017, at least nine of a payload of 73 satellites were reported \"dead on arrival or severely degraded\" after separation from their Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle\n\nIn August, a hole appeared in a Soyuz capsule already docked to the ISS which caused a brief loss of air pressure and had to be patched.

  "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump has often cut an isolated figure on the world stage\n\nAt a moment when America has been focussed myopically on the highest court in the land, the Trump administration stands accused of being a bystander to lawlessness around the world.\n\nThe forced disappearance of the Interpol chief, Meng Hongwei, who it turns out is being held by the Chinese authorities.\n\nMounting evidence underscoring the Kremlin's involvement in the chemical poisonings in Salisbury.\n\nThe seemingly gruesome case of Jamal Khashoggi, the missing journalist who Turkish authorities suspect was killed and dismembered by a Saudi hit squad inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.\n\nAll point to a world of disorder: of a slide towards unruliness; of a new era of strongman authoritarianism and a waning of international law.\n\nTraditionally the United States has viewed itself as the upholder of norms, an exemplar of moral leadership, the policeman of global bad behaviour - an idealised notion it has not always lived up to.\n\nBut this week has driven home not just how much Donald Trump has been reluctant to perform that role. It also speaks of how his doctrine of patriotism is at risk of being interpreted by other nations as a doctrine of anything goes.\n\nIn the red, white and blue of America First do other countries see a green light to act with impunity?\n\nOn Wednesday, the president described Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance as \"very serious\" and said his administration had raised the case at the \"highest levels\" with Riyadh.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A young protester clutches a photo of the Saudi journalist\n\nThe national security adviser, John Bolton, and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have spoken to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Plans are also afoot for a White House meeting with the journalist's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz.\n\nBut the president has stopped short of condemning or criticising the Saudi Arabians, even though the Washington Post reports US intelligence intercepted communications of Saudi officials plotting to capture Khashoggi, one of the newspaper's columnists and a prominent critic of the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nThe Khashoggi disappearance has been absent from Donald Trump's Twitter feed, his preferred outlet for presidential outrage.\n\nHe has not mentioned it at his campaign rallies, another forum where he regular gives vent to his most visceral feelings. Though he smiled on Tuesday night when a rally crowd in Iowa aimed a \"Lock Her Up\" chant at Senator Diane Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he said nothing about the journalist's disappearance.\n\nClearly, the White House is keen to avoid a rush to judgment and says it is \"demanding\" answers from Riyadh. But is Donald Trump's circumspection merely a cover to avoid reproaching his Saudi allies?\n\nFor a president who does not normally hesitate, it could easily be construed as moral foot-dragging and an abdication of traditional American leadership.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have been more damning. Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said \"there will definitely be consequences\" if it turns out the Saudis were involved. Lindsey Graham, the president's golf buddy, said it would be \"devastating\" to US-Saudi relations. No such public warnings have come from the White House.\n\nPresident Trump has befriended the Crown Prince, and been staunch in his support of the Saudi leadership.\n\nHis first international visit was to Saudi Arabia, where he took part in that that mystical-looking ceremony during which he placed his hands on a glowing orb.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the more bizarre photos of 2017\n\nThe Trump administration has backed the Saudi-led bombing campaign of Yemen, part of Riyadh's proxy war with Tehran.\n\nLast November, the president endorsed the royal purge of Saudi princes, businessman and government ministers under the auspices of an anti-corruption drive. He has approved a $1bn (\u00a3757m) arms package to the royal kingdom.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump also reiterated his admiration for the 33-year old crown prince, calling him a \"fine man\". He continues to speak of the Crown Prince with almost fatherly pride.\n\nOne of the most marked features of President Trump's foreign policy has been his denigration of close allies and acclamation of leaders who flatter him, whatever their human rights records.\n\nPresently, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is organising a second summit with Kim Jong-un. And even though the dictator has been accused among other brutalities of carrying out executions with anti-aircraft guns and of detaining up to 130,000 North Koreans in gulags, the president told a rally in West Virginia last week he \"fell in love\" with the North Korean at the Singapore summit.\n\nDonald Trump has praised Egypt's autocratic president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, describing him as \"a fantastic guy.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why does Trump admire strongmen leaders?\n\nHe has commended Rodrigo Dutertes, the president of the Philippines, for an \"unbelievable job on the drug problem,\" even though the crackdown has led to the killing of 12,000 suspected drug dealers and users, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nHe has given Recep Erdogan of Turkey \"very high marks\", despite widespread criticism of the president's increasingly authoritarian rule. Then there is his well-documented averseness to criticising Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe die was arguably cast in the first weeks of the Trump presidency during an interview with the former Fox News host Bill Reilly. \"Putin is a killer,\" said O'Reilly, when Trump expressed respect for the former KGB spymaster.\n\n\"There are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers,\" replied the US president, with almost a shrug of the shoulders. \"Well, you think our country is so innocent?\"\n\nAs well as suggesting moral parity between the thuggishness of the Kremlin and the actions of successive US administrations, his remarks signalled a temporary end to American exceptionalism, the idea the US should hold other countries to a higher standard and exemplify them itself.\n\nThe departure of Nikki Haley is another inflection point. When she steps down as the UN ambassador at the end of the year, the administration will lose its most outspoken defender of international norms.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump took decisive action in Syria which prompted protests in New York\n\nHaley has been a strident critic of Moscow and Damascus especially. But she, too, has been criticised by human rights groups, for advocating US withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council and defending Israel's use of lethal force in Gaza that left 150 demonstrators dead.\n\nNot every international crime has gone unpunished. Twice Donald Trump has authorised limited airstrikes against the Assad regime in retaliation for its use of chemical weapons, enforcing the kind of red lines that Barack Obama paid lip service to but failed to uphold.\n\nYet President Trump has often been reluctant to take punitive action.\n\nAs Bob Woodward's new book Fear chronicled, the president fumed at aides for pushing him to expel 60 Russian diplomats and suspected spies in retaliation for the Salisbury nerve agent attack. He wanted a more limited response.\n\nIt does not help that Donald Trump has so been aggressively critical of journalists, routinely describing them as \"enemies of the people.\" The Washington Post, along with the New York Times, is a b\u00eate noire. Again, how are these attacks against the free press interpreted around the world by despots who want to silence their critics?\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has also been fiercely critical of the International Criminal Court, a body successive administrations have been wary of.\n\nJohn Bolton warned that if the ICC came after the US or Israel, the Trump administration would ban its judges and prosecutors from entering the United States, sanction their funds and prosecute them in the US criminal system.\n\nHas the US judiciary itself this week taken a hit? Certainly, it was unusual to see Brett Kavanaugh's swearing-in ceremony at the White House take on the character of a Republican pep rally.\n\nSome of the Supreme Court justices in attendance looked distinctly uncomfortable about the politicisation of the event.\n\nThis week, the president spoke of \"evil\" people, a word in the presidential lexicon deployed by his predecessors against the Soviet empire (Ronald Reagan) and Iraq, Iran and North Korea (George W. Bush).\n\nBut he was not talking about the Khashoggi disappearance or international maleficence more broadly, but rather the accusers of his Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThese days the US president's strongest language is directed at political enemies at home.",

  "url": "http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20181005-the-last-lighthouse-keeper-of-capri",
  "text": "Basking in the Bay of Naples, Capri is Italy at its most dazzling. Whitewashed villas burst with purple bougainvillea, yachts putter around the island\u2019s glimmering grottoes and what was once an idyllic home of fishermen is now an exclusive glitterati haunt.\n\nA machine can power a light, but it can\u2019t watch the sea\n\nBut every evening in a modest apartment on the island\u2019s remote south-western tip, a 64-year-old sailor named Carlo D\u2019Oriano slowly climbs 136 steps up a spiral staircase to the lonely lookout tower of the Punta Carena lighthouse and peers through a pair of binoculars across the ocean. When the sun sinks into the Tyrrhenian Sea, D\u2019Oriano logs his handwritten findings in a diary, just as the island\u2019s lighthouse keeper has done each day here for the last 151 years.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The last surviving sea silk seamstress\n\n\u2022 Canada\u2019s tiny disputed island\n\n\u2022 Why people are obsessed with Fair Isle\n\nBuilt in 1867, Punta Carena is one of Italy\u2019s most important lighthouses, and is one of the last in the world to employ a full-time operator. But after being manned by a continuous line of 88 lighthouse keepers predating the dawn of Italian unification in 1871, D\u2019Oriano is its last guardian, and these are his final months on duty.\n\nLast year, D\u2019Oriano received word from Italy\u2019s Ministry of Defence that Punta Carena, like 181 of the country\u2019s other 199 lighthouses, is set to become fully automated on 1 January 2019. When it does, D\u2019Oriano won\u2019t just lose his job \u2013 he\u2019ll lose his home of 13 years.\n\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\n\n\u201cThink about how many keepers have lived inside these walls, always keeping the light on to guide others,\u201d D\u2019Oriano said, gazing out from the lantern room towards the twilight. \u201cThis work is beautiful, but it\u2019s dying.\u201d\n\nAs long as there have been ships, there have been light keepers. Thousands of years ago, people lit bonfires high atop cliffs to guide sailors to port. Around 280BC, these ground-lit beacons were raised onto towers, like the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Wood pyres evolved into coal, gas, oil and electricity, and today, according to The Lighthouse Directory, more than 20,500 of these enduring landmarks still illuminate the world\u2019s darkest and most dangerous stretches of coastline.\n\nBut as marine navigation tools and satellite automation have become more sophisticated, the need for lighthouses and their human operators has been virtually snuffed out. In fact, with the exception of seasonal volunteers and educational guides, there are hardly any lighthouse keepers left on the planet.\n\nThe UK\u2019s last custodian left his post at the North Foreland Lighthouse in Kent in 1998 \u2013 the same year, the US Coast Guard automated the last of its 279 federally run beacons. Australia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway and many other nations no longer employ a single operator. One stalwart sentinel remains in South Africa; three in France; a handful in India, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and Portugal; and fewer than 50 in Canada.\n\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be more than about 200 left in the world,\u201d said Ian Duff, president of the international Association of Lighthouse Keepers, who himself kept the light shining at Skerryvore, Duncansby Head and Tiree Island in Scotland for nearly two decades before being made redundant in 1992. \u201cThe reality is, in 10 years, this job will be extinct.\u201d\n\nYet despite not hiring a single new lighthouse keeper from outside the military since 1987, the captain of Italy\u2019s Lighthouse Authority, Antonello D\u2019Esposito, told me that they still receive roughly 5,000 applications every year for a position that no longer exists.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m the lucky one,\u201d D\u2019Oriano said, wiping the salt from Punta Carena\u2019s storm windows.\n\nD\u2019Oriano joined the navy in 1975 and was stationed up and down the Italian coast for the next 30 years. Then in 2005, a navy commander tipped him off that a rare position was opening at Punta Carena, and that his decades of experience as a nautical technician, harbour pilot and sailor would make him a good fit.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the first thing about working in a lighthouse,\u201d D\u2019Oriano admitted. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even seen a picture of the place. But when I did, it was love at first sight.\u201d\n\nRising 28m atop a narrow limestone bluff that plunges into the ocean, Punta Carena casts a striking image. Its rotating optical lens is the second most powerful in Italy, and its flashing beams stretch 25 nautical miles through one of the country\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. The base and spiral staircase were built with lava stone from Mt Vesuvius; the tower is painted Pompeian red; and, fittingly, the whole thing looks like it could be buried by a wave and swept out to sea at any moment.\n\nD\u2019Oriano didn\u2019t sleep much his first few months on duty. Pounding storms frequently brought waves 25m up to his bedroom window, and gale-force winds caused the lighthouse tower to shake and sway.\n\n\u201cAt first, I thought these tremors were small earthquakes,\u201d D\u2019Oriano remembered, flipping through old diaries in his office. \u201cBut over the years, I\u2019ve learned that an angry sea is more beautiful than a quiet sea. It reminds you that nature exists and that this mass of water is open and alive. Only someone who lives in solitude can understand this.\u201d\n\nWhen D\u2019Oriano arrived at the lighthouse, two older guardians shared the small keepers quarters below the tower with him. They used to take turns going up and down the tower, shared a kitchen and tiny bathroom together and played cards together outside as the beams quietly flashed through the night. When they retired in 2009, their positions closed with them, leaving D\u2019Oriano to keep the 1,000-watt light, maintain the grounds and pass the time all alone.\n\nThese days, when he\u2019s not fixing electrical issues, communicating with the Coast Guard and emptying buckets of seawater from the stairwell, D\u2019Oriano listens to classical music and reads plays by Italian dramatist Luigi Pirandello in the lantern room. In the evenings, he writes poems about the ocean, its fishermen and the constellations. At night, he paints watercolour seascapes and plays guitar on the cots in the empty rooms where the other keepers once lived.\n\nEach autumn, he looks for the bottlenose dolphins and sperm whales that appear offshore. In the summer, he picks wild mushrooms and asparagus in a nearby pine forest; and in the spring, he plants tomatoes, basil, beans and \u201cwhatever the seagulls don\u2019t eat\u201d in a small garden by the lighthouse\u2019s front door.\n\nIn the nine years since the lighthouse\u2019s other keepers left, D\u2019Oriano has barely taken a day off. Even when his knee was replaced, he still hobbled up and down the tower twice a day on crutches to monitor the coast and flash his handheld torch back at the sailors who signal him each night from across the darkness in a sort of mariner\u2019s Morse code.\n\n\u201cA machine can power a light, but it can\u2019t watch the sea,\u201d D\u2019Oriano insisted. \u201cA human presence provides an added sense of comfort and security for navigators, and it\u2019s fundamental in case something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nJudging by D\u2019Oriano\u2019s diary entries, a lot can go wrong.\n\n\u201c19 August 2016, 10:10: Saw a motorboat on fire and five people jump overboard. Notified Coast Guard for sea rescue. All brought to safety.\u201d\n\n\u201c7 June 2015, 6:10: Awoke to screams in the direction of Tombosiello. Coordinated helicopter search operations, which found a live body near Cala di Limmo.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Oriano has also responded to distress flares, gas spills and shipwrecks. And on 7 February 2013 at 21:05, lightning struck Punta Carena, setting fire to the tower and D\u2019Oriano\u2019s apartment below.\n\n\u201cI raced up and down the stairs in my pyjamas, saw that flames were engulfing everything and quickly put them out,\u201d D\u2019Oriano said. \u201cWe were able to get the lighthouse working three days later, but I lived in the darkness with candles for the next five months.\u201d\n\nDespite recent protests from the Capri chapter of the National Sailors Association of Italy, the Italian military is continuing its plans to transform Punta Carena into an unmanned, tele-monitored outpost. The navy recently installed a control panel in Punta Carena\u2019s lantern room to automate the light, and starting in January, a SIM card is supposed to send a text message to the navy\u2019s command centre in Naples if something stops working.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Punta Carena and that entire area is a \u2018shadow zone\u2019,\u201d said Antonino Terminello, a captain who\u2019s been sailing off Capri\u2019s south-western coast for the last 16 years. \u201cThere\u2019s no mobile signal, no GPS, nothing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for someone inside to constantly maintain and monitor everything.\u201d\n\nMy heart is here\n\nAfter hardly leaving the island for 13 years, D\u2019Oriano can no longer afford to stay. Like so many other stunning seaside properties in Capri, there are talks of transforming his apartment and the empty keeper\u2019s quarters at Punta Carena into a luxury resort. In the last few months, D\u2019Oriano has been setting aside part of his \u20ac1,300 monthly salary to buy a small plot of land somewhere quiet in the countryside. He says he\u2019d like to try painting landscapes and hopes to one day publish some of his poems. But he can\u2019t bring himself to pack up his lighthouse home quite yet.\n\n\u201cMy heart is here,\u201d D\u2019Oriano said, watching the bright beams streak across the night sky. \u201cWhen I can no longer keep the light, I think part of me will turn off too.\u201d\n\nCustom Made is a BBC Travel series that introduces you to custodians of cultural traditions all around the world.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

  "text": "Fresh from the factory, Britain\u2019s latest hi-tech train glints under the powerful lights of the depot. With its aerodynamic nose-cone and sleek racing-green carriages, the machine stretches into the far distance.\n\n\u201cThis is a very different train to the 40-year old trains it\u2019s replacing,\u201d says Sam Fisk from manufacturer Hitachi, and our guide to the North Star depot near London\u2019s Paddington Station. \u201cWe\u2019ve imported technology from Japan and our design centre has made sure the train is shaped so it cuts through the air.\u201d\n\nSome 200 of these Class 800 hybrid units \u2013 capable of running on both overhead power and diesel \u2013 will eventually replace Britain\u2019s 40-year-old High Speed Trains. They recently made their debut on the line between London and the west of England and will soon be rolled out on the East Coast Main Line to Scotland. That line is a route made famous by world record-breaking steam engines such as the Flying Scotsman and 126 mile-an-hour Mallard.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nInside, the train has that new car smell with unblemished rows of spotless seating. At the front is a futuristic cab with computer screens and arrays of switches, looking like it was transplanted from a Space Shuttle cockpit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a digital train,\u201d says Fisk. \u201cDrivers came in to test the design, so it\u2019s single comfortable seat at the centre and even has a handy cup holder.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all very well, but where you have drinks you eventually need toilets. What are they like?\n\nSince the end of the 19th Century \u2013 and in the US even earlier \u2013 most long-distance trains have been fitted with toilets. They\u2019re a necessity for any long-distance journey but most passengers do their best to avoid them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been terrible toilet design,\u201d says railway author and historian Christian Wolmar, who\u2019s travelled the world by rail. \u201cThey range from the very basic on Indian railways \u2013 where\u2019s it\u2019s not much more than a hole in the floor \u2013 to modern toilets, which have the dodgy trick of the door opening by itself.\u201d\n\nAh, yes\u2026 the self-opening toilet door. Anyone who has ever used a British train toilet has almost certainly experienced the excruciating horror and embarrassment of the automatic door slowly rolling open for fellow passengers.\n\nI can\u2019t understand why the design is so difficult and complicated \u2013 Christian Wolmar\n\nThe problem is down to the design of the buttons, and complicated instructions (in English only), requiring users to press one button to close the door and then another to lock it. To make things even more confusing, the switches are often back to front.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only issue with train toilet design\u2026\n\n\u201cThey tend to have a completely unfathomable system for the sink \u2013 the water comes out, air comes out and soap comes out all from different bits hidden under a shelf,\u201d says Wolmar. \u201cInevitably you turn on the hot air before the water - I can\u2019t understand why the design is so difficult and complicated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s issues like this that the designers of the new high-speed trains were told to address. With the trains commissioned almost 10 years ago, they\u2019ve had plenty of time to get it right.\n\n\u201cThe government set the specifications and one of the feedbacks was that the standard of the toilets had to be raised from the earlier fleets,\u201d says Fisk. \u201cWe built a wooden mock-up of the whole train and have had more than 200 groups of passengers on board to give us feedback \u2013 then we went to the factory and built the real trains based on what they said.\u201d\n\nSo, did the people get what they asked for? BBC Future decided to put this \u201cbetter\u201d train toilet to the test.\n\nWe\u2019ve made sure the locking system is a lever and you have to push that lever to the right \u2013 Sam Fisk\n\nEach train has five toilets on board \u2013 three are similar in size to aircraft toilets and two are designed to fit a wheelchair and include a fold-down baby changing bench. We chose to investigate one of those.\n\nFirst impressions are good - the toilet is spacious, clean and well-lit, with grey and cream walls. It even has inset wooden panels and two coat hooks.\n\n\u201cWe made sure that we had wheelchair users come in here, you can turn a wheelchair, we also had people with guide dogs and people with babies,\u201d says Fisk. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the spaces and angles are right.\u201d\n\nSo, onto test one: locking the door.\n\n\u201cBeing able to lock the door was the number one feedback,\u201d says Fisk. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure the locking system is a lever and you have to push that lever to the right.\u201d\n\nA red sign lights up and a woman announces from a hidden speaker that \u201cThe door is locked.\u201d\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nWe tried to simulate a hotel toilet \u2013 it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s bright \u2013 Sam Fisk\n\nNext, the toilet itself. All seems to be in order \u2013 there\u2019s toilet paper within easy reach and the bowl flushes with considerable power. So forceful in fact that rumour has it Nasa was inspired by bullet train toilet design for the International Space Station.\n\nToilet waste goes into a tank under the train. Like many others around the world, some older trains in the UK still dump waste directly onto the tracks. \u201cDo not flush in the station\u201d signs are, apparently, largely ignored.\n\nFinally, the basin - a pushbutton arrangement that might not entirely please Wolmar but seems to function well enough.\n\nThis new train toilet is hardly revolutionary but it goes a long way to addressing flaws in train toilet design. \u201cWe tried to simulate a hotel toilet \u2013 it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s bright,\u201d says Fisk, \u201cwe wanted to bring a nice feel to the place.\u201d\n\nOut on the mainline, the new Hitachi trains have had a number of teething problems. Passengers report hard seating, leaking air conditioning and issues with onboard catering and timekeeping. One train recently broke down completely, leaving hundreds stranded for six hours.\n\nStill, at least the toilets are well designed.\n\n--\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

  "title": "Is this the end for real fur?",
  "url": "http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20181004-how-fashion-fell-in-love-with-faux-fur",
  "text": "London Fashion Week recently became the first global fashion week to ban animal fur. Campaigners were euphoric. In the past year, fur has faced significant challenges everywhere, but still \u2013 it was quite a moment. Then, a few weeks later, Los Angeles voted to ban the manufacture and sale of fur within city limits, becoming the largest American city to do so. Has fur \u2013 fashion\u2019s most controversial material \u2013 finally had its day?\n\nIt certainly looks like it. Week after week, another luxury house is ditching it. Burberry, now helmed by Riccardo Tisci, made its stand just a day before the British Fashion Council event; Gucci, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, John Galliano, Maison Margiela, Jimmy Choo and Versace within the past two years. Stella McCartney, undisputed queen of green luxury, has of course been fur-free from the start.\n\nLast June, luxury online behemoth Yoox Net-a-Porter, which sells to some of fur\u2019s biggest consumers such as China, announced it was going fur-free \u2013 citing customer feedback. \u201cDo you think using furs today is still modern?\u201d Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri asked eager students at the London College of Fashion in October 2017. \u201cI don't think so. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re not doing it.\u201d For an industry that prides itself on being buzzy and on-the-ball, Bizzarri\u2019s statement was a death knell for real fur.\n\nPeople don't want to see [real] fur; it\u2019s come to symbolise a selfishness they don\u2019t want to endorse \u2013 Wendy Higgins\n\nAbout time too. From wild trapping to the horrors of a Chinese fur market, where live skinning is par for the course, nothing about fur production is easy. Films such as Klatki have uncovered the devastating lives of animals on European fur farms. \u201cFur is immoral, cruel and barbaric \u2013 it is an industry that capitalises on death,\u201d says a call-to-action on McCartney\u2019s website. As one look at the small, traumatised creatures in Klatki will demonstrate, she\u2019s not exaggerating.\n\nWhy is fashion moving so fast to distance itself from fur now? \u201cIncreasingly, consumers expect brands to demonstrate social responsibility, sustainability and animal welfare; the fur-free movement is part of that zeitgeist,\u201d says Wendy Higgins, media director for Humane Society International. \u201cPeople don't want to see fur; it\u2019s come to symbolise a selfishness they don\u2019t want to endorse. That realisation by designers like Gucci has created a domino effect.\u201d\n\nNone of this comes as a surprise to Kym Canter, ex-creative director of ultra-glam label J Mendel, self-confessed former fur addict and now director of her own ethical faux-fur company, House of Fluff. \u201cI switched teams,\u201d she laughs. \u201cSome of my favourite coats were so glamorous, and then, one day I thought, this is insane, I\u2019m an animal lover and I\u2019m wearing garments that don\u2019t match my morals.\u201d\n\nBut finding stylish alternatives proved tricky so, fresh from a luxury background, Canter decided to make her own: \u201cHouse of Fluff is about faking something you\u2019d respond to as rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\u201d Her coats \u2013 slinky leopard print trenches, soft \u2018Mongolian lamb\u2019 boleros, \u2018Teddy\u2019 bombers \u2013 are impossibly luxurious, about as far away from scratchy high street shagpiles as you can get. Think Anita Pallenberg in her heyday \u2013 without the cruelty.\n\nEthical luxury\n\nFor Hannah Weiland, founder of British-based technicolour faux-fur label Shrimps, the standard of new faux is the key to its longevity. \u201cWhen I launched in 2013, there weren\u2019t any high-quality options,\u201d she remembers. \u201cAs soon as people felt our faux, they were impressed. And that makes the argument for real fur much harder.\u201d Plus, this is fashion made to last. \u201cThese are coats you\u2019re going to wear for multiple seasons, even pass down,\u201d says Canter. \u201cThey\u2019re luxe products.\u201d\n\nIndeed they are. All those newly fur-free luxury houses are embracing faux with a passion, elevating both design standards and materials. MM6 Maison Margiela's oversized shaggy coat in a rich teal is a keeper; as is McCartney\u2019s autumn/winter 2018 textured beige wrap. And no one is going to forget Cara Delevingne marching down the runway in Burberry\u2019s faux fur rainbow cape, outgoing creative director Christopher Bailey\u2019s swansong on February\u2019s autumn/winter catwalk.\n\nBut campaigners can\u2019t rest on their laurels just yet. For all its animal-friendly credentials, most faux is made from modacrylic, a derivative of oil and synthetics. This means that, like other petroleum-based products, it pollutes during production, releases microfibres on washing and won\u2019t biodegrade. The pro-fur lobby, which is big and powerful, take great joy in going on about this, citing fur as the only genuinely sustainable option.\n\nToday\u2019s best faux-fur designers are making real efforts to help the planet\n\nMeanwhile, consumers keen to do the right thing are left at a loss: go faux for the animals \u2013 or go real for the planet? No contest, says Higgins. \u201cAll materials we use in fashion have some kind of eco-footprint \u2013 including fur,\u201d she points out. \u201cAnd the impact of fur production can't be overstated, from CO2 emissions and manure runoff on fur farms, to the cocktail of chemicals used in fur dressing and dyeing. Fur is far from earth-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get distracted,\u201d adds Canter. \u201cThere are loads of studies showing that real fur is actually much more harmful to the environment than faux. The fur industry has a billion dollars to spend on advertising. They\u2019re smart, they\u2019re worried and they have a lot of people crafting [its] message. So far, it\u2019s been extremely effective.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, today\u2019s best faux-fur designers are making real efforts to help the planet. Canter\u2019s brand works with organic and sustainable materials wherever possible, and makes everything locally; its edgy flagship in New York\u2019s Bowery is built from upcycled materials. Reusable fabric garment bags are made from by a women\u2019s cooperative in El Salvador. Ditto Stella McCartney, whose offices and factories consider all aspects of environmental impact.\n\nFor those still twitchy about faux\u2019s eco-credentials, however, options are emerging. For autumn/winter 2018, sustainable Brit pioneers Vin & Omi finished their show with a big, bouncy coat made from the combed-out raw fleeces of 10 pet llamas who are still gambolling about their smallholdings today. \u201cWe wanted to include raw fleece as it has an incredible softness,\u201d says OmI. \u201cAnd we wanted the audience to appreciate that high-end fashion can be eco and wearable.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s biotech, increasingly being used to find lab-friendly alternatives to animals in food, fashion and beyond, says Mina Jugovic at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion. She cites as examples the living-moss collars by London College of Fashion student Tara Baoth Mooney \u2013 \u201cHer moss pelts promote the concept of \u2018symbiotic biomimicry\u201d \u00ad\u2013 and Ashleigh Chambers, who is currently working on a biodegradable faux fur with a new cellulose fibre created from rose bushes.\n\nMeanwhile, designer Ingvar Helgason at BioFur\u2019s lab-grown pelts are created from stem-cells while, at the Faux Fur Institute, founded by Arnaud Brunois in retort to claims by the International Fur Federation, researchers are developing a fibre made from 40 per cent plant-based ingredients, to reduce faux\u2019s dependency on petroleum-based product, as well as safe methods to recycle faux fur and ways to turn synthetics into energy.\n\nIn New York, Canter is working with chemists to create an \u201ceven more Earth-friendly faux fur\u201d. \u201cAt the level of the threads and the textile,\u201d she says, eagerly. \u201cWe want to have that ready to come to market in a year. We\u2019re super committed to this. Faux can be made from plant-friendly, animal-friendly ingredients \u2013 and we\u2019re working on it.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",

  "title": "Film review: Five stars for Roma",
  "url": "http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20181009-film-review-five-stars-for-roma",
  "text": "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma is beautiful in every way. From the subtle artistry of its black-and-white images to its personal yet universal story about a young servant, Cleo.\n\nSet in Mexico City in 1970-71, the film is dedicated to a woman named Libo, the real-life inspiration for Cleo, a nanny and maid for a middle-class family based on the director\u2019s own. Roma is the name of the neighbourhood in which he grew up and where the film was shot. But those autobiographical details are less important than the emotion that thoroughly infuses the film: Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s deep affection and respect for Cleo, and for a time and place that means home.\n\n- Film review: Venom\n\n- Film review: A Star is Born\n\n- Film review: Five stars for First Man\n\nThe film begins with a shot of square paving stones in the family driveway, viewed from above so that the stones are seen as a pattern of diamond shapes. One of the few purely impressionistic images, it suggests Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s method: transforming something ordinary, so that it is seen in a fresh way. Water begins to flow over the stones, and finally the camera is back on the ground, where Cleo is washing the drive.\n\nShe is beloved by the four children in the family, quietly whispering \u201cWake up, my angel,\u201d when she gets them out of bed in the morning. But Cuar\u00f3n clearly defines her role as a servant, who shares a room adjoining the house with another maid, and works tirelessly. She can enjoy watching television with the family, but has to leave to make tea whenever the father wants it. Like so many in her position, she both is and is not quite one of them.\n\nThe children have yet to learn that their family is in distress. Their father pretends he is going on a business trip, but is really leaving their mother for another woman. Throughout the film, Marina de Tavira eloquently portrays the mother\u2019s strength and the pain she tries to hide.\n\nBut that story is a backdrop to Cleo\u2019s. She is played flawlessly by Yalitza Aparicio, who had never acted before. The camera often stays on Cleo\u2019s face, and Aparicio displays the layers of emotion that the character grapples with as she finds herself pregnant, then abandoned by her boyfriend.\n\nMore than in most films, Roma\u2019s distinctive style is inseparable from viewers\u2019 experience of it. Cuar\u00f3n evokes the classic works of Italian neorealism, such as Bicycle Thieves. His black-and-white is a naturalistic range of greys, not the deep-black, enhanced shades of film noir. Shooting in large-scale 65mm, he takes a wide view of most scenes as the camera stands back, sometimes panning slowly from left to right. There are no cheap editorial cuts and gestures that tell viewers what to watch, much less what to feel. Amazingly, he creates a sense that we are observing a world, even as he draws us into the lives of people who seem as real as anyone we might meet. The smaller the screen, the more the breadth of that world is likely to be diminished.\n\nThe moments of everyday naturalism are affecting. Cleo\u2019s boyfriend leaves her at the cinema, walking out without telling her that he won\u2019t return. After, she sits alone on the curb of the noisy street outside the theatre, clutching the jacket he left behind. Her face registers confusion and dismay, but not self-pity. This is a world without melodrama.\n\nHigh drama is handled by the characters with equanimity, as Cuar\u00f3n creates glorious, complex images that may, without context, sound precious, but in the film play as realistic details. During Cleo\u2019s appointment with a doctor at a hospital, a minor earthquake rumbles. She calmly observes the rubble that has landed on top of a baby\u2019s incubator. (Cuar\u00f3n makes it clear that the baby is still breathing.) During the family\u2019s New Year\u2019s visit with relatives, a fire breaks out in the woods, and the entire group, including the children, throw buckets of water on the fire as if it were a holiday game.\n\nChildren of Men was Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s one true masterpiece until now\n\nCuar\u00f3n doesn\u2019t ignore the political turmoil of the 70s, but lets it appear as it would to the characters. The children\u2019s grandmother takes Cleo to a furniture shop to buy a cot for her baby, a sign of how the family has embraced her. Outside the window, pro-democracy students are demonstrating, and paramilitary troops shoot and kill many, reenacting a historical event that became known as the Corpus Christi Massacre.\n\nBut the life-changing events are personal. Using his trademark long scenes (in Gravity, his famous uninterrupted opening is 17 minutes long) Cuar\u00f3n builds tension by letting those episodes take their time. When Cleo goes into labour, she is seen on the hospital table in the foreground, while doctors examine her baby in the background, the parallel images allowing us to observe her face as well as the action behind her. In another tense sequence, the family goes to the beach and two of the children are carried too far out in the water. Cleo, who can\u2019t swim, must try to save them.\n\nBy the time the family huddles together to hug Cleo near the end, she has emerged as both an ordinary woman and an extraordinary screen heroine, resilient and unsentimental.\n\nCuar\u00f3n is known for the variety of his style, from the early, sexy comedy Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the best of the Potter franchise. The Oscar-winning Gravity is sterile and overrated, but his dystopian Children of Men is truly brilliant. It was his one true masterpiece until now. Cuar\u00f3n not only directed Roma, he also wrote, edited and was cinematographer. Like a magician, he has taken his own memories, turned them into a dazzling fiction, and handed them to viewers like a gift.\n\nIt would be hard for any film to live up to the extravagant praise that has trailed this one from the Venice, Toronto and New York film festivals, but that acclaim \u2013 unlikely enough for a subtitled black-and-white film that is 2 hours and 15 minutes long \u2013 isn\u2019t hype. Roma is simply the most exquisite and artistic film of the year.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

  "text": "This story is from an episode of Business Matters from the BBC World Service. To listen to more episodes, please click here.\n\nFor the last 11 years, I\u2019ve written a workplace advice column, answering people\u2019s letters on everything from how to tell a manager your workload is too high to what to do about a colleague who smells.\n\nOne of the biggest themes I\u2019ve seen in my mail in that time is that a lot of people want to know \u2013 how do I get my boss or my colleague to change their behavior without me actually having to talk to them about it? In other words, an awful lot of us are hoping that there will be some sort of magical spell that will let us solve problems without ever having to use our words. People really want to avoid direct conversations, especially if there\u2019s any potential for awkwardness.\n\nTo some extent, it\u2019s understandable. After all, your job is your livelihood, and you need to remain on good terms with your colleagues \u2013 and especially with your boss \u2013 or your life can become much less pleasant. But what I see in my mail is that people shy away from even minor conversations that are highly unlikely to end badly.\n\nI\u2019ve heard from people who stew in silence for months rather than asking a colleague to please stop taking all their calls on speakerphone\n\nFor example, I\u2019ve heard from people who stew in silence for months rather than asking a colleague to please stop taking all their calls on speakerphone, or to turn down a loud cellphone ring. I\u2019ve heard from people who spend way too long tolerating physically uncomfortable working conditions \u2013 like a painful chair or an air freshener that literally nauseates them \u2013 rather than have a quick conversation with the person who could fix it. I\u2019ve even heard from people \u2013 multiple people \u2013 who end up doing work long after they leave a job \u2013 for free \u2013 because they\u2019re so hesitant to say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t something I can help with anymore.\u201d Or even, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what payment rate makes sense for this work.\u201d\n\nAnd even managers, who have the clear authority to speak up when they want something to change, can be some of the worst offenders when it comes to shying away from direct conversation. My mail is full of letters from managers who are frustrated with some aspect of an employee\u2019s work but haven\u2019t actually sat down with the person and told them what they want to see change\u2026 even though doing that is their job!\n\nThe idea is to speak up calmly and matter-of-factly \u2013 in a tone similar to the one that you\u2019d use to say \u2018I can\u2019t seem to get this software to work\u2019\n\nWhile certainly no one looks forward to a conversation that might be awkward or uncomfortable, the reality is that you\u2019ll get far better results in your professional life \u2013 and usually have far better quality of life at work \u2013 if you\u2019re willing to speak up and ask for what you want. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean speaking up in an aggressive or adversarial way, which seems to be what people sometimes imagine they\u2019d have to do. Instead, the idea is to speak up calmly and matter-of-factly \u2013 in a tone similar to the one that you\u2019d use to say \u201cI can\u2019t seem to get this software to work\u201d or \u201ccould you help me solve this problem with a client?\u201d In other words, it\u2019s the tone you\u2019d use if you were trying to solve any other work-related problem and you been stewing to yourself for weeks about it.\n\nIf you do that, you\u2019re likely to find that most people are reasonable. Most people want to know if they\u2019re doing something that\u2019s aggravating you or making you unhappy \u2013 or in the case of that air freshener, making you physically ill. Most people won\u2019t be upset that you initiated a calm, polite conversation about what you need, and you\u2019re not going to come across as a jerk to reasonable people.\n\nOf course, not everyone is reasonable \u2013 but most people are, and if you try it, the conversation is far more likely than not to go well and get you the outcome you want.\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

  "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nEuropean stocks have fallen sharply as concerns about a trade war and higher US bond yields have stoked concerns among global investors.\n\nIn London, the UK's FTSE 100 share index fell 1.7% to 7,023.\n\nMarkets in Asia had plunged to a 19-month low after US shares suffered their worst losses in eight months.\n\nUS President Donald Trump called the falls a \"correction\", but said the Federal Reserve, which has been raising interest rises, had \"gone crazy\".\n\nThe global sell-off came as International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said stock market valuations have been \"extremely high\".\n\nIn Paris, the Cac 40 share index was down 1.7% at 5,119 points, while in Frankfurt the Dax index fell 1.3% to 11,559.\n\nThe FTSE 100 and the Cac 40 have fallen to their lowest levels since April, while the Dax is at its lowest since early 2017.\n\nMarkets in Asia had followed US stocks, which slumped on Wednesday.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 3.9%, its steepest daily drop since March. In China, the Shanghai Composite fell 5.2% to its lowest level since 2014.\n\nWhy are the markets falling?\n\nby Dominic O'Connell, BBC Today business presenter\n\nFor the past year, stock market experts have been predicting a big fall. It was something of an obvious forecast; most markets are at or near all-time highs, particularly in America, where investors have enjoyed the longest bull run ever.\n\nWhat goes up must come down - the only question was the timing. In the last year, there have been even more signs of so-called \"melt-up\" phase of a bull market, where share price increases are concentrated in just a few very large companies. Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have accounted for most of the increase in the US markets in the past 12 months.\n\nThe trigger for the latest fall has been a sudden flight from American government debt.\n\nInvestors have started to sell down US government bonds - the IOUs it issues to fund its deficit - thinking that they are no longer a good value investment. This has in turn triggered a bout of realism on the stock market.\n\nWorries about a trade war have added to this new mood of caution, and it is worth noting that yesterday several big US companies warned that tariffs on Chinese imports were starting to hurt their business.\n\nOne oddity of this particular market drop; traditional safe havens, like gold and, perversely, US government debt, have hardly moved in price. This suggests investors are uncertain of what next - a big fall or another rally - and are happy to sit on cash.\n\nTrump attacks 'crazy' Fed\n\nUS markets have done better than expected this year, bouncing back after turmoil early in the year to set new records over the summer.\n\nBut the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, with the latest hike coming last month, and more increases are likely to come.\n\nThe Fed last month abandoned its description of its policy as \"accommodative\", reflecting a view that the economy is strong enough not to need the kind of stimulus it received in the after-math of the financial crisis.\n\nThe prospect of dwindling US stimulus has been compounded by a trade war between the world's two largest economy - which the IMF has warned could harm growth.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has been particularly critical of the Fed's rate rises, breaking with tradition in the US where presidents are expected to respect central bank independence.\n\n\"The Fed is making a mistake,\" he told reporters on Wednesday. \"I think the Fed has gone crazy.\"\n\nCorrection 'well-overdue'\n\nHowever, analyst Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said it was \"too simplistic just to blame the Federal Reserve\" for market turmoil.\n\n\"There are a number of factors,\" he told the BBC. \"Obviously, concerns about slowing growth - the IMF downgraded its global growth forecast for the global economy, citing emerging market concerns,\" he said.\n\nMr Hewson added that trade tensions between China and the US had weighed on Asian markets for most of this year, while trade tensions between the US and the EU had hit European markets. Concerns about the political situation in Italy were also adding to market nervousness.\n\n\"It's a well-overdue correction, driven by US markets, which have out-performed for most of the past two to three years,\" he added.\n\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, told the BBC that what was \"really quite interesting is the speed with which the sell-off is taking place\", adding that there has been a pattern over the past few years of markets hitting new highs followed by sharp drops.\n\nHe added: \"When you've got the president of the US saying some quite unpleasant things about the Federal Reserve... you don't necessarily expect it in the US.\"\n\n\"That's made investors say 'Given those gains, we'll bank some of them, [and] take money off the table'.\"",

  "text": "Image copyright SIA\n\nThe battle to offer the world's longest non-stop flight steps up a gear on Thursday, when a new Singapore-to-New York service takes off.\n\nSingapore Airlines is relaunching the service five years after they withdrew it because it had become too expensive.\n\nIt will cover more than 15,000km and is scheduled to take just under 19 hours.\n\nQantas launched a 17-hour non-stop service from Perth to London earlier this year, while Qatar runs a 17.5-hour service between Auckland and Doha.\n\nHave passengers been snapping up the tickets?\n\nThe flight from Changi Airport to Newark's international airport in New Jersey will be taking off amid much fanfare and with barely a seat to spare.\n\nSingapore Airlines (SIA) said there was demand for customers for non-stop services which help cut travelling times compared with flights which have a stopover.\n\nThe airline told the BBC that business class seats for the flight were fully booked.\n\nHowever, there were \"a very limited number\" of premium economy seats left.\n\nThe airline is not planning to offer any economy bookings on the route.\n\nA business class ticket will entitle passengers to two meals, and the choice of when they are served, plus refreshments in between. They will also have a bed to sleep in.\n\nPremium economy fares will get three meals at fixed times, with refreshments in between.\n\nDo people want to fly for 19 hours?\n\nThe brand new Airbus plane that SIA is using has been configured to seat 161 passengers in all - 67 business passengers and 94 premium economy passengers.\n\n\"The thinking behind that is that they are selling a premium product - it's for the top end of town,\" says aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, who will be on board Thursday's flight.\n\n\"This is a route between two massive financial hubs, and so they will fill this plane up with business people, or well-heeled travellers who want the convenience of a non stop flight.\n\n\"It's also been proven that when carriers introduce a new non-stop route, the traffic on that route increases threefold.\"\n\nMr Thomas, the editor-in-chief of airline rating site Airlineratings.com, has been on several such inaugural flights, including Qantas' new long-haul from Perth to London, inaugurated earlier this year, and he says he is looking forward to being a part of history.\n\n\"The Qantas flight to London was a huge event. We were basically on our feet for the entire flight, it was incredibly exciting. There's almost a party atmosphere on board.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Qantas is using a 787-9 Dreamliner for its Perth to London route\n\nQantas meanwhile is in advanced discussions with Airbus and Boeing over an aircraft capable of making a 20-hour flight between London and Sydney.\n\nThe Australian national flag carrier also plans to fly non-stop from Australia to North America - slightly shorter than the London-Sydney non-stop flight.\n\nBut Max Kingsley-Jones, group editor of Flight Global, warned that plans for new non-stop routes had a habit of changing in line with the economics of the world.\n\n\"In the boom times you get a lot of what we call direct-connect flights between smaller cities\u2026 [then] each time there's a downturn you see all those tail off, and then we go back to people flying over hubs,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\n\"Even though it costs more for an airline to fly over a hub, they'll always charge you less because of the disadvantage of going via somewhere else.\"\n\nWhich route will the flight take?\n\nOf two possible routes that SIA could take on Thursday to Newark, SIA has already told its passengers which one it will take - the NOPAC route, or the North Pacific route.\n\nMr Thomas says it will cover a distance of some 15,341km, but reminds non-aviation experts that while the distance between destinations remains constant, the distance flown and flight times can vary because of tailwinds, headwinds and any need for weather-related diversions.\n\n\"When you've got some good strong jet streams going in an easterly direction, which is the way we'll go, then we will fly over Japan, then over the North Pacific, possibly touching into Alaska, then down through Canada into Newark.\"\n\nAt the moment, SIA is estimating the flight will take around 18 hours and 25 minutes.\n\nImage copyright SIA Image caption Business class seating on Singapore Airline's new A350-900 ULR - the flight will not offer any economy seating\n\nIs this the future of long-haul travel?\n\nThe A350-900 ULR (ultra-long-range) that will fly on Thursday from Singapore to Newark belongs to Airbus' family of long-range, twin-engine aircraft.\n\nThe planes have been designed to replace Boeing's older 777 series and use between 20% and 30% less fuel than the 777s did - which is a good thing amid rising oil prices.\n\nSingapore Airlines launched the same non-stop route between Changi and Newark in 2004, but by 2013 the carrier was forced to cancel it. The A340-500 it was using at the time used a lot of fuel and eventually the route became too expensive to run.\n\nSeveral carriers already use the newer A350-900s on their long-haul routes. They have higher ceilings, larger windows and lighting designed to reduce jetlag - all good things for busy business travellers.\n\nBut the ultra-long-range version that SIA has bought from Airbus has the longest capability of any aircraft flying today, thanks in part to a slightly modified fuel system.\n\nIt can fly for 20 hours non-stop, which most aviation experts will tell you is the future of very long-haul travel for business and pleasure.\n\nMr Thomas says it's been proven over and over again that people want to fly non-stop, \"so these sorts of aeroplanes are set to gain terrific momentum\".\n\n\"Qantas' flight from Perth to London is seeing a load factor in economy of 92% - and in premium it's 94%. So from an airline perspective, these routes are money-making.\n\n\"We really are entering a new era of travel.\"",

  "text": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Imported goods could suffer supply constraints, says the OBR\n\nAn \"abrupt and disorderly\" Brexit could have a severe short-term impact on the UK economy and public finances, the country's fiscal watchdog has warned.\n\nIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it could lead to shortages and hoarding of some imported products, said the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nThe OBR said the lack of precedents for Brexit made the effect hard to predict.\n\nBut it noted that 1974's Three-Day Week prompted by miners' industrial action caused a 3% fall in quarterly output.\n\nThe OBR said weaker economic activity and higher prices could result from a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe OBR said if there was no agreement on standards everything would have to be resubmitted for approval: \"In a scenario where the UK and EU are unable to agree to the continued mutual recognition ('grandfathering') of existing product standards and professional qualifications, all existing goods may need to be re-approved before sale and services trade would be severely restricted by the loss of market access.\"\n\nIt said this would lead to bottlenecks of goods while they wait for new approvals. It also warned about the risk of grounding of British aircraft not being able to fly, should no agreement be made.\n\n'Three-day week'\n\nIt said any stockpiling this prompted would only worsen the situation: \"Should these bottlenecks turn out to be significant, it might prompt households and businesses to attempt to stockpile goods in advance, further aggravating the shortages.\"\n\nThe OBR said it was \"next to impossible to calibrate with any confidence the potential impact of this sort of scenario in advance.\n\n\"However, while not a direct parallel, it is worth noting that the 'Three-Day Week', introduced in early 1974 in response to energy shortages and increased militancy on the part of the miners, was associated with a fall in output of a little under 3% that quarter.\"",

  "title": "How Amsterdam's canal boats are going electric - at a cost",
  "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45783085",
  "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption All of Amsterdam's boats must go electric by 2025\n\nAs we glide silently up Amsterdam's busy waterways on an unseasonably warm autumn morning, boat company owner Rik Kooij, 38, admits that \"canal water runs in my veins\".\n\nEver since his mechanically-minded grandfather renovated a bicycle, then a motorbike, then a boat back in the 1920s, Mr Kooij's family has been at the heart of Amsterdam's tourist canal boat business.\n\nThe Prinses Irene, which once took Winston Churchill up the canals, is silent because it's electric. All you hear is the swoosh of the water being churned up by the propeller. And there are no acrid diesel fumes to spoil the experience.\n\nWhen Mr Kooij had to take the helm of the family business following the sudden death of his father in 2013, he wasn't daunted because he'd been working the canals since he was a boy.\n\nImage caption The Prinses Irene was one of the first boats to be converted to electric\n\nNow the Reederij Kooij boat company he runs with his wife Daniela is one of the largest plying Amsterdam's famous canals. It owns 32 boats out of about 150 catering to the city's many tourists.\n\nBut when the municipality of Amsterdam stipulated that all boats would have to switch from diesel to electric power by 2025, in an effort to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, boat companies were faced with a huge - and expensive - challenge.\n\n\"We prefer to do everything that is good for the environment,\" says Mr Kooij diplomatically, \"but it is going to cost us millions of euros. Too much!\n\n\"But if we don't do it we won't get a permit to operate, so our boats will be just scrap metal.\"\n\nImage caption Amsterdam's canals were constructed in the 17th Century, circling the medieval city centre\n\nHe has converted six boats so far - it takes about three months to strip out the old diesel engine and install the electric engine and batteries. A typical 23m (75ft) tourist boat needs about 66 batteries, he says, making the conversion cost around 165,000 to 250,000 euros ($189,000 to $287,000; \u00a3145,000 to \u00a3220,000) per boat.\n\nBut the engines are quieter, cleaner and cheaper to run - boat companies should recoup their costs in about 12 years, according to the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate, a body supporting sustainable transport projects.\n\nThey can be recharged in about 10 hours and last about two days between charges, says Sigrid Hanekamp, an application engineer from Dutch battery company Lithium Werks, which supplied the batteries for Reederij Kooij's boats.\n\nThese batteries are not your typical lead-acid type traditionally used in cars, or even the type of lithium-ion ones becoming standard in electric vehicles, she explains. They're lithium-iron-phosphate, a chemistry Lithium Werks believes is more durable and environmentally friendly.\n\nImage caption Sigrid Hanekamp says Lithium Werks' batteries are more efficient than lead-acid batteries\n\nThey might not be as energy dense as some other types of battery, but they can be charged quickly and last longer than many other lithium-ion battery chemistries, the company says. And as they use iron rather than the much less plentiful cobalt, they're easier to produce and less prone to price fluctuations.\n\nBut isn't water and electricity a dangerous mix?\n\nArjan Kooijman, director of E-Ship, a firm that converts diesel boats to electric, says connected sensors on the batteries are constantly sending performance data back to the boat company's headquarters.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nSoftware monitors the health and charge of each battery. And if any water does get in to the insulated unit, a fuse blows, isolating it, and an alarm alerts the operator back at base.\n\n\"People used to think it was impossible to make a big ship electric 10 years ago, but we've shown that it can be done,\" says Mr Kooijman, whose company stands to do a brisk trade over the next few years.\n\nBy 2020, Amsterdam aims to have decreased energy consumption by 20% and increased use of renewable energy by the same percentage. The electrification of canal cruise boats is a significant part of this plan.\n\nImage caption Monitoring software tracks the performance of the boats in real time\n\nBut another challenge the boat companies face is installing enough dockside charging stations. Mr Kooij says he will have to stagger the charging rota, as it doesn't make commercial sense to have one charging station per boat.\n\nThis is where a two-day operating range and monitoring software comes in handy. If a boat skipper drives too fast - there's a 6km/h (4mph) speed limit on the internal canals - and drains the batteries too quickly, the software alerts headquarters, which then warns the skipper.\n\nAmsterdam has been a pioneer in low-carbon transport for many years. Back in 2009 the Lovers boat company launched the first tourist boat powered by hydrogen cells.\n\nImage copyright PortLiner Image caption Electric zero-emission container barges, like this artist's impression, could soon be plying Europe's canals\n\nThe Nemo H2 uses hydrogen and oxygen to create electricity - the only by-product is water vapour.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the Netherlands and Belgium announced a plan to launch zero-emissions, self-piloting container barges to sail from Amsterdam, Antwerp and Rotterdam. The barges could remove 23,000 lorries from the roads, claims Port Liner, the firm making the boats.\n\nWhile retrofitting canal boats with electric engines and batteries is a time-consuming and expensive task, Amsterdam is hoping the cleaner air and waterways will attract more tourists, be better for wildlife, and contribute to carbon emission reduction targets.",

  "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Increased production of fruit and vegetables will be needed if diets change\n\nIf the world wants to limit climate change, water scarcity and pollution, then we all need to embrace \"flexitarian\" diets, say scientists.\n\nThis means eating mainly plant-based foods, and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050, they say.\n\nFood waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve, according to the study.\n\nWithout action, the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90%.\n\nFast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet.\n\nThe authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change, depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Marco Springmann tells Today eating one portion of red meat a week could help tackle global warming\n\nThe study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050, these impacts could grow between 50-90%. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries, which the authors say represent a \"safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system\".\n\nHowever the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers, so a combined approach is needed.\n\nSo when it comes to climate change, the authors looked at what they called a \"flexitarian diet\".\n\n\"We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common, according to the latest scientific evidence, is that they are all relatively plant based,\" said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford.\n\n\"You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products, some might call it a Mediterranean based diet, we call it a flexitarian diet, over to a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet - we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one, but even this has only one serving of red meat per week.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Improved farming techniques and reduced use of fertiliser will be required\n\nIf the world moved to this type of diet, the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half.\n\nBut as well as altering diets, the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland, improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use.\n\n\"We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit, vegetables and legumes,\" said Dr Springmann.\n\n\"In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn, but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use, and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser - lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans.\"\n\nIn addition, the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16%.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cutting down on food waste will be key to reducing the environmental impacts of farming\n\n\"Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain, from storage, and transport, over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero-waste supply chains,\" said Fabrice de Clerck, director of science at EAT who funded the study.\n\nThe key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together.\n\n\"Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible - yet only if we change the way we eat, and the way we produce food,\" said Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who is one of the authors of the study.\n\n\"All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people.\"\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature.",

  "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nChildren get six to eight colds a year - twice as many as adults - but there's little evidence on what helps improve symptoms like blocked or runny noses and sneezing.\n\nSo are there remedies worth trying?\n\nPharmacies and supermarkets are full of cough and cold medicines which claim to relieve symptoms of the common cold.\n\nBut there is little evidence that many of them work, according to a BMJ review of trials on over-the-counter treatments.\n\nAnd some, like decongestants, are not suitable for babies, children or pregnant women.\n\nThe common cold can cause a sore throat, cough, congestion, a raised temperature and sneezing - all irritating symptoms - but after a week or so they should go away on their own.\n\nThe truth is there is no magic cure.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDoes anything help clear the nose?\n\nDr Rahul Chodhari, consultant paediatrician and spokesman for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says parents should try using saline nasal washes, also called nasal irrigation.\n\nThey can be bought over the counter in the form of drops or sprays.\n\nThe saltwater solution helps to clear the mucus from the nose and reduces the feeling of congestion.\n\n\"There are no side effects, it can be used many times a day and it's well proven to reduce swelling around the nose,\" Dr Chodhari says.\n\nApart from that, Calpol is useful for treating a fever - but it doesn't help relieve a blocked nose.\n\nImage copyright SPL\n\nWhat is not recommended?\n\nDecongestants are not suitable for children under 12, according to the NHS, because of the risk of side effects, like drowsiness and stomach upsets.\n\nAdults can use them for a maximum of three to seven days, but the BMJ research says they have \"a small effect on nasal symptoms\".\n\nThey can help ease blocked or stuffy noses by reducing the swelling or the blood vessels in the nose, which helps open up the airways.\n\nHowever, they also increase the risk of headaches and insomnia, among other side effects, and using them for too long can lead to chronic nasal congestion.\n\nDr Chodhari says cough syrups are not recommended because they stop children coughing up mucus and getting rid of it.\n\nAnd antibiotics only work against bacterial infections and so they do nothing to combat colds.\n\nVapour rubs and steam inhalation are not advised either, he says.\n\nWhat about home remedies?\n\nResearch on whether these kind of remedies work is really lacking.\n\nThe following ones have not been studied in children, or aren't effective, the BMJ research says:\n\nheated humidified air\n\nhumidified steam\n\nechinacea\n\nprobiotics\n\neucalyptus oil\n\nAccording to NHS UK, there is little evidence that supplements such as vitamin C, zinc or garlic prevent colds or speed up recovery.\n\nImage copyright Magnum Photos\n\nWhen do I go to my GP?\n\nMake an appointment to see your GP:\n\nif your child has a temperature of more than 38.5 degrees\n\ndevelops a rash which does not go away when a glass is pressed against it\n\nthe symptoms do not improve after a number of days\n\nAny other advice?\n\nStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and keep warm to help see off a cold.\n\nThe common cold is usually caused by viruses which are spread easily between people, especially small ones - particularly from coughs and sneezes.\n\nSo you can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands regularly in warm water and soap and not touching your eyes or nose in case you have come into contact with the virus.\n\nUse tissues to trap germs and bin them as quickly as possible.\n\nWe'd like to hear about your favourite remedies - join the debate on Facebook.",

Winds, tornadoes, flooding and a storm surge are all possible in the southeastern U.S. (Oct. 11) AP\n\nDamage from Hurricane Michael is seen in Panama City, Fla., Wednesday, Oct. 10, 2018. (Photo: Andrew West, USA TODAY Network)\n\nHurricane Michael weakened to tropical storm Thursday but remained a menace as it rolled across the Southeast, leaving two dead after tearing a path of devastation through the Florida Panhandle and parts of Georgia.\n\nThe storm will go down in history as the third strongest to hit the United States mainland in recorded history after making landfall Wednesday as a Category 4 colossus with sustained winds of 155 mph \u2014 just 2 mph short of iconic Category 5 status.\n\n\"I\u2019m urging residents of impacted areas to continue to stay off the roads and listen to your local authorities so that our first responders and utility crews can do their jobs,\" Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Thursday. \"We\u2019re working diligently to get to everyone as quickly as we can.\"\n\nWhere is the storm now?\n\nAs of 8 a.m. ET, the storm was centered 40 miles west of Columbia, South Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm was rolling northeast at 21 mph. A turn toward the east-northeast and an even faster forward speed are expected on Friday.\n\nWhat damage has Michael wrought?\n\nThousands of homes and businesses were blown apart as Michael cut its swath across the Florida Panhandle and into Georgia. An 80-mile stretch of I-10 west of Tallahassee was closed to clear debris. Beaches disappeared, military bases were damaged, cars and trucks were flipped and smashed. Power outages affected almost 700,000 customers in the two states alone. Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina reported more than 160,000 outages.\n\nWas the storm a record-breaker?\n\nMichael was the strongest storm to ever hit the Florida Panhandle, and the only hurricane to do so as a Category 4. It also was an October icon - the strongest continental United States hurricane to make an October landfall based on maximum sustained winds at 155 mph. And its low pressure \u2013 the lower the pressure the more severe the storm \u2013 also set an October record of 919 millibars.\n\nMore: Tropical Storm Michael menaces Southeast with heavy rain; 2 dead\n\nMore: Hurricane Michael: What you need to know in graphics\n\nMore: In a harrowing two hours, Hurricane Michael devastates Panama City\n\nWhat's next?\n\nRainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods in Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia. The center of Michael will move across central South Carolina this morning, then travel across portions of central and eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia this afternoon and this evening. The storm is set to move into the Atlantic Ocean by late tonight or early Friday.\n\nWhat is the death toll?\n\nThere are two reported deaths. A falling tree killed a man after it crashed into his home in Greensboro, Florida, authorities said. It trapped the resident, said Gadsden County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Anglie Hightower, and downed power lines and blocked roads made it hard for emergency crews to get to him.\n\nAn 11-year-old girl also died in Seminole County, Georgia, after a tree fell on a home, according to local emergency management officials.\n\nWhat are the estimated damages?\n\nIt's too early to tell for sure, but widespread roof damage and destruction across several states showed up on the Army Corps of Engineers' computer models. The Corps was preparing to cover tens of thousands of rooftops, according to a senior official. Accuweather predicted Michael's total damage and economic impact will reach close to $30 billion, which would make it one of the 10 costliest hurricanes in U.S. history.\n\nWhere did the storm make landfall?\n\nMichael made landfall at about 1:40 p.m. Wednesday near desolate Mexico Beach, Florida. That's about 20 miles southeast of Panama City, where dozens of utility poles were snapped and parking lots glistened with broken glass. Police officers spent the night patrolling the area to prevent looting and responding to calls for assistance, making do with damaged patrol cars eased across downed power lines and even small buildings flipped into the middle of streets.\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/10/11/michael-leaves-havoc-weakens-hurricane-tropical-storm/1598403002/",

The collapsing roof had cut the hotel\u2019s gas line.\n\nFor two hours, nobody could get outside to shut it off, nor could first responders get to the hotel. Smoking was forbidden, and guests crossed fingers that a spark wouldn\u2019t set off the gas.\n\n\u201cI tell you what, Scarlett, we got our lives, we got our lives,\u201d Charles Hickle told his wife. \u201cI believe that the next time, don\u2019t be a hero, leave.

  "text": "CLOSE Coastal properties took a beating as Hurricane Michael roared ashore along the Florida Panhandle. USA TODAY\n\nThe storm surge from Hurricane Michael pushes into the homes four hours prior to high tide on October 10, 2018 in the Florida Panhandle community of Shell Point Beach, Florida. (Photo: Mark Wallheiser, Getty Images)\n\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history blew away roofs and snapped trees with winds of up to 155 mph, just two short of a Category 5.\n\nAnd the news about Michael, now downgraded to a tropical storm, is about to get worse, as residents return to find their homes flooded by storm surge that reached 14 feet.\n\nThough a hurricane\u2019s power is typically measured by its winds, the storm surge is often just as destructive and even deadlier, accounting for about half the hurricane-related fatalities in the U.S. since 1970 and the majority of the 1,200 deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nFor folks dealing with flooding, what to do after the hurricane has passed can be as important as pre-storm preparations.\n\nHere are the key steps to take:\n\nTAKING CARE OF YOURSELF\n\n\"Make sure you're emotionally OK,\" said Elaina Sutley, assistant professor of structural engineering at the University of Kansas. \"Only then should you start assessing any structural damage.\"\n\nWhat materials do I need? Make sure you have knee-high rubber boots, rubber gloves, long-sleeve clothing, a respirator, a flashlight, a camera and liquid bleach.\n\nWhere do I start? Start by turning off any gas or power to prevent explosions or electrocution. Then begin drying out your home and addressing the structural damage such as a wall collapse or sinking ceilings. And remember: There may still be water left either in the basement or seeping from soaked furniture.\n\nAvoid coming in direct contact with any water, which may have been exposed to sewage, debris or dead animals. And let the house air out.\n\n\"You need to open up windows and doors. Let things dry out,\" Sutley said. Fans and dehumidifiers can help speed up the drying process.\n\nWhile everything dries, which can take a few days, homeowners are encouraged to throw out any food left in the home along with any absorbent material that has come in contact with water. And wash dinnerware, glasses and flatware before using them again.\n\n\"If there was saltwater flooding, there might be corrosion, so get an electrician to look at that,\" said Jeffrey Schlegelmilch of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. \"Even if it's not salt water, things could still be dangerous. Fact-check with a professional before plugging anything in.\"\n\nWhat do I do with damaged items? Coastal areas that have experienced floods in the past will likely have protocols for picking up and handling debris such as drywall and furniture.\n\nTo prevent the spread of mold and mildew, you may also have to remove flooring and insulation. Ideally, have a professional company do a mold assessment soon after the flooding to help you decide what items must be discarded and what can be saved. Time is of the essence because mold can develop within 24 hours.\n\nWhat can I keep? Family heirlooms, jewelry, photographs and other valuables can be air-dried and saved. Clean and disinfect them if they came in contact with floodwater.\n\nWhat should I avoid? Most of all, standing water, which is likely to be contaminated. But also look out for wildlife like snakes, raccoons or any critters trapped in your home brought in by the floodwaters.\n\nWhat happens if I wait? \"If your home is just left to sit, it will continue to deteriorate, and it becomes even more of a health threat,\" Schlegelmilch said.\n\nIn other words, act now.\n\nTAKING CARE OF YOUR WALLET\n\nThe sooner homeowners file claims with an insurance agency or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the faster a resolution can be reached. However, traditional homeowner policies don't cover flooding. Only flood insurance policies reimburse families for water damage caused by flooding.\n\n\"After Hurricane Matthew hit the southeastern United States, I worked on a project where we spoke to households and businesses about receiving assistance from their insurance or FEMA,\" Sutley said. \"Most people who had insurance and filed a claim received help within 30 days. Most people who applied for FEMA had received it within a month.\n\nWhat do I need? Insurance documents, home deeds and your Social Security card can get you started on making an insurance claim.\n\nPhotos and videos of the property both before and after the flood are also essential, since recovery agencies will likely request proof of the damage.\n\nWhere do I start? It's important to contact your insurance agency before you remove anything from your home. \"Insurance companies sometimes want to send someone down to investigate before anything is taken out,\" Schlegelmilch said.\n\nAfter contacting your insurance company, work can begin. Homeowners are encouraged to remove any carpet or drywall that has come in contact with water before mold starts to form.\n\n\"You don't want just to get surfaces to look clean; you want to make sure that there aren't any living mold spores,\" said Schlegelmilch, who recommended seeking guidance on which bleach to use from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhat if I don't have insurance? It's pretty common for people not to have flood insurance, no matter their income level. In coastal regions, it may be mandatory. But for those who live further inland, there are often local aid options.\n\n\"Find out what types of public assistance is available in your area,\" Schlegelmilch said. \"There are a lot of charities that pop up to help people get back in their homes. Some move people to the top of the list who are low-income or have disabilities.\"\n\nTo find out if you qualify for assistance or for more information, check FEMA's website disasterassistance.gov.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/11/hurricane-michael-what-do-when-storm-floods-house/1590785002/",

(Photo: YURI KOCHETKOV, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAn American and a Russian astronaut made an emergency landing Thursday after their rocket malfunctioned en route to the International Space Station.\n\nNASA said its astronaut Nick Hague and Alexei Ovchinin, of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, were in good condition and out of the capsule that carried them back to Earth.\n\n\"I\u2019m grateful that everyone is safe. A thorough investigation into the cause of the incident will be conducted,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.\n\nRussian presidential spokesman Dmitry Pescov told reporters: \"Thank God, the crew is alive.\" He said President Vladimir Putin was receiving regular updates about the situation.\n\nIt was to be the first space mission for Hague, who joined NASA\u2019s astronaut corps in 2013. Ovchinin spent six months on the orbiting outpost in 2016.\n\nThe two landed about 12 miles east of the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan. Spacecraft returning from the International Space Station (ISS) normally land in that region. The men were flown by helicopter to Dzhezkazgan and will be taken to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, outside of Moscow in Russia.\n\nThe astronauts lifted off as scheduled at 4:40 a.m. ET from the Russia-leased Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan atop a Soyuz booster rocket. They were to dock at the ISS six hours later, but the booster suffered engine failure minutes after the launch.\n\n\"There was an issue with the booster from today\u2019s launch. The Soyuz capsule returned to Earth via a ballistic descent, which is a sharper angle of landing compared to normal,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nRoscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin tweeted: \"The crew has landed. Everybody is alive,\" Russian news agency Tass reported.\n\nNASA posted pictures of Hague and Ovchinin undergoing a medical check-up at Dzhezkazgan\u2019s airport. One of the pictures showed Hague smiling and another showed him sitting next to Russia\u2019s space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin.\n\nWhile the Russian space program has been dogged by a string of launch failures and other incidents in recent years, Thursday\u2019s mishap marked the program\u2019s first manned launch failure since September 1983, when a Soyuz exploded on the launch pad.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said that all manned launches will be suspended pending an investigation into the cause of the failure. He said Russia will share all the relevant information with the U.S.\n\n\"I think the Americans will show understanding regarding this situation. Naturally, we will not conceal the causes,\" he said, according to Tass.\n\nWhen asked whether the launch failure will affect space cooperation between Russia and the U.S., he said: \"Of course, they should know. We will convey all the necessary information on this incident to them.\"\n\nHe added that \"today only Russia ensures the transportation of space crews to the International Space Station,\" Tass reported.\n\n\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\n.@AstroHague and Alexey Ovchinin are seen in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.

NFL players were arrested or cited at least 71 times for various alleged crimes, including 10 incidents for the Cincinnati Bengals alone and 20 arrests for players suspected of driving drunk.\n\nThe problem got so bad that the league was forced to crack down on it after hiring Roger Goodell as the NFL\u2019s new sheriff that August.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t quite work. Another surge of criminal cases disrupted the league in 2013 and 2014, prompting it to revamp its strategy.\n\nAnd now the NFL is learning just how well it\u2019s holding up this time, based on nearly four years of data since its new policies took hold in 2015. Some of the results are striking:\n\n\u25ba NFL player arrests and criminal citations have dropped to about 38 per year since then, compared to about 57 per year in the 10 years prior, according to an analysis of the USA TODAY Sports database of more than 900 such incidents involving players since 2000.\n\n\u25ba Arrest rates for drunken driving and domestic violence both have fallen in step. DUI arrests are down to about nine per year since January 2015, compared to 15 per year from 2005-2014. Domestic abuse arrests dipped from about seven per year from 2005-2014 to about five per year since 2015.\n\n\u25ba And the Bengals have had only four known incidents since then, cooling their bad boy image after a rash of incidents in the previous decade.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re a much more enlightened population, and that makes us stronger and better and I think also has an impact on actions,\u201d said Anna Isaacson, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president for social responsibility. \u201cI think you see the results in actions by incidents going down.\u201d\n\nNobody\u2019s celebrating, however. The league still considers one arrest to be too many, even if that might not realistic. At the same time, the data shows that the league experienced a watershed year in 2014, leading to changes that seem to be lasting.\n\nThat September was when a video went viral of running back Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee in a casino elevator. The outrage that erupted over his lenient two-game suspension soon hurled the league into a public relations crisis, compelling it to crack down on player conduct again and toughen its approach to domestic abuse.\n\nThe past four years also marked a transformation in punishment and prevention for driving drunk. That same September, the league and players union agreed to two-game suspensions for first-time DUI offenses instead of fines. Meanwhile, ride-share services such as Uber and Lyft have exploded in popularity, making it easier to get home safely after partying.\n\nLast year, the players union announced a partnership with Lyft in which active players would be eligible to receive $250 in ride credits.\n\nMore: What if Patrick Mahomes landed with Bills or another team? QB dominoes have come to define NFL\n\nMore: Six NFL stars who deserve more help from their teams\n\n\u201cPeople want to go out; people want to have a good time,\u201d Philadelphia Eagles receiver Jordan Matthews said. \u201cBut I think Uber and Lyft and things like that have done a great job giving people that opportunity to not putting other people in danger.\u201d\n\nThat and other changes by the league have led to a significant reduction in such incidents, though some issues persist and some teams do better than others. While the Bengals appear better behaved, the Green Bay Packers and New York Jets lead the league with 11 arrests or citations since 2015. The Minnesota Vikings and Denver Broncos have the most incidents since 2000 with 51 and 50, including three and five since 2015, according to the database.\n\nDrinking and not driving\n\nTo provide context on player conduct issues that have challenged the league, USA TODAY Sports has tracked NFL arrests and criminal citations of active NFL players since 2000. Some incidents come to light later or avoid detection. The list of 900-plus incidents are overwhelmingly misdemeanor cases, often resulting from traffic stops, with drunk driving remaining the league\u2019s biggest criminal problem \u2013 about 25% of all NFL arrests.\n\nThe problem turned especially tragic in December 2012, when Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Josh Brent drove drunk and crashed in an accident that killed his teammate and passenger, Jerry Brown. Brent was convicted of intoxication manslaughter in 2014. The NFL toughened its DUI punishment later that year.\n\n\u201cYou don't want to be the guy that's putting a black eye on your team,\u201d Jets offensive tackle Kelvin Beachum said. \u201cAnd I think organizations as a whole have made a point that if you do this, you may not be the guy for us. And the leash for some people is not as long as it is for others. So it's a give-and-take for both ends, the organization and the players understanding the ramifications and consequences for some of the things that go along with DUI arrests and things of that nature.\"\n\nThe league had at least 35 combined DUI arrests in 2012 and 2013, compared to about 20 over the last two years, part of a culture change that emphasizes both prevention and increased accountability.\n\nTake the case of Jameis Winston. Early one morning in 2016, the Tampa Bay quarterback got into the front seat of a ride with Uber. Though he may have prevented a DUI arrest by not getting behind the wheel, the female driver accused him of grabbing her crotch in the car while waiting in line at a drive-thru restaurant in Arizona.\n\nWinston wasn\u2019t arrested or charged with a crime. But the NFL investigated and concluded Winston had touched the driver in an inappropriate and sexual manner without her consent, a form of sexual assault, which is another big emphasis now in the league\u2019s annual social responsibility education program for players and staff.\n\nThe NFL then punished Winston with a three-game suspension that ended last month. He apologized to the driver and said, \u201cI have eliminated alcohol from my life.\u201d\n\nIsaacson said the league\u2019s beefed-up educational programs are designed to help players and staff gain broader understanding of sexual assault and domestic violence beyond just \u201chow to stay out of trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose is (players and staff) need to understand these issues and know how they can affect your community, when you need to speak up if you see something, how you can help people who may be effected, and what actions you can take as an everyday citizen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very different mindset than we were in, in 2014.\u201d\n\nThis has helped the league also make progress with domestic abuse, part of which might be measured by the dip in arrests for such cases since 2015. Tougher punishment plays a role, too. Before the Rice video aired, the NFL had been historically lenient on domestic violence cases, usually never punishing a player with more than a one- or two-game suspension.\n\nThe NFL since increased the discipline for first-time offenses to six-game suspensions, even if the player hadn\u2019t been arrested, subject to various circumstances. Last year, the league handed down a six-game ban for Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, who hadn\u2019t been arrested but still was punished by the league based on domestic abuse evidence it found to be credible.\n\nIt was another example of the NFL holding players to an elevated standard that goes well beyond the requirements of the criminal justice system, often with pushback from players and their union.\n\nProtecting the shield\n\nThe league often has pointed out that its player arrest rate historically has been lower than that of the general population, even during its worst years for arrests, a claim that is supported by a 2015 study conducted by the University of Texas Dallas involving males ages 20-39.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports also found that roughly one-third of NFL arrest cases lead to acquittal or charges being dropped without punishment. The remaining two-thirds end up with some type of legal punishment after plea deals, convictions or diversion programs. Beyond that, thousands of players participate in the league each year without incident.\n\nBut the crises of four to five years ago still demanded more from the league. Big criminal cases especially can dominate the public conversation about the league, as they did with the Rice video or when tight end Aaron Hernandez was charged with murder in 2013, less than a year after he signed a five-year contract worth up to $40 million.\n\n\u201cIt was critical that the NFL responded to the high-profile, high-visibility cases in the manner they did,\u201d said Alex Piquero, a criminologist at UT Dallas who has conducted research on NFL player arrests, including this year on how crime in college predicts violent crime in the NFL.\n\nProtecting the NFL shield \u2013 its image and brand -- is why it matters to Goodell and team owners. Their players are highly paid public figures who attract media attention with any incident involving police. Sponsors and consumers are paying attention, even if it always will be a work in progress with new young men coming into the league each year, usually around age 21.\n\n\u201cJust like any organization, the NFL would probably prefer that their players are not arrested at all,\u201d Piquero said in an e-mail. \u201cHowever \u2026 I also do not think it is very realistic. Evidence from general population studies in criminology show that roughly a third will have some type of criminal justice contact, usually arrest, by their mid-20s. Although I am not sure I would view such an arrest percentage as necessarily successful, I would argue that these estimates provide a type of baseline of what we may expect.\u201d\n\nContinued progress is a more realistic goal.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s trending in the right direction,\u201d Isaacson said.\n\nContributing: Martin Frank, Andy Vasquez\n\nContact sports reporter Brent Schrotenboer at bschrotenb@usatoday.com or follow him on Twitter @Schrotenboer",

Downtown Panama City was particularly hard hit when Hurricane Michael made landfall on Oct. 10, 2018. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\nPANAMA CITY, Fla. \u2013 Michael, the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's Panhandle, left destruction and death in its path as it crossed Georgia and eased to tropical storm status on its way through the Carolinas.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said early Thursday that the eye of Michael was about 40 miles west of Columbia, South Carolina, still rocking maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as it swept northeast at 21 mph. The core of Michael was moving across central South Carolina, headed for central and eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia this afternoon and this evening on its way into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMichael brought widespread power outages across five states, washed-out roads, downed trees, and drove a life-threatening storm surge that has drowned houses in some areas along the Florida coastline.\n\nMichael arrived Wednesday in Florida\u2019s Panhandle with historical force, one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever come ashore in the United States with 155 mph sustained winds, violent waves and sideways rain.\n\nMore: Hurricane Michael: What you need to know in graphics\n\nMore: In a harrowing two hours, Hurricane Michael devastates Panama City\n\nA child in Seminole County, Georgia, was reported dead early Thursday morning after a tree fell on a home during the storm. A man was killed Wednesday in Greensboro, Florida, also by a falling tree that struck his home.\n\nThere are up to 500,000 homes and businesses without power in Florida, Alabama and Georgia, according to estimates, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is already warning that some could be without power for weeks.\n\nThe Thursday morning sun revealed the true extent of damage to this picturesque seaside town clobbered by Hurricane Michael, its sugar-sand beaches now littered with debris and the turquoise Gulf of Mexico waters receding following the storm's rage.\n\nAuthorities say it will likely be weeks before roads are cleared and electricity is fully restored. Panama City was ground zero for the storm's devastation.\n\n\"It got tore up. It looks like a bomb went off,\" said Chris Allen, 48, as he surveyed the damage to the historic downtown.\n\nA curfew was in effect Wednesday night and Thursday morning to prevent looting, although Jane Lindsey, 72, was taking no chances. Lindsey and her husband spent the night in lawn chairs guarding their store, the Elegant Endeavors Antique Emporium on Harrison Avenue. The wind tore off the roof, poured water into all three floors, and blew out their front windows.\n\n\"We've never seen this kind of devastation,\" Lindsey said, her feet crunching the broken glass that once was her plate-glass windows. \"It's such a loss for all these families, for all these small businesses.\"\n\nLindsay was so worried about her store that she and her husband abandoned their nearby home to the storm: \"We don't even know if we have a house left. We can't leave here.\"\n\nThe storm walloped Panama City and nearby Panama City Beach, the winds so strong they toppled railroad cars, snapped utility poles and flipped RVs and SUVs like toys. The streets and parking lots glisten with broken glass. Police officers spent the night patrolling the area and responding to calls for assistance, making do with damaged patrol cars. The air itself smells like a sawmill, a legacy of the thousands of shredded trees.\n\nFederal officials are prepared with tarps for thousands of roof-damaged homes across the region, and government survey ships are checking coastlines for additional damage. Thousands of contractors are set to replace utility poles and string new electric lines, but the damage to businesses will take far longer to fix. Panama City and Panama City Beach are heavily dependent on tourism, and officials are optimistic they can be up and running again soon. The beaches were largely unaffected by the storm, which hit the east side of Panama City hardest. Panama City Beach, a separate town, is west of there.\n\nTourism is the region's biggest economic driver, with about 17 million visitors annually sunning themselves on the 27 miles of soft sand beaches. Panama City Beach is particularly popular with residents of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Texas, Florida, Missouri and Illinois because it's a relatively easy drive for most southerners and has the closest beaches to the Midwest. The city has already had a record-breaking tourism year, with visits up 10.2 percent before the storm hit. Officials promise they'll be back open for business as fast as possible, so tourists can enjoy Thanksgiving's \"Beach Home for the Holidays\" and a 10,000-ball beachball drop for New Year's Eve.\n\n\"Panama City Beach is so resilient, and the whole community will be working together to get things back up and running,\" said Jayna Leach, a spokeswoman for Visit Panama City Beach. \"With all of us working tougher, we'll be back up and running and be back to the world-class destination that we always have been.\"\n\nLindsey isn't so sure. After years of struggling to keep the store afloat, she doesn't know whether it can survive the flooding, wind damage and potential loss of precious antiques inside.\n\n\"Will it ever recover? Who knows. We'd like to think it would come back. We've had other setbacks, normal things that small towns go through. But how long will this take? Two years, three years, to get back on our feet?\" Lindsey said. \"We're thinking, is this the time to give it up, to retire?\"\n\nDuring a late-night interview on FOX News Channel\u2019s FOX News @ Night with Shannon Bream, President Donald Trump called Michael \u201ca tough wind storm\u201d that has undoubtedly resulted in \u201ctremendous\u201d damage.\n\n\u201cSo, to a certain extent, we don\u2019t know (the full scope) because it\u2019s so dark and all the electric is out.

Hopefully not houses with people in them.\u201d\n\nHours earlier, during a campaign-style rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump offered thoughts and prayers for those affected by Michael\u2019s rampage and told the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019ll be traveling to Florida very, very shortly.\u201d\n\nMichael made landfall on Wednesday afternoon near Mexico Beach as the strongest recorded hurricane to ever hit the Florida Panhandle and the mightiest October hurricane in U.S. history.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump kicked off his rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, by telling everyone in the path of Hurricane Michael that the nation's thoughts and prayers are with them.

USA TODAY\n\nDamage from Hurricane Michael seen in Panama City, Florida.

And those are just the visible dangers: The water itself can carry bacteria and viruses that pose a major health hazard.\n\nAuthorities are pleading with residents to shelter in place, keeping the roads clear for emergency vehicles and reducing the risk of additional casualties. At least one man has died in the storm, after a falling tree crashed into his house in Greensboro, Florida.\n\nLeaving home now raises the risks of injury, experts said. Many roads remain closed and impassible, most stores are closed and power is out for an estimated 500,000 people across three states, authorities said.\n\nAmong the medical dangers are cholera, Hepatitis A and vibriosis, said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency room physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Glatter said storm victims need to stay focused on staying healthy while they await recovery efforts. That may mean not rushing outside as soon as the skies clear.\n\n\u201cDon't panic\u2014 try to take things one step at a time when you feel overwhelmed,\u201d he said.\n\nFlooding from hurricanes often brings increased risk of gastrointestinal disease as people accidentally ingest contaminated water, a potentially disgusting mix of saltwater, rain, runoff and anything those waters have touched as they rushed through homes, sewer lines and buildings.\n\n'Beyond words': Social media tales bear witness to Hurricane Michael's astonishing force\n\n'No problem at all': Meet the Dog Island holdout and his 'Cat-5' house that stood strong in the face of Hurricane Michael\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re concerned about is standing water because we have no idea what\u2019s in the water,\" said Holly Kirsch, program administrator for the Department of Health-Leon County. \"There could be power lines, there could be debris, there could be glass, there could be animals such as snakes.\"\n\nAn army of contractors and government workers will swing into action Thursday morning to begin clearing roads and downed power lines, clearing any clogged drains and trying to restore power to as many people as possible.

Adam Shell explains.\n\nepa07084369 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, New York, USA, on 10 October 2018. The Dow Jones industrial average lost over 800 points today. EPA-EFE/JUSTIN LANE ORG XMIT: JLX08 (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE)\n\nIt sure felt like a sell-everything day on Wall Street Wednesday: Stock prices plunged, and talk of a panic and comeuppance for the nearly 10-year old bull market took hold.\n\nSo why did stock prices fall so far, so fast, seemingly out of nowhere? And what explains the 832-point drop for the Dow Jones industrial average just a week after the blue-chip stock gauge notched a record high?\n\nWhile there's never a perfect answer to explain how market psychology can turn on a dime, here's how financial pros are making sense of the worst day for the Dow since February, and a big decline in popular technology stocks.\n\nWhat sparked the fall?\n\nNervousness had been building for days on Wall Street. The catalyst was the recent spike in the yield on a closely watched government bond to a seven-year high.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note -- whose key rate impacts the pricing on things ranging from fixed-rate mortgages to stocks to virtually every financial asset on the planet -- recently climbed above 3.25 percent for the first time since May 2011. And when you add the threat of higher borrowing costs on things like houses and cars and corporate debt to the economic obstacles caused by the U.S. trade war with China, all it takes is a whiff of weakness to set a major sell-off in motion.\n\n\"We don't know who is to blame here; it's a little like trying to find what or who is responsible for the dangerous hurricane in Florida today,\" says Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, a Tokyo-based global bank with offices in New York. \"But make no mistake about it, the stock market decline, triggered perhaps by rising bond yields, is just as dangerous.\"\n\nMore Money: Dow drops 800 points, led by tech shares, as stock market investors fear higher rates\n\nMore Money: Mortgage rates on 30-year home loan hit 5 percent, a nearly 8-year high\n\nMore Money: Sears may file for bankruptcy as debt payment looms, reports say\n\nWhy are interest rates rising?\n\nRates are heading higher because things are good in the U.S.\n\n\"Interest rates are rising because economic data has been positive,\" explains Paul Hickey, co-founder at Bespoke Investment Group in New York.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of historically low interest rates and slow economic growth, the U.S. economy is picking up speed, bolstered by President Trump's policies such as tax cuts and less regulation of businesses. The economy grew 4.2 percent in the second quarter, its fastest pace in four years. And the job market is robust, with the September unemployment rate of 3.7 percent the lowest in nearly fifty years.\n\nIn short, there's no longer a need for borrowing costs to stay at depressed, emergency levels. The fear now is the economy will get too hot and cause both price and wage inflation to spike, which hurts the buying power of consumers and crimps the earnings of employers.\n\nWhy are higher interest rates a problem?\n\nFor one, higher interest rates means bonds pay out bigger streams of interest to investors, which makes fixed-income investments a legitimate alternative to stocks. In short, \"there's more competition for stocks,\" says Hickey.\n\nSecondly, he says, higher interest rates raise borrowing costs for consumers and companies, so auto loans and mortgages become more expensive and companies have a harder time tapping the debt market. \"Clearly, higher rates are not good for housing or auto sales,\" says Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. And if sales of these big-ticket items slow, so does the broader economy.\n\nFinally, higher rates are especially problematic for so-called growth stocks, which includes tech stocks. \"The lure for these stocks is growth in earnings down the road, but when interest rates are higher, the future value of those earnings streams declines,\" Hickey says. On Wednesday, video streamer Netflix fell 8.4 percent, Facebook tumbled 4.1 percent and Apple fell 4.6 percent.\n\nWhy are tech stocks, in particular, dropping?\n\nShares of tech companies, including the so-called FAANG stocks -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet -- have been market darlings for years. So when a sell-off gains steam, the stocks with the biggest gains are among the ones that investors sell first to lock in profits. Tech stocks have also been caught in the trade fight with China, as the Trump's tough stance on Beijing is causing disruptions in their supply chain. Technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet are also facing intense regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. government.\n\n\"Tech companies are in harm's way because of the trade war with China, in addition to concerns about rising interest rates,\" says Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\nCould this be the beginning of a correction?\n\nThere's always a chance that the sell-off can morph into a decline of 10 percent or more from the market's September peak, which could thrust the market into its second so-called price correction of the year, says Zaccarelli. Still, he predicts that any downturn won't become a bear market, or 20-percent drop, and will instead turn out to be a good buying opportunity for investors with time to ride out any storm.\n\nWhy? \"The economic fundamentals are strong and rates are going up for a good reason,\" Zaccarelli says.\n\nIs there reason to panic?\n\n\"Sure, investors feel nervous, but this is not the time to panic and sell,\" advises Thorne Perkin, president of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management in New York. \"We don't view this as a psychological shift, but an overdue sell-off.\"\n\nThe current market decline \"won't be fun,\" Perkin adds, \"but this sell-off will end and a strong economy will carry us through the end of the year.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/10/why-stock-market-went-down-so-much/1593803002/",

(Photo: Steve Karnowski/AP)\n\nIn less than four weeks, Americans will go to the polls and choose who will lead us. This time, it\u2019s not hyperbole to say that this is the most important election of our lifetimes.\n\nFor the past two years, Republicans have had total control over the House, the Senate and the White House. What do they have to show for their leadership?\n\nA tax scam that pads the pockets of millionaires and billionaires at the expense of the middle class.\n\nSkyrocketing health care costs and prescription drug prices that are forcing millions of Americans deep into debt.\n\nA culture of corruption in Washington that\u2019s so far-reaching it\u2019s putting our entire democracy at risk.\n\nA nation that is growing more divided and more cynical \u2013 and a politics more chaotic and exhausting \u2013 with each passing day.\n\nDemocrats will cut health costs and corruption\n\nHouse Democrats have a different plan: We will fight for the people. We will build a safer, stronger and forward-looking America. In our efforts to right our nation's course, we will work with the administration when possible and hold the president accountable when necessary. If we have the opportunity to lead the House of Representatives next year, we will lower your health care costs, increase your pay and clean up corruption so Washington works for you.\n\nDemocrats believe America is strongest with a health care system that prioritizes people \u2014 not one that taxes and takes advantage of patients. We will fight to protect your right to quality and affordable health care by reining in the costs of prescription drugs, building on the current system to make it work better for everyone, and protecting those with pre-existing conditions from Republican attempts to strip them of care.\n\nMore: How to prevent corruption, protect the rule of law and repair democracy\n\nRepublicans hand Democrats an election-year gift on health care and it's a winner\n\nRepublicans hoped voters would forget they tried to kill health law. They bet wrong.\n\nDemocrats believe America is most prosperous when every American has a shot at success and plays by the same fair rules. We know that our economy is stronger when everybody\u2019s hard work is respected and pays off with higher wages, higher incomes and decent retirement benefits. We will invest in our crumbling infrastructure to create 16 million well paid jobs rebuilding roads, bridges and ports all around this country.\n\nAnd Democrats believe that government exists to serve the American people, not just those with the biggest checkbooks. On day one, we will take steps to end the culture of corruption in Washington. We will strengthen ethics laws to remove the corrosive influence of lobbyists and special interests from Congress, stop foreign money from influencing our elections and create more transparency and accountability for our leaders.\n\nDesperate Republicans resort to scare tactics\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, won\u2019t be offering a better vision or new ideas. They will continue to distract, deflect and divide us. With their grip on power at risk, they\u2019re growing increasingly desperate and resorting to scare tactics because they can\u2019t run on their own record. They are pitting Americans against each other instead of working to bring the country together.\n\nThey will continue to turn a blind eye to the real challenges we face. They will continue to revert back to their same tired playbook. When special interests and lobbyists write your tax bill in a smoke-filled room, you end up with a law that hands over trillions of your tax dollars to the top 1 percent of Americans. Reelecting the GOP will mean more of the same.\n\nThe choice is clear. Democrats are fighting for the people \u2014 and Republicans are fighting for the powerful. It\u2019s time to get America back on track. It's time to come together to lower your health care costs, increase your pay and make Washington work for you.\n\nDemocratic Reps.

  "text": "Sears hasn't been able to get its cash burn under control. (Photo: Sears Holdings)\n\nFor years, there have been reports of Sears death spiraling toward the corporate graveyard alongside other popular brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nThe company, once one of the great brands of America, has managed to stay afloat in recent years by borrowing cash from its CEO and selling off desirable assets such as real-estate and brands.\n\nNow, reports say Sears is working with advisers to prepare to possibly file for bankruptcy, as soon as this week. But just because Sears Holdings Corp. might be in trouble doesn't mean consumers have to be.\n\nIn the wake of all that's happening, here's what Sears shoppers should know:\n\nMore: Sears may file for bankruptcy as debt payment looms, reports say\n\nQuestion: Will my local store close?\n\nAnswer: Possibly.\n\nSo far, Sears has announced that 46 of its underperforming stores are closing in November. The plan involves shutting down 13 Kmart locations and 33 Sears stores in several states.\n\nQ: Can I still use my gift card?\n\nA: Yes \u2013 at least for now. But experts suggest that you put them to use ASAP.\n\n\"In general, people shouldn\u2019t hold on to gift cards,\" said Katherine Hutt, director of communications for the Council of Better Business Bureaus. \"They should go and spend them as soon as they can, regardless of the status of the company.\"\n\nQ: What's the best time to shop for deep discounts?\n\nA: Now \u2013 maybe.\n\n\"When retailers close stores, they are likely to have some sales. You have to be careful though. Yes, some items are going to be deeply discounted, but it is also likely they will be marked 'no return,' \" Hutt said.\n\nThere may not be a store to return to.\n\nQ: I purchased an extended warranty. Will Sears still honor it?\n\nA: Until the point at which a company files for bankruptcy, warranties and return policies will likely be \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d Hutt said.\n\nHowever, when Sears closed down its Canada stores last year, the retailer stopped honoring extended warranties. \"After October 18, Sears will no longer be in a position to honour Sears Protection Agreements to customers,\" the chain said in a 2017 release.\n\nRefunds on protection agreements were only allowed if purchased within 30 days of the company's liquidation announcement.\n\nThe good news is that some other companies stepped in to honor the agreements and perform repairs at no cost to customers. But that's no guarantee.\n\nQ: Will the return policy change?\n\nA: It shouldn't change immediately, according to the BBB.\n\nQ: What about layaway?\n\nA: \u201cIf you have anything on layaway, you should go get it and pay it off. If you were planning to buy anything to match something you already have, you should get that as quickly as possible,\" Hutt said.\n\nQ: How do I leave a complaint?\n\nA: Sears has been a BBB-accredited business since 1966, so the company is required to handle complaints up until it files for bankruptcy. \"Closing a business doesn't relieve the owner of that responsibility,\" according to the BBB website.\n\nIf you would like more information, contact your local Better Business Bureau.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @dalvin_brown\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/11/sears-trouble-what-customers-should-do-if-company-files-bankruptcy/1589306002/",

  "text": "CLOSE Jamie Lee Curtis responds to Fox News' attempt to shame her for Laurie Strode's gun use in the latest \"Halloween\" film. USA TODAY\n\nJamie Lee Curtis stars in the new \"Halloween\" film. (Photo: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nHOLLYWOOD \u2013 Jamie Lee Curtis would like a word about her views on guns.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the actress found herself in Fox News' crosshairs when an article suggested her advocacy for gun reform is hypocritical, given the firearms she wields in the upcoming \"Halloween\" film.\n\nPointing to several of the actress' tweets calling for action after mass shootings in Orlando and Texas, the report called Curtis \"one of several Hollywood actors who use firearms in their films while preaching against them away from the set.\"\n\nThat's a bunch of nonsense, says Curtis. \"It was just silly, because they were trying to make a point without ever asking me what I really think,\" the 59-year-old actress told USA TODAY during an interview Wednesday afternoon. \"And what I think might surprise them.\"\n\nReview: Jamie Lee Curtis' rage fuels a worthy new 'Halloween' revamp with depth\n\nMore: Nick Castle, the original Michael Myers, puts on his 'Halloween' mask once more\n\nCurtis, who returns to the screen in \"Halloween\" on Oct. 19, says her views on gun reform have been clear. \u201cI am vocal about common-sense gun safety and gun laws,\" she says. \"For instance, I fully support an assault weapon ban, I fully support a bump stock ban.\"\n\nThat doesn't make her anti-gun, she clarifies. \"I fully support the Bill of Rights. And fully support the Second Amendment. And have absolutely no problem with people owning firearms if they have been trained, licensed, a background check has been conducted, a pause button has been pushed to give time for that process to take place. And they have to renew their license just like we do with automobiles \u2013 which are weapons also.\"\n\nCLOSE Classic horror villain Michael Myers returns to stalk small town Haddonfield, Ill. \u2014 and old foil Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) \u2014 in \"Halloween.\" USA TODAY\n\nIn the upcoming \"Halloween,\" Curtis returns as Laurie Strode, now a grandmother whose entire life has been plagued by the trauma she experienced at the hands of the masked, murderous Michael Myers at age 17. Before shooting the latest installment, it was Curtis who steered production away from Strode stockpiling automated weapons, like machine guns.\n\n\"They knew that Laurie was going to be someone who used firearms,\" says Curtis. \"And I think there were myriad types of firearms that could have been used in the movie. I was very clear with the filmmakers that she used the weapons (that) were intended for self-defense for her and her family.\"\n\nLaurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) gets all her weaponry in order as she waits for the return of masked psycho Michael Myers in \"Halloween.\" (Photo: RYAN GREEN)\n\nCurtis adds that when Strode arms her daughter and granddaughter as Myers closes in, she removes the guns from behind a padlocked cabinet, \"and then very specifically says what each weapon does and why you would choose that weapon in self-defense.\"\n\nAs for those who call actors hypocritical for wielding guns on screen while advocating for gun safety?\n\n\"I\u2019m an actress who\u2019s in slasher movies,\" Curtis says. \"I have to be responsible for my own personal choices in my own personal life. But I am an actor for hire. And honestly, if I had made my career as a pacifist actor, I would never have worked, ever.\"\n\nCurtis adds, \"But I have always been proud to represent women who fight back and fight back with intelligence, cunning and creativity, and who fight for their lives and their families\u2019 lives.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/10/10/jamie-lee-curtis-claps-back-fox-news-halloween-gun-controversy/1597170002/",

  "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2018/10/11/ios-12-tips-security-settings-change/1590461002/",
  "text": "When Apple released its latest iPhone operating system, iOS 12, the company added a Shortcuts app. Loup Ventures analyst Andrew Murphy says it's a must-have. (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)\n\nApple\u2019s latest mobile software, iOS 12, tightens up security and privacy issues on iPhones.\n\nTo get the most out of the updates though, you might have to tweak a setting or two.\n\nHere\u2019s how to take full advantage of the latest bug fixes and make sure you\u2019re keeping your device as safe as you can from hackers and prying eyes.\n\nTake advantage of stronger passcodes\n\nApple didn\u2019t change the default lock screen from a four-digit code to six-digit one just to mess with you. The longer your device passcode is, the harder it is to hack. Hackers often use software to cycle through every possible passcode combination \u2014 known as a brute-force attack \u2014 and since a four-digit passcode has just 10,000 possible combinations, it doesn\u2019t take long for a computer to break right in!\n\nMore: Thinking of a new iPhone? You may want to try iOS 12 first\n\nIf you\u2019re still using a six-digit or, heaven forbid, a four-digit passcode, it\u2019s time to upgrade to something better. You can make passcodes as long as you want, and you can set it to use numbers and letters or numbers only. I prefer numerical only because then I don\u2019t have to mess with the keyboard, but go with whatever works for you. Just know that if you\u2019re still using 111111 or 123456 \u2014 you\u2019re begging to get hacked.\n\nGo to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and enter your current passcode. Then, go to Change Passcode and, from the Passcode Options and set a Custom Numeric Code.\n\nUse automated two-factor authentication\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to all your logins by asking new devices to confirm that they\u2019re legit. After you log in to an app or site with two-factor enabled you\u2019ll get a text message to your phone number with a verification code, ensuring you\u2019re the only one who can access the account.\n\nApple has two-factor support baked right into iOS 12, and it\u2019s so incredibly easy to use that it auto-fills the codes for you \u2014 so you don\u2019t even have to type them in.\n\nGo to Settings > Password & Security and then tap Turn on Two-Factor Authentication. Once you do this, your phone guides you through the rest of the setup process.\n\nTurn on USB-restricted mode to make your phone even harder to hack\n\nOne of the most significant security changes in iOS 12 is that Apple made it much harder for iPhone thieves or privacy-snooping meddlers to sniff your phone for information about you.\n\nWhen you plug your phone into a USB device it can do two things: get charged and transfer data. In the past, when you connected your phone into a computer, it asked for verification to keep you safe, but there were still tools that hackers could use to get around that.\n\nMore: Apple's adding 70 new icons in iOS 12.1 update\n\nAfter seven days without being unlocked, iOS 11 would finally lock down the charging port to prevent any attempts at breaching its security. iOS 12 shortens that time window in a big way. Now, it locks down iPhone\u2019s charging port into power-only mode after just one hour after you last unlocked it.\n\nTo set this correctly, head into Settings > Face ID (or Touch ID) & Passcode and then go all the way to the bottom of the list. There you\u2019ll see a toggle for USB Accessories. Make sure this button is OFF (gray, not green). This simple step should prevent any USB devices from trying to break into your phone after just one hour of being locked.\n\nSignificant locations: On/off?\n\nYour iPhone tracks everywhere you go so it can make location-based features in apps like Maps, Photos and Siri work smoothly. Your phone encrypts the information so nobody should be able to see it but you, but it's pretty creepy the first time you see it, especially if you don't realize that it's tracking you in such a way. It's entirely up to you whether you want to turn it off, or you can clear your saved locations any time.\n\nHead into Settings > Privacy > Location > System Services and then tap Significant Locations. Here you can see the locations that your iPhone thinks are most important to keep track of and toggle the feature on or off.\n\nUse safari\n\nThere are approximately a million web browser options in the App Store, but Apple\u2019s own built-in Safari browser comes packed with new features in iOS 12 to help keep your browsing habits more private.\n\nSafari now protects against cookies that track you across the internet, following you from site to site and potentially revealing your browsing habits to companies trying to learn more about you.\n\nMore: An underrated perk of iOS 12: Google Maps and Waze will soon be able to work with CarPlay\n\nSocial widgets on websites \u2014 like Facebook logins for comment sections \u2014 can sniff out what you\u2019re doing even if you don\u2019t interact with them. Now, Apple blocks all of those by default and even masks your phone\u2019s unique identity so that advertisers don\u2019t flood you with targeted ads.\n\nChange your copycat passcodes\n\nUsing Safari in iOS 12 should put you ahead of the privacy curve already, but your iPhone\u2019s password manager has a somewhat hidden feature to keep you even safer.\n\nGo to Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Website & App Passwords and you\u2019ll see a long list of all the passwords that iOS knows you use. But it doesn\u2019t just list them for you; it also compares them against each other to see if you\u2019ve been reusing the same password for multiple apps or websites. If it notices a duplicate, you\u2019ll see a little warning icon next to the URL or app name.\n\nConfession: I pretty much use the same password for everything \u2014 so don\u2019t feel bad if before now, you have too. The main recommendation here is to use different passwords for every single site. Why? It prevents password reuse attacks \u2014 called \u201ccredential stuffing\u201d \u2014 and makes it harder for a hacker to break into multiple sites and services using the same username and password.\n\nGo to Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Website & App Passwords and enter your passcode. You\u2019ll see a small warning symbol next to each account that recognizes a reused password. Then tap Change Password on Website button and change away.\n\nRather than thinking of dozens of different passwords, this is a good time to enable a password manager like 1Password or Dashlane. Or, use a quick trick you can easily remember, such as using a similar password, but with a specific add-on for each unique site.\n\nEnable auto updates\n\nKeep your phone in auto-update mode. Apple isn\u2019t perfect and every now and again, a privacy or security bug slips through the cracks. Apple is among the best at patching these holes quickly, and if your phone is in auto-update mode, you\u2019ll get those patches as soon as they\u2019re released.\n\nTo enable automatic updates, head to Settings > General > Software Update and make sure it\u2019s set to ON.\n\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech contributor and host of USA TODAY's digital video show TECH NOW.

(Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer, Getty Images for dcp)\n\nSEOUL \u2013 They have an army of fans around the world, but fame and fortune are not enough to keep K-pop superstars BTS from fulfilling a rite of passage nearly every South Korean man must undergo: compulsory military service.\n\nDespite some calls for exemptions for South Korea\u2019s biggest pop-culture export, the country\u2019s Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism told lawmakers this week that the boy band would fulfill their military duties.\n\n\u201cAll of the BTS members say they will definitely enlist for military service,\u201d said Minister Do Jong-hwan, in remarks reported by The Korea Herald.\n\nAt least 21 months of military service is mandatory for all able-bodied males aged 18-35 in what is seen as a necessary response to the constant threat posed by neighboring North Korea. While 2018 has seen a thawing of relations, the two countries are still technically at war, as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice but not a peace treaty.\n\nThe topic of conscription has become a hot-button issue in South Korea in recent years, with debates raging across society about whether it is still necessary, as well as who should be allowed exemptions.\n\nThe issue sparked up in September when the South Korean men\u2019s soccer team won a gold medal at the Asian Games tournament, allowing all the members of the squad \u2013 including star Son Heung-min, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur in England \u2013 to be excused from service.\n\nAthletes who bring home medals in international competitions as well as acclaimed artists, classical musicians and dancers can avoid service, but not pop stars, filmmakers or actors.\n\nHow BTS and KPop disrupted mainstream politics (Photo: Getty)\n\nBTS, the seven-member K-pop boy band that has become a global sensation, have found themselves at the center of the controversy.\n\nIn July a South Korean lawmaker, Ha Tae-kyung, suggested that the exemption system, first drafted in 1973, was outdated. \u201cYou are given an exemption if you win number one in violin, piano, and classical music competitions,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, you are not given an exemption for ranking number one on the Billboard chart.\u201d\n\nBTS has tallied two Billboard-topping albums this year and yesterday the group, which has an enormous social media presence and following, took home an American Music Award for Favorite Social Artist. In September, the band even gave an address at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Nak-yon has instructed his cabinet look at reforming the exemption system and urged the military last month \u201c to come up with a more reasonable measure by reflecting the public's growing demands.\u201d\n\nHowever, South Korea\u2019s defense ministry announced earlier this year that it was looking to scrap nearly all exemptions to military service. Despite plans to reduce troop levels from 618,000 to 500,000 and cut mandatory service to 18 months, military officials are projecting a shortfall of conscripts in coming years due to slowing population growth.\n\nAnd barring any changes to the exemption rules, it looks as if BTS \u2013 whose members range in age from 21 to 25 \u2013 will someday be trading in their flamboyant fashion and choreographed dance moves for army fatigues and military drills.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that it is being reported as if the seven members (of BTS) are excusing themselves from military enlistment,\u201d said Minister Do Jong-hwan. \u201cAs a matter of fact, they intend to do the exact opposite.\u201d\n\nBTS (Photo: STEVE GRANITZ/WIREIMAGE)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/10/11/members-bts-south-korea-boy-band-enlist-military/1598587002/",

  "text": "Holland America's Koningsdam. (Photo: Holland America Line)\n\nPlanning a Holland America cruise for the coming year? Brace yourself for higher daily fees.\n\nEffective December 1, the Seattle-based line is hiking the hotel service charge it tacks onto final bills by 7.4% to $14.50 per person, per day for passengers staying in most cabins. Passengers in suites will pay $16 per person, per day \u2014 a 6.7% rise.\n\nWith the increase, a family of four will pay at least $406 in service charges on a typical seven-night cruise.\n\nThe hike comes in the wake of recent increases in service charges (also called gratuity charges) at several other major lines including Norwegian, Royal Caribbean and Princess. It brings Holland America in line with Norwegian and Royal Caribbean, which now also add a $14.50 per person, per day charge for most cabins. Carnival and Princess levy $12.95 and $13.50 on most cabins, respectively.\n\nRELATED: Holland America promotion brings free drinks, more\n\nSuch fees have been growing in recent years at rates many times higher than inflation. As recently as November 2015, Holland America was adding just $11.50 in service charges to passenger bills. With the latest increase, service charges at the line will be up by more than 26% in just three years.\n\nSome but not all lines allow passengers to lower or remove the service charge while on board vessels if they are unhappy with service.\n\nThe practice of adding service charges to passenger bills is at a crossroads in the industry. While Holland America and other mass-market lines have been hiking such fees, a growing number of more upscale ocean lines including Azamara, Crystal, Seabourn, Regent and SeaDream have eliminated them entirely, and the practice also is disappearing at some river cruise lines. River lines Uniworld, Tauck and Scenic Cruises are among those that now include gratuities for crew members in the base fare.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/10/11/holland-america-cruise-ship-service-charge-hike-december-gratuities/1579503002/",

  "text": "'Trump and his party are on a wildly unpopular mission to gut Medicare and protections for pre-existing conditions.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP Images)\n\nUSA TODAY Opinion published a column by President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressing his opposition to \"Medicare for All\" and Democrats' plans on health care. A roundup of reaction:\n\nTrump, Republicans just hate Medicare\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s column attacking \"Medicare for All\" was filled with falsehoods to distract voters from the truth: He and his party are on a wildly unpopular mission to gut Medicare and protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\nThis year, House Republicans proposed to cut Medicare spending by $537 billion over the next 10 years. For many years, they have proposed to radically privatize Medicare into a voucher system, shifting costs to beneficiaries.\n\nImmediately after passing trillions in tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, House Speaker Paul Ryan and the White House set their sights on Medicare. Last month, Trump\u2019s National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said, \"As far as the larger entitlements, I think everybody is going to look at that probably next year.\"\n\nTrump also lied about protecting people with pre-existing conditions and lowering Obamacare premiums. The Trump administration sided with Republican state attorneys general in their lawsuit to strike down the core protections. The Republican repeal bill would have decimated these protections by causing millions to lose coverage altogether; eliminating the federal guarantee of essential benefits such as prescription drug coverage; and allowing insurance companies to charge sicker and older people much higher premiums.\n\nRelated: Cuts in Social Security and Medicare are inevitable. Delaying reform will make it worse.\n\nMore: Half of America skimps to pay for health care. The only fix is to cut waste.\n\nSenate Republicans have just voted down a Democratic bill that would have reversed the administration\u2019s rollback of consumer protections. Trump\u2019s \"junk\" plans \u2014 the Trump University of health insurance \u2014 can deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, leaving them behind in a sicker insurance pool with higher premiums. Together with repeal of the individual mandate, nonpartisan experts estimate that these policies result in premiums that are much higher than they would be otherwise.\n\nFar from harming Medicare beneficiaries, \"Medicare for All\" proposals represent the greatest advancement in financial security for seniors since Medicare was enacted in 1965. Whether everyone is enrolled in Medicare or Medicare is a guaranteed choice for all, these proposals enhance benefits for seniors, adding vision, dental and hearing benefits. They also lower drug prices and eliminate or dramatically reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs for seniors.\n\nTrump claims that Medicare for All would ration care and centralize health care decisions. This attack is absurd on its face: The current Medicare program is highly popular, and extending it to all would be no different. If Trump hates Medicare for All, the only logical conclusion is that he must hate Medicare itself.\n\nTopher Spiro is the vice president for Health Policy at the Center for American Progress. You can follow him on Twitter: @TopherSpiro.\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nComments from USA TODAY's Facebook group \"Across the Aisle, Across the Nation\":\n\nAs usual, President Donald Trump is lying in his column. He has done nothing to save our health care system and takes every opportunity to tear down Medicare. The health plan that he wanted the Republicans to pass would have us go back in time before Obamacare \u2014 including doing away with coverage of pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u2014 Diane Seligmann\n\nTrump knows nothing about the working man or senior citizens' struggles. Here in Tennessee, his followers are mostly poor, uneducated people who don't even know what the Republican Party stands for. They are on welfare, get food stamps, Medicaid, but by God they are going to follow Trump! It blows my mind.\n\n\u2014 Susan Long Kuehl\n\nFirst observation is that Trump is not intelligent enough to pen his own column. Second, nothing he spews at this point is believable. Third, he has polarized the health care debate and is out of touch with what would benefit the average American. Trump is so invested in making health care a commodity that he will never do the right thing.\n\n\u2014 Brandi Stern\n\nTotal baloney. Universal health care works in every other modern nation. Trump is in bed with Big Pharma, the medical and insurance industries.\n\n\u2014 John Steven Smith\n\nLetter to the editor\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s recent column attacking \"Medicare for All\" is laughable and riddled with \"alternative facts.\"\n\nHere are the real facts: Since taking office, Trump has done everything in his power to strip health care from millions of hardworking American families and seniors.\n\nUnlike Trump, I\u2019ve actually worked in health care. I know what happens when people go without care. Still today, I see cancer patients \u2014 including children \u2014 struggling to get the care they need. I\u2019ve watched seniors take food out of their shopping carts because they couldn\u2019t afford it and their prescriptions. And when it comes to health policy, that\u2019s the lens that my Democratic colleagues and I use.\n\nSadly, for my Republican colleagues, it\u2019s a lens of profits. They are wholly committed to making the most money possible off the sick and dying. That\u2019s just wrong.\n\nTrump\u2019s \"think piece\" is nothing more than a sad attempt to rebrand his and congressional Republicans cruel and repeated attempts to take health care away from the American people. It won\u2019t work. Seniors and American families are smart; they know who is on their side.\n\nRep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust; Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nJames Freeman, The Wall Street Journal: \"Just like the Senate plan offered by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the House measure, which is indeed co-sponsored by most House Democrats, does not allow capitalism in the health care industry. 'No institution may be a participating provider unless it is a public or not-for-profit institution,' says the plain language of H.R. 676. And how can we be sure that it replaces Medicare rather than leaving it alone? The official summary of the bill makes clear that Medicare money will be redirected to finance the new program. ... Health care is the must-win issue for Democrats. Now President Donald Trump is correctly explaining why SandersCare would be a loser for patients and taxpayers.\"\n\nPaul Waldman, The Washington Post: \"Trump and the Republicans will defend Medicare from Democrats! If you believe that, you\u2019ll hire an arsonist to protect your house from the fire department. The strangeness of this argument highlights a fundamental problem Republicans can\u2019t get away from: They hate Medicare, but the American public loves Medicare. ... Because Medicare works extremely well and provides a valued benefit to tens of millions of politically potent citizens, it is impossible for them to unwind it as they would like to do. So every election, Democrats accuse them of wanting to destroy the program, which requires them to pretend that they actually love it and want to defend it.\"\n\nEveryone needs to chill about a president getting an op-ed in USA Today. Presidents have done that before. They will do it again. This is OK.\n\nSure, it's garbage, but that's fine, too. Attack the garbage. Debate! \u2014 John Stoehr (@johnastoehr) October 10, 2018\n\nMatthew Yglesias, Vox: \"This is the core lie of Trump\u2019s op-ed. It is 100 percent true that the left wing of the Democratic Party is pushing a substantial change to the American health care system, and there are many legitimate qualms one might have with that change. But the proposal is to make Medicare more generous, not stingier, as Trump wants senior citizens to believe. Meanwhile, even though Trump himself maintains that he wants to avoid cuts to Medicare and Social Security, key members of his party \u2014 including senior figures in his own administration \u2014 keep pushing for cuts.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY, email letters@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/10/trump-knows-nothing-medicare-health-care-democrats-talker/1592789002/",

(Photo: Nick Ut, AP)\n\nELIZABETH, N.J. -- Former Major League Baseball player Lenny Dykstra has been indicted by a Union County (New Jersey) grand jury on two drug charges and allegedly threatening an Uber driver during a May incident in Linden, N.J.\n\nDykstra was indicted on possession of cocaine and possession of methamphetamine, both third-degree crimes, according to the indictment handed up Tuesday. He was also indicted on a terroristic threat charge, also a third-degree crime.\n\nDykstra, a three-time All-Star, played 12 seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets and was a member of the Mets\u2019 1986 championship team. He is slated to be arraigned on the indictment charges, but that court date has yet to be scheduled, according to the Union County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nIn August, Dykstra, through his attorney Michael Brucki, rejected a non-custodial probation plea offer on the terroristic threats charge.

The driver repeatedly honked his horn before coming to an abrupt stop.\n\nThe Uber driver ran from the vehicle and told police he had picked up Dykstra in Linden for a scheduled fare before Dykstra apparently tried to change the destination. The driver refused to make the destination change.\n\nDykstra allegedly put a weapon to the driver's head and threatened to kill him, according to police. No weapon was found in Dykstra's possession. Both Dykstra and the Uber driver, Brian Lutty, 47, allege the other made him fear for his life.\n\nIf convicted, Dykstra could face up to 10 years in prison, in part because he has two prior convictions, including a federal conviction for fraud.\n\nSuzanne Russell: srussell@mycentraljersey.com",

Rick Scott said Wednesday.\n\nThe massive storm hit the Panhandle in northwest Florida early Wednesday afternoon, leaving a trail of devastation.\n\nABC News chief meteorologist Ginger Zee said the ruins in Mexico Beach were \"eerily reminiscent to the scene I saw in Gulfport [Louisiana] in 2005\" after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe hurricane then roared north through southwest Georgia and was on Thursday setting its sights on North and South Carolina, states that are still reeling from historic flooding left by Hurricane Florence last month.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted he was hearing \"stunning\" reports of damage, including that \"Mexico Beach is gone\" and the \"damage in Panama City is catastrophic.\"\n\nAs the sun rises on NW #Florida the early reports I am getting on damage is stunning.

An 11-year-old girl was killed when part of a metal carport crashed into her family's trailer in Lake Seminole and struck her in the head, local officials said.\n\nHundreds of thousands in the state were without power Thursday.\n\nSeminole County is \"pitch black,\" in \"complete and total devastation,\" Travis Brooks, director of Seminole County's Emergency Management Agency told ABC News.\n\nOur crews are working all across the Metro to clear the water off of the roadways left from Hurricane Michael.

When a hurricane reaches 157 mph, it is a Category 5, the highest.\n\nAs the storm's fierce winds pushed ocean water onto the Panhandle's Mexico Beach, ABC News' Ginger Zee said she saw an \"entire home, a well-built home, rolling down the street. ...

Popular with tourists for its beaches, the area also has many year-round residents. Its largest city is Pensacola, with a population approaching half a million.\n\nDo not take any chances.

Rubio tweeted.\n\nHe described Mexico Beach as an \"old old Florida town\" that \"feels like a trip back in time to a place unspoiled by development.\n\n\"It will take a long time to recover from this. We will do everything we can to make sure the federal government does it\u2019s part,\" the senator tweeted. \"But I will confess that my biggest fear that this part of Florida, with its unique & genuine characteristics, will never be the same.\"\n\nIt will take a long time to recover from this.

Those who remained were urged to shelter in place.\n\nKrista Miller, who stayed behind in her 111-year-old home in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, told \"Good Morning America,\" \"it sounded like a freight train coming from every direction.\"\n\nColleen Swab, her mother and her young daughter took shelter in a closet in Panama City Beach, Florida.\n\n\"We were terrified but there was nowhere for us to go, we couldn't get on the roads, it was too late,\" Swab said. \"I thought the roof was going to come off.

Michael strengthened to a Category 4 in just a few hours.\n\nRed Cross officials said they expect shelter population to swell to 20,000 by Thursday or Friday.\n\nThe storm \"grew into a monster,\" President Donald Trump said Wednesday from the Oval Office.\n\nDespite the storm, Trump headed to his planned Wednesday night rally in Pennsylvania, telling reporters, \"We have thousands of people lined up. ... It would have been very unfair.\"\n\nTrump said later from the rally, \"Our thoughts and prayers on behalf of the nation to everyone out there in the path of Hurricane Michael. ... All of Pennsylvania and America sends its unwavering love and support.\"\n\nTrump said he is working closely with governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama and Georgia to provide resources and support from the federal government.\n\nTrump added, \"I\u2019ll be traveling to Florida very, very shortly, and I just want to wish them all the best.

About 375,000 people were under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders across parts of 18 Florida counties, according to The Associated Press. While it's life-threatening for residents, the Gulf Coast's refineries -- which turn crude oil into gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel -- were mostly out of the storm's path.\n\n\"The storm's path appears to be taking it well east of most of the GoM [Gulf of Mexico] production, so we expect a relatively quick return post-storm, though we will have to wait for word on damage,\" Paul Sankey, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, wrote in a research note to clients Wednesday morning.\n\nDespite dramatic storm images and precautionary measures, there were healthy supplies of oil inventories in the U.S. Gulf Coast prior to the storm. In recent years, fracking has chipped away at the Gulf Coast's dominance in U.S. oil production.\n\n\"There is plenty of crude oil around, so the Gulf of Mexico platform shutdowns won't do much,\" David Hackett, co-founder of energy consulting firm Stillwater Associates, told ABC News. There's no threat to gasoline output since most facilities in the Gulf Coast\u2019s refinery row are still up and running, he added.\n\n\"Chevron Pascagoula, the easternmost of the Gulf Coast refineries, shut down but the rest of the refining fleet is running,\" Hackett said. \"The hurricane shouldn't have a big impact on the pipelines that carry gasoline from Houston to New York. Some stations may have run-outs as consumers fill up, but I don't expect widespread fuel outages.\"\n\nA Chevron Pascagoula Refinery spokeswoman told ABC News, \"While we cannot speculate on any possible impact to operations, we are following our hurricane procedures and are paying close attention to the track and forecast of Hurricane Michael.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the national average price of gasoline was $2.91 per gallon, according to AAA.

Michael Flynn when he was a top adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump and at least one person involved in the late Republican operative Peter Smith\u2019s secretive effort to obtain thousands of Hillary Clinton emails that Smith believed had likely been stolen by Russian hackers, sources told ABC News.\n\nThe emails were included in a cache of documents and records that Smith\u2019s estate turned over to agents working for special counsel Robert Mueller and investigators from Capitol Hill, according to the attorney for Smith\u2019s estate, William Ensing, and congressional sources.\n\nSmith passed away in May 2017, but more than a year and a half after his death, his effort to recover more than 30,000 emails he was convinced had been hacked from Clinton\u2019s personal server remains an active area of interest to investigators.\n\nBefore his death, Smith told The Wall Street Journal he and his colleagues had found five groups of hackers who claimed to have Clinton\u2019s emails, including two groups he believed were Russians, but in the end nothing came of the operation.\n\nPTRSIH/Twitter\n\nA key remaining question, however, is to what extent, if any, Trump campaign officials \u2014 or the candidate himself \u2014 knew about Smith\u2019s effort or aided it.\n\nDocuments Smith used to recruit help, described in the Journal and by purported recruitment target Matt Tait, suggested some connection to top campaign officials, including Flynn.\n\nSmith reportedly told the Journal that he knew Flynn, but never said Flynn was involved.\n\nThe content of the emails between Flynn and the person associated with Smith\u2019s effort has not been made public, but a source close to Flynn dismissed the idea that he was involved in Smith\u2019s operation.\n\n\u201cI think it was a passing relationship at best,\u201d the source said.\n\nToday the Journal reported that Smith met with Flynn in 2015, shortly after Flynn left his job as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe source close to Flynn told ABC News they couldn\u2019t speak to whether Smith had a financial relationship in 2015 with Flynn or the Flynn Intel Group, Flynn\u2019s private intelligence firm.\n\nAn ongoing legal battle over Smith\u2019s estate could shed further light on the relationship.\n\nIn court filings reviewed by ABC News, Ensing, the Smith estate attorney, requested any communications between Flynn and associated organizations, and John Szobocsan, a close associate of Smith. An attorney for Szobocsan did not immediately return a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nAnother filing shows that one of Smith\u2019s business associates, John Purcell, gave a company set up by Smith $20,000 \u201cto advance ongoing research.\u201d\n\nThe company, KLS Research, was formed as part of the Clinton email search, according to Tait, the cyber security expert Smith purportedly tried to recruit.\n\nPurcell has taken legal action against Smith\u2019s estate to recoup the funds and then some after he said the funds were \u201cmisappropriated\u201d for Smith\u2019s \u201cpersonal use.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Purcell has not responded to ABC News\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nFlynn, who briefly served as national security adviser to Trump, pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to federal agents.

But the FBI has yet to reach a conclusion on McCabe's proposed revelations, so the book's publication date has now been pushed back to February 2019, according to McCabe.\n\n\"I am disappointed that we have had to substantially delay the publication date for my book because the FBI's review has taken far longer than they led me to believe it would,\" McCabe said in a statement to ABC News. \"Having been singled out for irregular, unfair treatment over the past year, I am concerned that it could be happening again.\"\n\nA source familiar with the matter -- an associate of McCabe who was not authorized to speak on the record -- said McCabe's team and FBI officials have exchanged \"countless calls and emails,\" but there is still \"zero clarity\" about what the source described as a review that \"has gone outside of the norms and protocol of pre-publication review.\"\n\nFBI policy states that in order \"to protect national security and ensure the effective enforcement of federal laws,\" FBI personnel must submit \"any proposed disclosure of FBI information\" to the agency for approval.\n\nPre-publication review \"in general\" is completed within 30 business days, but \"additional time may be necessary for sensitive, voluminous, or technical submissions,\" and, \"When a submission contains operational or intelligence matters, it is unrealistic to assume the proposed disclosure will be reviewed within 30 business days,\" according to an FBI policy guide posted online.\n\nMcCabe's former boss, James Comey, announced in November last year that he would be releasing a book, which was then published in late April, nearly six months later. McCabe's book was announced last month, and now it's expected to be published five months later.\n\nNevertheless, the FBI policy guide states, \"If the review requires additional additional time, [the FBI] will provide periodic progress reports and will advise the submitter of the anticipated completion date.\"\n\nMcCabe has not been advised of an anticipated completion date, according to the source familiar with the matter. But in his statement to ABC News, McCabe said, \"I am looking forward to sharing my story with the public, and now look forward to doing so in February.\"\n\nThe source familiar with the matter raised the specter that politics could be at play, saying McCabe's team is \"concerned that the book delay is due to political anxiety\" over recent news reports disclosing that McCabe kept notes of a Justice Department meeting last year in which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein mentioned the possibility of secretly recording President Donald Trump or trying to remove him from office.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on the suggestion that politics could be holding up McCabe's book, and the agency also declined to comment on the review process at all. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rosenstein's tenure at the Justice Department has appeared to be in peril, but after speaking with Rosenstein earlier this week, Trump insisted the pair \"actually get along\" and said he was not planning to fire Rosenstein anytime soon.\n\nThree weeks ago, the New York Times first reported that at a May 2017 meeting between Rosenstein and then acting-FBI director McCabe, Rosenstein suggested that someone wear a wire when speaking with the president, according to memos McCabe made of the conversation, sources familiar with them told ABC News. During the meeting, Rosenstein also raised the possibility of using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, two sources familiar with the meeting said.\n\nThe meeting took place a week after Trump fired James Comey as director of the FBI.\n\nIn a second meeting later in the day, with others present including then-FBI attorney Lisa Page, Rosenstein again raised the idea of putting a wire on someone to record Trump, the sources said. Some in the room left the meeting believing he was joking about the wire idea, but McCabe and Page left the room thinking otherwise, according to the sources.\n\nAfter news reports of McCabe's memos first surfaced, Rosenstein issued a statement saying, \"I never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false.\"\n\nAt the time, McCabe's attorneys issued a statement acknowledging that McCabe \"drafted memos to memorialize significant discussions he had with high-level officials,\" adding that McCabe preserved the memos \"so he would have an accurate, contemporaneous record of those discussions.\" McCabe's attorneys also said that McCabe gave \"all of his memos\" to Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year, but McCabe \"has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos.\"\n\nMcCabe was fired from the FBI in March after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general concluded that McCabe misled investigators looking into how Justice Department and FBI officials handled matters associated with the 2016 presidential election. McCabe has defended his actions, insisting he did his best to relay accurate information to those investigators.\n\nTrump has often attacked McCabe as emblematic of political bias within the FBI.\n\nIn a statement issued when his upcoming book was first announced, McCabe said, \"I wrote this book because the president's attacks on me symbolize his destructive effect on the country as a whole. He is undermining America's safety and security, and eroding public confidence in its institutions. His attacks on the most crucial institutions of government, and on the professionals who serve within them, should make every American stand up and take notice.\"\n\nAt the time, McCabe's publisher, St. Martin's Press, said it expected McCabe's book \"to be a seminal record of our times.\"",

Add Interest\n\nChina said Thursday that accusations against an alleged Chinese spy accused of attempting to steal trade secrets from American aviation and aerospace companies were \"made out of thin air.\"\n\nYanjun Xu, an operative of China's Ministry of State Security, was charged Wednesday in Cincinnati, Ohio, after being extradited to the U.S. from Belgium.\n\nForeign ministry spokesman Lu Kang dismissed the allegations and called on the U.S. to deal with the matter \"fairly in accordance with law\" and ensure Xu's \"legitimate rights and interests.\"\n\n\"The U.S. accusation is something made out of thin air,\" Lu told reporters at a daily news briefing.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Xu of recruiting experts from major aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, and persuading them to travel to China under the guise that they would give a presentation at a university. The trips were actually attempts to obtain secrets, according to the allegations.\n\nThe indictment said Xu recruited a GE Aviation employee, who sent him a presentation in February that contained the company's proprietary information. Xu later asked the employee for specific technical information and then asked him to meet in Europe, where he wanted the worker to provide additional information from GE, according to court papers.\n\nXu was arrested after traveling to Belgium in April. U.S. federal authorities said it is the first time that a Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence officer has been extradited to the United States for trial.\n\nJohn Demers, the assistant attorney general in charge of national security, said the case was a \"significant economic espionage matter\" and the latest proof China is trying to steal information from American companies.\n\nBenjamin Glassman, U.S. attorney for Ohio's southern district, said no military information was targeted, but any attempt by other countries to \"grow companies at America's expense\" is considered a threat to national security.\n\nThe case comes amid a brewing trade war sparked largely by U.S. accusations China coerces foreign companies into handing over technology in return for access to the Chinese market.\n\nThe two have also feuded over U.S. support for Taiwan, Chinese weapons purchases from Russia and China's territorial claims in the South China Sea \u2014 where the U.S. says a Chinese destroyer came aggressively close to a U.S. Navy ship late last month, forcing it to maneuver to prevent a collision.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence also charged last week in a strongly worded speech that China was seeking through covert and overt means to interfere in the U.S. midterm elections and counter President Donald Trump's tough trade policies toward Beijing.\n\nTrump has made similar accusations, although intelligence and homeland security experts said they didn't know of any Chinese influence operations akin to Russian activities during the 2016 presidential election.",

  "text": "The Trump administration is finalizing its plan for schools to deal with sexual assault allegations, according to advocacy groups and college officials who have met privately with senior government officials.\n\nInterested in Trump Administration? Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe proposal, known as rules for Title IX -- the civil rights law that prohibits gender discrimination in a person's education -- is widely expected to limit the scope of inquiries by colleges and universities and make it easier for students accused of misconduct to push back.\n\nDrafted by the Department of Education and under review by President Donald Trump's budget office, the proposal is likely to spark heated debate. It follows the bruising confirmation fight for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault at a house party when he was in high school three decades ago. Two other women made similar accusations. Kavanaugh vehemently denied all of them.\n\nThe revised guidelines are being pushed by a small group of advocates who have told Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and other high-ranking government officials in private meetings that they believe male students are often falsely accused and face expulsion from colleges and universities with little due process.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe Department of Education declined to comment.\n\nThe New York Times first obtained a draft of the proposal this summer, and at least one version has since been posted online.\n\nAdvocacy groups involved in the ongoing discussions said among the provisions they expect to see in the final draft is one that wouldn't require schools to investigate incidents that occur off campus, even if it involves students. Another provision would put schools on the hook to investigate allegations only if they're made to certain designated authorities, such as the school's Title IX coordinator. And the new rules would likely allow for more thorough cross-examinations, possibly requiring that the person making the allegation sit in the same room as the accused.\n\nCynthia P. Garrett, co-president of a group called \"Families Advocating for Campus Equality,\" said she's been pushing for these changes because they give students accused of misconduct better opportunities to defend themselves.\n\n\"I don't want to make it difficult for people who claim to be victims to come forward. But it shouldn't be easy either,\" she told ABC News. \"I think there should be a threshold for evidence or proof before you ruin someone's life.\"\n\nGarrett, who also works with a similar advocacy group called SAVE, said she met with budget officials last week on the subject, a follow up to a meeting last year with DeVos. In 2017, DeVos convened several \"listening sessions\" with various stakeholders, including college Title IX officers and victims' rights groups, as well as FACE and SAVE.\n\nVictims' rights advocates argue that DeVos is downplaying the problem of sexual violence on college campuses. They argue the new approach would unfairly tilt investigations in favor of the perpetrator and dramatically reduce the number of women willing to come forward.\n\n\"It limits the responsibilities of schools to respond to sexual assault ... and it doesn't take into consideration trauma\" of the victim, said Shiwali Patel, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, who up until this summer was working at the Education Department's civil rights office on this issue.\n\nAt stake are the billions of dollars a year the federal government gives to schools. To qualify, schools have to meet requirements under Title IX, the 1972 civil rights law that prohibits gender discrimination in any education program that receives federal funding. Under Title IX, sexual harassment and sexual assault is a form of unlawful discrimination.\n\nOne major sticking point in the debate is disagreement on how widespread the problem of sexual assault really is. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the most recent assessment on sexual assault on colleges is from 2016. That survey across nine diverse colleges and universities found that 25 percent of women reported that they had experienced unwanted and nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college. But the study notes that it didn't collect details on the incident, such as the type of sexual contact.\n\nSo how common are false allegations? The same office reported it doesn't have that information and could only point to an FBI estimate from 22 years ago. That report estimated false accusations account for only 8 percent of cases.\n\nBut a 2016 government report warned that statistics on sexual assault can be tricky because studies depend on who's surveyed, what questions are asked and whether women feel emboldened to answer truthfully.\n\nThat statistical void has paved the way for both sides to speak about sexual violence in deeply partisan terms.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images, FILE\n\nLast year, DeVos announced plans to replace Obama-era guidance and blamed a \"failed system\" for the \"hundreds upon hundreds of cases\" filed with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights.\n\n\"Instead of working with schools on behalf of students, the prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights to work against schools and against students,\" she said.\n\nHelping to lead the effort under DeVos has been Candice Jackson, who wrote a 2005 book detailing assault allegations against former President Bill Clinton. She later swung behind Trump's candidacy despite reports that he faced his own allegations of sexual assault.\n\nGarrett insists her push for new rules isn't partisan. But she argues that Obama-era guidelines were ensnaring \"Eagle Scouts\" and \"highly intelligent\" kids, rather than \"predators.\" She also blames what she describes as extreme feminist ideology on college campuses that encourages women to see themselves as victims when, she said, the case probably involves \"two drunk kids having sex.\"\n\nWomen's rights advocates including Patel counter that this kind of rhetoric grossly distorts the realities of sexual assault on college campuses.\n\n\"The reality of it is that so few false accusations actually occur, and the number of survivors of sexual assault is really high,\" Patel said. \"That's the issue we should be talking about.\"\n\nJennifer McCary, Title IX coordinator for Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, which recently hosted a conference on the subject, said she expects every administration to put its stamp on the issue.\n\nBut one point she'd like to see addressed is how the Education Department wants schools to respond if students come to them with off-campus allegations of assault -- if the final rules exclude off-campus sites, as expected.\n\nAnd, she said, there can probably be alternative ways to ensure a person accused of sexual misconduct is given due process without requiring both people sit in a room for a cross-examination.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to turn our students away because it didn't happen in our jurisdiction,\" McCary said. Above all, she added, any regulation \"should be supportive of all of our students.\"",

  "text": "More than a week after a prominent Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist went missing, President Donald Trump has spoken to Saudi officials \"at the highest level\" to press them on his disappearance, he said Wednesday.\n\nInterested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nTrump declined to comment on whether he would hold the Saudis responsible, saying, \"I have to find out who did it.\" But he said the U.S. is demanding answers: \"We're demanding everything, we want to see what's going on here.\"\n\nCritics have accused the White House of being slow to react to Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance and hesitant to criticize the Saudi government, a close partner of the Trump administration, amid reports that U.S. intelligence reportedly knew ahead of time of a plot to capture him.\n\nWhile the Trump administration's response has been muted -- said to be waiting for more details -- Congress has been expressing outrage for a week now, with Republicans and Democrats warning this could be a breaking point for the U.S.-Saudi relationship and triggering an investigation that could lead to sanctions on Saudi Arabia, an unprecedented move.\n\nA vocal critic of the kingdom's rulers, Khashoggi went missing last Tuesday after he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, for routine paperwork. Surveillance footage released by the Turkish government shows him entering the consulate, but they say there is no evidence he left afterward, leading Turkish officials to say they believe he was killed.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nThe head of the Turkish-Arab Media Association alleges that Khashoggi was killed and dismembered, his body parts then being removed from the consulate.\n\nABC News has not verified any of those startling claims. The Saudi government has fiercely denied any involvement in his disappearance, saying he left the compound and went missing afterward.\n\nIn his first extensive remarks about Khashoggi's case, Trump took a tougher line on the Saudis, calling it \"a very sad situation. It's a very bad situation. And we want to get to the bottom of it ... I'm not happy about this.\"\n\n\"We cannot let this happen -- to reporters, to anybody,\" he added during an Oval Office meeting with the Secretary of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator.\n\nIn addition to Trump's call, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Senior Adviser Jared Kushner spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the real power behind his father King Salman, on Tuesday, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo following up in a separate call \"to reiterate the United States request for information,\" according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nAll three officials pressed MBS, as the Crown Prince is known, for more details and urged his government to support a transparent investigation, Sanders added.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Wednesday the U.S. is \"ready to assist in every way,\" but the State Department wouldn't say if an actual offer of assistance was made to the Turkish government as it investigates.\n\nIn addition to the Saudis, State Department officials have also been in touch with Turkish authorities, but the agency's deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino wouldn't say whether Turkey has shared any of its findings with the U.S. -- declining to get ahead of their investigation, even as Turkish officials have leaked details of it to the press.\n\nThat's because Turkey wants U.S. support before it accuses Saudi Arabia, an important trading partner, of a murder plot, according to analysts who spoke with ABC News, and the Turks are nervous that the U.S. will not come to their support because of its close ties to MBS. It has vouched for the Saudis on their bombing campaign in Yemen and refused to pick a side between Canada and Saudi Arabia in their diplomatic row over human rights.\n\nBut to many on Capitol Hill, this could mark a turning point. Twenty-two senators, including every member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but two, signed a letter to Trump Wednesday that requires him to now conduct an investigation within 120 days to determine if someone violated Khashoggi's human rights and, if so, sanction anyone found responsible. Those violations include torture, prolonged detention without charges, abduction, or killing.\n\n\"If Saudi Arabia took a U.S. resident, lured him into a consulate and killed him, it's time for the United States to rethink our military, political, and economic relationship with Saudi Arabia,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat.\n\nSeveral Republicans agreed, even those who've had closer ties or warmer words for the Saudis and the young Crown Prince who many have painted as a reformer.\n\n\"If it plays out that the Saudi Arabian government has mistreated this man because of his dissident voice in Istanbul, it will be a game changer for me,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said, with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., telling reporters if the allegations are true, \"It'll have a dramatic and negative impact on our bilateral relationship.\n\nSome called for the president to do more: \"What we need now is for the president to get serious about questioning Saudi Arabia and letting them know what information is out there and asking them to explain. I've heard no good explanation so far,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.\n\nHasan Jamali, File/AP Photo\n\nIt's unclear what the U.S. knows about Khashoggi's disappearance, but Trump did cast some doubt on the reports that Khashoggi was murdered.\n\n\"Nobody knows what happened yet. They don't know over there,\" he said, although it's unclear if he meant the Saudis did not know or if Turkish authorities who are investigating still do not know.\n\nBut U.S. intelligence reportedly intercepted communications between Saudi officials discussing a plan to capture him, the Washington Post reported Wednesday.\n\n\"Although I cannot comment on intelligence matters, I can say definitively the United States had no advance knowledge of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance,\" Palladino said in response during a department press briefing -- notably not commenting on any capture operation.\n\nGiven the elaborate details of the reported plot, the U.S. must have known something, according to Ned Price, a former special assistant to President Obama on the National Security Council staff and someone who also worked at the CIA.\n\n\"It seems rather implausible that no one knew something like this was coming, and the question then becomes what was done about it,\" he told ABC News. \"Did they perform their duty to warn function, or was that duty to warn overridden in this case because of this administration's close and cozy relationship with the Saudis?\"\n\nAfter Khashoggi's fiance wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post, pleading for Trump and his wife Melania's help, the president said that the first lady's office was working on inviting her to the White House.\n\nABC News's Ben Siegel contributed to this report from Capitol Hill.",

  "text": "Transcript for Melania Trump weighs in on the #MeToo movement\n\nWe move to ABC's interview with the first lady, chief national affairs correspondent Tom llamas traveled with Melania trump on her first solo trip to Africa and she addressed several sensitive topics including the me too movement. Tom is here. Good morning. We sat do you know with the first lady in Kenya but we were with her every step of the way during her tour through four African countries seeing firsthand how this first lady is trying to make her mark. On the road from Cairo to Giza we see them and guarding every stretch of highway. We're in an armored van traveling in the first lady's motorcade. Mrs. Trump's first solo trip abroad means ovary step will be guarded. In Egypt, the first lady touring some of history's greatest landmarks. At times appearing to make these monuments part of her own personal runway. In many ways like the great sphinx she visited Melania trump also remains a mystery but now for the first time opening up about her life and her time in the white house during our exclusive sit-down interview and revealing some of the obstacles she's faced. What's the most surprising thing about being first lady for you? It's sad to see that organizations and foundations I want to partner with choose not to because of the administration and I feel they are choosing the politics over helping others. Can you give me any examples? I would not talk about it. They know who they are. I don't want to put them out in front of the world but they know who they are. Reporter: In our interview we also asked the first lady about some of the major events that have shaped and rocked her husband's white house. And the country, including the me too movement. Think of your son, think of your husband. I've had many false accusations. Reporter: Just last week her husband sharing that as the FBI investigated judge Brett Kavanaugh over an accusation of high school sexual assault. What is your take about the me too movement, though? Do you believe in them? Do you support the me too movement? I support the women and they need to be heard. We need to support them and also men, not just women. Do you think men in the news that have been accused of sexual assault have been treated unfairly. We need to have hard evidence that, you know, that if you are accused of something, show the evidence. Some women might hear that and say how can you say that. You need to stand with women. I do stand with women but we need to show the evidence. You cannot just say to somebody, I was, you know, sexually assaulted and or you did that to me or -- because sometimes the media goes too far and the way they portray some stories, it's not correct. It's not right. We spoke much more about the me too movement along with other current issues. No question was off the table and tomorrow right here on \"Gma\" why she personally wanted to take on cyberbullying. It's likely not what you think. Her revelation shocked us. Can't wait for that. \"Being Melania: The first lady\" airs Friday at 10:00 P.M. Right here on ABC.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.",

  "text": "Transcript for Trump faces surprise resignation of UN ambassador\n\nsurprise resignation of U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. She's the 12th senior official to leave the administration this year. Speculation swirling about why the rising GOP star is making the move just weeks before midterm elections. Cecilia Vega has all the latest. Good morning, Cecilia. Reporter: Good morning to you. President trump says Haley told him she wanted off the job six months ago but this surprise announcement caught some top administration officials by surprise. President trump back on the campaign trail. This is truly a historic week for America. Reporter: Using his recent supreme court victory to rally supporters in Iowa and stoke anger at Democrats. What the Democrats did to Brett and his beautiful family is a national embarrassment, a national disgrace. Reporter: But that victory lap overshadowed by the latest shake-up back home. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley caught even some top administration officials off guard with her surprise resignation announcement. President trump says, no hard feelings. I think she's helped make it a much better position if you want to know the truth. I think it's become maybe a more glamorous position than it was two years ago. Reporter: She was also one of the few women in the president's cabinet. Someone who didn't hesitate to publicly disagree with him saying this about the women accusing the president of sexual misconduct. They should be heard and they should be dealt with. Reporter: As for why she's leaving now, Haley is not saying. There's no personal reasons. I think that it's just very important for government officials to understand when it's time to step aside. Reporter: The one thing she says not on the horizon. No, I am not running for 2020. I can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one. Reporter: She had a special message for two people who were right there in the room. Jared is such a hidden genius that no one understands. And ivanka has been just a great friend. Reporter: Now among the names being floated as a possible Haley replacement, Ivanka Trump. Ivanka would be dynamite. Is it a serious consideration? I think ivanka would be incredible. It doesn't mean I'd pick her because you'd be accused of nepotism. Even though I'm not sure there's anybody more confident in the world but that's okay. Reporter: And just like that Ivanka Trump took herself out of the running with a tweet saying, I am not that replacement so we can cross that name off the list. So she's off the list. Who is on it? Well, the president says he has a list of about five names long. We know among them is deputy -- former deputy national security director Dina Powell. One of the names on the list. The president says he wants to name this replacement over the next two to three weeks, George. That could make for a pretty long, awkward transition since Haley says she's not leaving until the end of the year. No confirmation till after the elections. Thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.",

  "text": "Police have released body camera videos showing a controversial traffic stop during which two college students were taken into custody at gunpoint in Glassboro, New Jersey.\n\nThe Glassboro Police Department on Tuesday released more than two hours of footage from 13 officer body-worn cameras showing the Oct. 1 incident, from start to finish.\n\n\"The videos are being offered in the spirit of complete transparency and to demonstrate the Police Department\u2019s compliance with appropriate protocols and training for dealing with this type of incident,\" Glassboro Police Chief Franklin Brown, Jr., said in a statement.\n\nThe footage begins with officers investigating a shoplifting report at a mobile phone store located within the Collegetown Shopping Center in Glassboro, a borough in Gloucester County, around 4:30 p.m. local time. Suddenly, a man runs into the shop and tells the officers he just saw someone with a handgun get into a black Dodge Charger parked at the shopping center and drive off.\n\n\"Officer, see that Charger right there? He just came out of the store with a gun in his hand. I don't know if it's fake, I don't know if it's a joke,\" the witness says in the video.\n\n\"This store?\" one of the officers asks.\n\n\"He came out of a store with a gun in his hand and walked into the car with a gun,\" the witness says, later telling police that he was \"one-thousand percent\" certain the individual was holding a \"black gun.\"\n\nWPVI\n\nThe officers dash out of the shop and into their marked vehicles, while radioing to fellow officers. The officers pursue the Charger until it eventually stops in a parking lot on Rowan University's campus.\n\nSeveral officers get out of their vehicles and draw their guns at the Charger while taking cover behind their own cars. Inside the Charger were two Rowan University students, according to police.\n\n\"Put your hands out the window -- do it now!\" one officer yells.\n\n\"Driver, roll down all the windows with your left hand -- do it now!\" he yells again. \"All passengers put your hands up -- do it now!\"\n\nWPVI\n\nThe driver, a young black man, follows the officers' orders. He gets out of the Charger with his hands in the air, slowly walks backwards to the officers, gets down on his knees and puts his hands behind his back, while officers keep their guns drawn.\n\nAn officer then places him in handcuffs and tells him he's \"being detained right now.\"\n\n\"For what?\" the driver asks repeatedly. \"I swear to God, y'all better have a valid reason for this s--t.\"\n\n\"For what?\" the officer retorts, while patting him down.\n\n\"For what?\" the driver says back. \"Y'all got all these cop cars on us, what the f--k happened?\"\n\nWPVI\n\nThe officer places the driver in the back of a police SUV, while the other officers yell to the passenger in the Charger to follow the same commands. By this point, a number of onlookers have gathered nearby and stop to watch the incident unfold.\n\nThe passenger, a young black woman, is also placed in handcuffs. She tells the officers \"there's nobody else in the car.\"\n\n\"What is going on?\" she asks.\n\nAn officer pats her down, asking her, \"Do you have anything on you?\"\n\n\"No, I have my phone and a lip gloss,\" she responds. \"Can you tell us what we did, please?\"\n\n\"You're just being detained right now,\" the officer says.\n\n\"For what?\" she asks.\n\n\"You're being detained, we'll tell you in a second,\" the officer says, placing her in the back of a separate police SUV.\n\nWPVI\n\nThe footage also shows the moment an officer tells the driver why he's being detained and asks for consent to search his vehicle to check for a weapon.\n\n\"Search my vehicle, go ahead!\" the driver yells, still handcuffed in the back of the police SUV. \"Go check my vehicle!\"\n\nAnother young man, who tells police he's the driver's brother, is on scene to calm him down and vouch for him to police.\n\n\"Officer, you'd be upset too if you got pulled over and got accused for having a gun and you didn't have a gun,\" the brother says.\n\n\"I'm sure I would but -- listen, I'm not questioning the fact that he's upset,\" the officer responds. \"But you have to understand from our point of view, as well. So somebody said if somebody had a gun, we're not just going to walk up on a car.\"\n\n\"I understand that,\" the brother replies. \"But the way some of your officers were acting was just ridiculous.\"\n\n\"It's not ridiculous because we have a family to go home to,\" the officer says. \"We have a protocol and we have a procedure we follow when we do stuff like this. We don't want to shoot anybody.\"\n\nWPVI\n\nMeanwhile, another officer talks to the detained driver, who explains that he was picking up his glasses from and eyeglass store and is now missing class.\n\n\"I'm a student here,\" the driver tells the officer. \"Making me look crazy in front of all my peers.\"\n\n\"He ain't making it to class 'cause we thought he had a gun,\" the driver says, appearing to mock police. \"He didn't have a gun. We got a black student on campus. We hear this story every day on the news. I'm tired of this s--t, bro.\"\n\nNo gun was found in the vehicle and the students were ultimately released, police said.\n\nThe Glassboro police chief said his officers \"utilized their training and followed established protocol to ensure the safety of everyone involved in this incident.\"\n\nBut the students, identified by ABC affiliate WPVI as Altaif Hassan and Giavanna Roberson, said they feared for their lives.\n\nHassan, a senior at Rowan University, shared his experience with students and faculty at a public forum that was held on campus last Friday in response to the Oct. 1 incident.\n\n\"I'm mentally playing this back over and over again, day in and day out since it happened,\" Hassan said. \"I think that I'm going to still think about it until this is over, until something get done. Something got to change.\"\n\nThe Glassboro Police Department apparently declined an invitation to attend the forum.\n\n\"They told us that they were not available today,\" Rbrey Singleton, a Rowan University senior and president of the student government association, told WPVI.\n\nUpon releasing the body camera videos, the Glassboro police chief said in a statement Tuesday that borough authorities and university officials will \"form a committee that will meet on a regular basis to communicate and dialog to form a bridge to move forward.\"\n\nPolice did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for additional comment on Wednesday.",

Add Interest\n\nThe front-runner in Brazil's presidential runoff announced Wednesday that he will skip the first TV debate before the Oct. 28 election as he recovers from being stabbed.\n\nDoctors for far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro said he was not fit enough to participate in Thursday's debate. He has skipped other debates since being stabbed at a Sept. 6 campaign rally before the opening round of the presidential contest.\n\nBolsonaro, who left the hospital Sept. 29, won Sunday's first round by getting 46 percent of the votes. He was followed by left-leaning Fernando Haddad at 29 percent, and they advanced to the runoff.\n\nBolsonaro's doctors said he will have another physical evaluation Oct. 18, and a decision will be made then on whether he will be able to show up at remaining debates.\n\nTV Band said later that it plans to host its presidential debate on Oct. 19.\n\nIt is not mandatory for Brazilian presidential election candidates to participate in debates.\n\nHaddad told reporters that he would go to a hospital to debate Bolsonaro if needed.\n\n\"He has to debate. I am willing to go to a hospital to debate him,\" Haddad said. \"He said he doesn't want to be under stress. I will not stress him. I will speak in the calmest way possible. I won't raise my voice. I won't even look at him if that is something that worries him.\"\n\nBolsonaro, meanwhile, jabbed at Haddad on Twitter, calling him a \"puppet of a jailed crook.\"\n\n\"Your time is coming,\" the former army officer wrote to Haddad.\n\nFormer President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is in jail, was barred from running due to a corruption conviction and he picked Haddad to replace him as the Workers' Party candidate.\n\nLast Thursday, while six candidates debated on TV Globo, Bolsonaro gave an interview to competitor TV Record. Since winning the first round, his communication has been mostly via social media and interviews with friendly media outlets.\n\nThe first Datafolha poll after the first-round was published, with Bolsonaro with a big lead.\n\nThe far-right candidate garnered 58 percent, with Haddad at 42 points. The poll interviewed 3,235 people on Wednesday and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.\n\nHaddad was endorsed by defeated left-leaning candidate Ciro Gomes, who finished third with 12 percent in Sunday's vote, and his Brazilian Labor Party. Labor union leaders did the same. All those moves were widely expected.\n\nThe candidate also said he was visited by members of the right-wing Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which had rivaled the Workers' Party in presidential elections since 1994.\n\nGeraldo Alckmin, who ran as the Social Democracy candidate in the latest election, got less than 5 percent of the vote.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, The Associated Press obtained documents showing that federal prosecutors are investigating Bolsonaro's economic adviser as part of a probe into fraud at the pension funds of several state companies. Bolsonaro has made fighting corruption a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nThe documents say there is \"relevant circumstantial evidence\" that Paulo Guedes may have participated in fraud. In the documents, prosecutors noted that a fund managed by Guedes invested in a company that later bought another enterprise that may have been a shell and that repeatedly posted losses.\n\nIn a statement, Guedes' lawyers denied he ever did anything illegal or unethical in his role at the fund and said the fund had provided pension funds with good returns on their investment. They called the timing of the investigation \"an affront to democracy whose principal goal is to confuse the voter.\"\n\nBolsonaro, who is heavily favored by Brazil's financial markets, had the opposite impact Wednesday. The candidate said in interviews that his privatization plans were more modest than brokers expected, which led Sao Paulo's stock market to fall 2.79 percent.",

  "text": "A woman is battling corruption charges in London after allegedly racking up $21 million at Harrods department store using 35 credit cards during a decades-long spending spree.\n\nZamira Hajiyeva, the wife of a jailed banker from Azerbaijan, is being asked to explain her \"unexplained wealth\" thanks to a new anti-corruption enforcement scheme designed to target organized crime figures and others with foreign government ties.\n\nUnexplained Wealth Orders are designed to target individuals who are unable to account for \u00a350,000 (U.S. $66,000) or more of their wealth and are a civil -- not criminal --action. Targeted individuals must be able to trace their income to a legitimate source or face severe financial penalties.\n\nJack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nAt an earlier court hearing, a lawyer for Britain's National Crime Agency gave details of Hajiyeva's spending at Harrods, which allegedly included one occasion where she dropped \u00a3150,000 ($198,000) in a single visit. The National Crime Agency said Hajiyeva's spending amounted to $2.1 million a year between 2006 and 2016.\n\nHajiyeva has denied any wrongdoing and is working to overturn the two Unexplained Wealth Orders, the AP reported.\n\nHer lawyers said in a statement that the issuing of the orders \"does not and should not be taken to imply any wrong-doing, whether on her part or that of her husband,\" according to the AP.\n\nHer lawyers added that the order \"is part of an investigative process, not a criminal procedure, and it does not involve the finding of any criminal offense,\" according to the AP.\n\nHajiyeva used 35 credit cards linked to her husband's employer, the Bank of Azerbaijan, to finance her lifestyle, the AP reported.\n\nWhile she had previously been called \"Mrs. A\" in court filings, Hajiyeva had her named publicly released this week after she lost a court appeal to stay anonymous while she defends herself on two Unexplained Wealth Orders related to her spending and real-estate holdings.\n\nHajiyeva\u2019s husband is Jahangir Hajiyev, the former head of the state bank of Azerbaijan who was sentenced to 15 years in jail after being convicted on fraud and embezzlement charges in 2016, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFile-Nelson Ching/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nTargeting money laundering\n\nJohn Penrose was named the country's anti-corruption champion by Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017. He said the Unexplained Wealth Orders are the start of a crackdown on money laundering in the U.K.\n\n\"Nobody knows precisely how much dirty money is trying to be laundered through Britain because London is one of the biggest financial centers in the world,\" Penrose told ABC News.\n\nHe added that it \"only takes a fraction of 1 percent of that to be dirty to be a large figure.\"\n\nUnexplained Wealth Orders have \"the potential to significantly reduce the appeal of the UK as a destination for illicit income,\" Donald Toon, the director for economic crime at the National Crime Agency, said in a statement.\n\n\"They enable the U.K. to more effectively target the problem of money laundering through prime real estate in London and across the U.K.,\u201d Toon added, \"and we will now seek to move further cases to the High Court.\"\n\nHajiyeva's property in the wealthy London area of Knightsbridge is also under investigation, according to the National Crime Agency, which said it was bought through a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, a well-known tax haven. The property is valued at \u00a311.5 million, or more than U.S. $15 million.\n\nA second, first-of-its-kind Unexplained Wealth Order was also filed in relation to her ownership of a $13.5 million golf course, purchased through a different company.\n\nCorruption in the city of London\n\nThe anti-corruption charity Transparency International sent ABC News documents that they say identify \u00a34.4 billion worth of property bought with suspicious money in the U.K. The charity said that there are a total of 86,000 properties owned by companies in secrecy jurisdictions, meaning it is impossible to trace who owns them.\n\nPenrose said transparency is key, saying that he is in favor \"properly transparent register\" for offshore companies, which is set to be introduced in 2020.\n\n\"I\u2019m a huge supporter of publishing a list of anybody who has been found guilty of corrupt offenses,\" Penrose said.\n\n\"We know some of it, but we need to know more,\" he added.\n\nABC News' Kaelyn Forde contributed to this report.",

Two years ago at the Democratic Convention, I warned of those threats,\u201d he shared in a post on Instagram and Twitter.\n\n\u201cToday, I have re-registered as a Democrat-- I had been a member for most of my life-- because we need Democrats to provide the checks and balance our nation so badly needs,\u201d he said.\n\nJust what Bloomberg might be saying about a run for the White House was unclear, though, and his office did not immeidately respond tp a request for a comment.\n\nWednesday's Instagram post follows a report in The Times of London last month that Bloomberg has decided he will run against Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nBloomberg has come out strong against President Trump since the 2016 campaign, calling him a \u201cdangerous demagogue,\u201d and \u201crisky, reckless and radical choice,\u201d in his 2016 DNC endorsement of Hillary Clinton.\n\nEarl Gibson III/Getty Images, FILE\n\nHe\u2019s condemned the Trump administration in his namesake philanthropy\u2019s annual report, saying Washington\u2019s \u201cdirect assault on facts and data is making it harder for America to address major challenges here and around the world.\u201d\n\nIda Mae Astute/ABC via Getty Images\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t been shy about going after Bloomberg, either. Following Bloomberg\u2019s DNC speech, Trump said at a July 2016 rally in Iowa, \u201cI was going to hit one guy in particular, a very little guy,\u201d he said, referring to Bloomberg. He later sent out a few tweets, calling Bloomberg\u2019s previous term as mayor a disaster and saying if he ran again \u201che wouldn\u2019t get 10% of the vote.\u201d\n\n\"Little\" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016\n\nIf Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/759027356434518016)\n\nThat contradicted his 2012 view of Bloomberg.\n\nMike Bloomberg is doing a great job as Mayor of New York City. Ray Kelly is a great Police Commissioner. @MikeBloomberg \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2012\n\nBloomberg was a Democrat until his 2001 mayoral run where he registered as a Republican to succeed Trump's now-lawyer Rudy Giuliani. He spoke to a sizable crowd at the Republican National Convention in 2004, where he and the Bush administration got into a behind the scenes spat about Bloomberg\u2019s speech, in which he wanted to criticize the then-red Congress for its handling of funds after 9/11. His name was even briefly removed from the list of speakers, then re-added once he agreed to remove that portion of his speech.\n\nHe served two terms as a Republican mayor, then registered as an Independent in 2007 prior to his third term in 2009.\n\nHe has danced with the idea of presidential runs in every cycle since 2008, but instead spent millions in supporting largely Democratic candidates. He certainly has the means to do a decent amount of self-funding -- he\u2019s worth $48.1 billion according to Forbes.\n\nThis cycle alone Bloomberg has already pledged up to $100 million to the Democratic Party. He partnered with the main Democratic Senate super PAC, committing $80 million to firmly cement his Democratic stance. The billionaire\u2019s individual super PAC, Independence USA, has spent over $4 million on House candidates in moderate, suburban races.\n\nThe Trump campaign has acknowledged the potential threat from Bloomberg in 2020. Corey Lewandowski, the president\u2019s former campaign manager, told the Christian Science Monitor Bloomberg is the \u201conly one\u201d who could compete with Trump in the future, citing his outsider status, history of job creation and nearly endless-funds.\n\nIn 2016, Giuliani, who endorsed Bloomberg before his mayoral runs in 2000, said in a Fox Business interview that he should run against Clinton in 2016 to embolden more progressive candidates.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s history of flip-flopping parties has fixated him as a left-leaning centrist, which runs the risk of alienating a far liberal base. He\u2019s alienated NYC liberals in the past, defending a \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policy. He\u2019s also questioned eight allegations of sexual assault against news anchor Charlie Rose.\n\nAt the DNC in 2016, he urged Democrats to open their minds to the possibilities of private funding, saying their opposition to private funding stands \u201cin the way of action on education reform and deficit reduction.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also called out Republicans when it comes to anti-immigration policies and their opposition to gun control. His 501C, Everytown for Gun Safety, was an active spender in the 2016 cycle.",

Add Interest\n\nShahad Hussein, the owner of Prestige Limousine, the company that rented out the stretch limo, is currently in Pakistan but he left the day-to-day operations of the company to his son, Nauman Hussain.\n\nHe was charged with criminally negligent homicide, police said.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told ABC News that he is being charged because he put a defective vehicle back on the road and hired a driver he knew was not properly licensed.\n\nHussain pleaded not guilty and was released on bail Wednesday night.\n\nThe family of the driver, Scott Lisinicchia, said that he had a chauffeur's license.\n\nThe development comes shortly after it was revealed that Lisinicchia had been cited in August for operating the same limousine without the proper license, according to the New York State Police.\n\nThe Oct. 6 crash killed Lisinicchia, the 17 passengers and two pedestrians.\n\nLisinicchia's driving history and the safety record of the vehicle are under scrutiny as federal and state officials investigate the crash.\n\nOn Aug. 25, a state trooper with the commercial vehicle enforcement unit stopped a 2001 Ford Excursion stretched limousine in Saratoga Springs. Lisinicchia was behind the wheel.\n\nPeter R. Barber/The Daily Gazette of Schenectady, N.Y.\n\nThe state trooper issued violations Prestige Limousine and advised both Lisinicchia and the company that he \"could not operate the limousine without additional licensure,\" a state police source told ABC News.\n\nThe source said the trooper also took steps to ensure the vehicle was taken off the road, returning it to its original location and directing the driver not to drive the limousine.\n\nThis comes after Lisinicchia's family said he had expressed concerns about the company's cars in the past.\n\nPeter R. Barber/The Daily Gazette of Schenectady, N.Y.\n\nRichard Burke, a spokesperson for the Lisinicchia family, told ABC News that Lisinicchia's wife said \"he had complained to her regarding the condition of some of the vehicles.
