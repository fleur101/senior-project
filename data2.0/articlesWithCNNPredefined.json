When T'Challa -- played by Chadwick Boseman -- appears at the United Nations in the film, he is wearing an Ikir\u00e9 Jones scarf.\n\nIkir\u00e9 Jones created several pieces for the film, but only one -- the silk scarf \"From Wakanda, with Love\" -- made it into the final edit. The scarf is made in Italy and retails for $285.\n\n\"It was pretty stunning to see our work presented on such a large platform,\" said Oyejide.\n\nA reflection of heritage\n\nAfter working as a hip-hop producer collaborating with the likes of Detroit rapper J Dilla, and then training as an attorney, Oyejide founded Ikir\u00e9 Jones in 2012 with tailor Sam Hubler. He had studied with Hubler's sister at law school.\n\n\"It seemed like a natural decision for us to put our talents together,\" said Oyejide, who moved from Nigeria to the United States when he was a teenager. The brand relates to his family story. \"Ikir\u00e9 is a town in Nigeria where my father grew up, [and] Jones is my wife's family name,\" he added.\n\nIkir\u00e9 Jones has established an aesthetic that projects \"nobility and cultural inclusion,\" explained Oyejide. \"Our work blends conventional European silhouettes with bolder colors and fabrics that are inspired by African culture.\"\n\nThe Wakanda effect\n\n\"Black Panther\" made $1 billion at the box office globally within a month of release. Since it opened in the United States in February, Ikir\u00e9 Jones has a seen a fivefold increase in sales, according to Oyejide.\n\nThe boutique brand, which has just two permanent members of staff, sells to customers through its website.\n\n\"We find ourselves having to adjust to the vast increase in scale that we are putting out,\" said Oyejide. \"It's a good challenge for any business to deal with.\"\n\nHe wants his brand to use the spotlight to further its cultural mission.\n\nRelated: Designer bags a spot at Urban Outfitters\n\n\"The brand is essentially a vehicle to change perceptions about immigrants, migrants and vulnerable populations across the globe,\" said Oyejide. \"Each collection references issues that real people are struggling with.

    "text": "When professional footballers retire, some go into coaching while others become TV analysts. Not many produce their own Cognac.\n\nOlivier Tebily spent years on the international football circuit, including a lengthy stint in the English Premier League. The defender also played for his home nation of Ivory Coast.\n\nThe retired footballer, 41, now spends his days tending vineyards in western France, turning grapes into Cognac.\n\nTebily was a toddler when his family moved from Ivory Coast to France. It was there, as a teenager, that he was first introduced to life on a vineyard.\n\nBut what started as a summer job for a young man in search of pocket change would turn into a passion -- and a business.\n\nWhen Tebily signed his first professional contract at the age of 18, one of his first purchases was a few hectares of vineyards.\n\nHis family tended the vines during a football career with stops at clubs in France, Scotland, England and Canada. A highlight was representing Ivory Coast at the the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nRelated: Sofia Vergara is the best-paid actress on TV -- and a business maven\n\nWhen it was time to retire from the sport, Tebily knew where he wanted to be: Back among the vines.\n\n\"The day I decided to stop my career I stopped completely and I switched professions,\" said Tebily. \"I made the choice to stop football and resume my wine making.\"\n\nCognac is a special spirit. Renowned for its richness, the brandy can only be made from white grapes in the Cognac region of France. Popular brands include Hennessy and Courvoisier.\n\nTebily said it was hard to get started in the insular business, which produces annual exports worth $3.5 billion.\n\n\"For me to enter a world of viticulture ... shocked a lot of winemakers, because the vineyards are usually transferred from father to son,\" he said.\n\nRelated: This app helps regular folks make sense of wine\n\nTebily was able to expand his acreage when a Cognac producer who was nearing retirement took a liking to the former footballer and agreed to sell his vineyards.\n\n\"He preferred to let an African achieve his dream,\" said Tebily. \"It gave him satisfaction to do the opposite of what everybody expected.\"\n\nThe 22 hectares that Tebily now owns yield roughly 11,000 bottles of Cognac a year. He sells part of the haul to a larger producer, while the rest is sold under his own label, Cognac OT.\n\nThe label has four varieties that sell for between $37 and $305. The cheapest is aged for a minimum of two years, while the premier \"Tres Vieux\" offering matures for over 25 years.\n\nTebily said he hopes his career change will serve as an inspiration to others.\n\n\"I realized that everybody is capable of doing something completely different than they did before,\" he said. \"For an ex-player to do something else is very encouraging, it's very gratifying.\"",

Other marketing projects include Twitter-activated vending machines and artsy skateboarding parties.\n\nEvans attributes much of the firm's success to its eccentric marketing efforts, but the company also relies on a winning local ingredient.\n\nIndigenous to South Africa, BOS organic tea is made from the rooibos (red bush) plant. It's \"quintessentially from South Africa\" said Evans. The company says the tea is rich in antioxidants, a selling point for increasingly health-conscious consumers.\n\nThe company is tapping into a booming global market for premium beverages, including products without alcohol. Over the past decade, traditional carbonated drinks have lost 10% of their market share, according to Evans, and a wave of competing brands such as Britain's Fever Tree have enjoyed rapid growth.\n\nWith flavor combinations ranging from lemon and peach to lime and ginger, BOS sold roughly 10 million units last year. \"We've run at north of 70% compound annual growth rate since 2011,\" said Evans.\n\nThe CEO believes the next big market is the United States, which offers \"tremendous growth opportunities.\" Having only launched in California in December, he expects half of the firm's sales to come from the United States within three years. The tea is being sold in premium natural food retailers.\n\nBOS launched its first international office in Amsterdam in 2014, and it now sells iced tea in 14 countries.\n\nThe company does need to be careful about sourcing its key ingredient. Rooibos plants take three years to generate their first harvest.\n\nBut that hasn't scared away investors. For example, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson purchased a 10% stake in the company.",

I was one of them recently, and after jumping into the uncertain abyss, I came away with the undisputed highlight from a week-long trip to the fabled island -- not to mention newfound respect for the power of the sea.\n\nColloquially known as \"coasteering\" and first invented in nearby Wales, the amphibious activity combines rough sea swimming, intertidal caving, cliff-climbing and leaping from extreme heights into the exposed sea below. Avoiding impact with rocks, hypothermia and drowning is all part of the \"fun.\"\n\nRelated content The 32 most beautiful places to visit in Ireland\n\nSoaring to the sea off Northern Ireland's Atlantic coast. Courtesy The Jungle NI\n\nIn truth, coasteering in Ireland is a lot safer, less extreme and more enjoyable than it sounds. For around $60 per person, local guides will typically fully outfit you with a warming wetsuit, safety helmet, protective gloves, water shoes, a mega life jacket and an exhilarating -- and probably exhausting (in a good way) -- itinerary.\n\nAll told, it's a fantastic way to not only see the country's famous cliffs and shorelines in a new light, but to gain a new appreciation for an often-hostile environment.\n\nFrom County Cork in the southern peninsulas to the cliff coasts of Kerry, Clare and Galway in the middle, and then all the way up to County Donegal and Northern Ireland's timeless Giant's Causeway, nearly two dozen guiding companies provide coasteering tours around much of the island.\n\nAccording to glowing consumer reviews and my own personal experience, here are some of the best locations to cliff-jump off the western edge of Europe.\n\nCounty Antrim\n\nA few miles east of Northern Ireland's spectacular Benone Strand, part of one of the island's longest beaches, you'll find near-ideal coasteering conditions when jumping with Causeway Coasteering in Portrush or Coasteering NI in Ballintoy.\n\nThe world-famous Giant's Causeway is the draw for most tourists traveling this far north, but there's plenty to discover along the whole of the Causeway Coastal Route.\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" fans will recognize Ballintoy Harbour as the filming location for the Iron Islands, and you may need nerves of steel to handle the rush of adrenaline when coasteering on the island's northern edge.\n\nCounty Donegal\n\nOver the border in the Republic of Ireland, if you really want to go out of your way to the most uninhabited and unspoiled areas in all of the island, look no further than County Donegal.\n\nNestled in one of Europe's finest and most untouched coastal landscapes, Wild Atlantic Adventure Centre guides patrons to some of the most impressive jumps among the most outstanding sea stacks in all of Ireland or Britain. Located in the small village of Clonmany, the outfitter provides year-round coasteering tours, but ideal conditions are usually found in spring.\n\nCounty Sligo\n\nRain or shine, coasteering offers an exhilarating adrenaline burst. Courtesy The Jungle NI\n\nPrimarily known for its big-wave surfing, Mullaghmore in County Sligo is both extreme and abundant when it comes to coasteering. According to North West Coasteering , \"there are so many routes here, you could come every week for a year and still do a different tour every time.\"\n\nFor maximum adrenaline from high-jumping cliffs, head to Mullaghmore proper. For more mellow routes with a focus on sea-cave swimming, tours are also available at nearby Bundoran.\n\nCounty Galway\n\nSituated on the northwest corner of County Galway, Connemara is a hotbed for Irish coasteering.\n\nAlthough you can't (nor would you want to) jump the deathly Cliffs of Moher just south of here, Real Adventures Delphi Resort and Clare Island Adventures all offer highly rated trips to the jagged and sometimes tightly quartered coastline of Connemara.\n\nWhen you're finished, consider soaking up the fairytale good looks of nearby Connemara National Park.\n\nNote: To get a better idea of what you'll be jumping from and into, talk to a guide before booking.\n\nRelated content 6 outdoor adventures in Ireland\n\nCounty Kerry\n\nIn the likely event you'll visit the very popular and very scenic County Kerry -- which includes Dingle, Gap of Dunloe and Killarney National Park -- you'd be well-advised to add coasteering to your itinerary while there.\n\nWhile touring with Wild Water Adventures from Tralee, you'll be treated to thrilling versions of the above, not to mention one of the friendliest and most experienced experts along the coast. Like all good coasteering guides, John Edwards never pressured anyone in our group, but was always encouraging, empathetic and reassuring.\n\nWhichever way you go, adventure tourism along the Wild Atlantic Way is burgeoning and bucking the tour-bus trend when it comes to seeing the legendary Irish coast.",

Germany's biggest city would be reunited. For that matter, the entire country would be.\n\nThe ripple wave from this event would eventually reach Moscow, toppling the Soviet Union's empire and ending communist rule in Russia that dated back to World War I.\n\nJoyous Berliners, dismantling that wall with hammers, shovels and even their bare hands, would redefine the world order in one spectacular night.\n\nRelated content Berlin Wall: Get the fast facts\n\nAnd this event would also change the world of travel\n\nIn short order, a whole new region of travel opportunities opened up to Westerners and others around the globe.

Andreas Rentz/Getty Images\n\nDecades later, the few remaining remnants of the Berlin Wall and its footprint are of historical and even recreational interest. Here are a few of the many wall-oriented spots to see in Berlin:\n\nBrandenburg Gate: A good place to start your historical tour is the Brandenburg Gate, the history of which reaches back way beyond the communist era to Napoleon, who took the gate's crowning statue away during his military campaign through Europe in the early 1800s. (France returned it.)\n\nThe gate was the famous backdrop for US President Ronald Reagan's memorable challenge to the Soviets in the 1980s to \"tear down this wall.\" Once the symbol of oppression, it's now the city's symbol of free movement and newfound prosperity. And it makes a great spot for a selfie.\n\nEast Side Gallery: You can see more than 100 large-sized murals painted onto one of the few remaining pieces of the wall left standing. The murals can give visitors a good sense of the joy and hope that swept through Berlin and the rest of Germany at this time.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff looks back 25 years to singing on the Berlin Wall to unite East and West Germany.

Along with the wall, you can see interesting mausoleums dating much further back in time.\n\nBerlin Wall Memorial: This somber site is a memorial to people who died trying to cross into West Berlin and might be the best place to see what the wall looked like at the end of the 1980s and soak in the atmosphere of a city divided.\n\nBerlin Wall Memorial : Bernauer Str. 111, 13355 Berlin, Germany; +49 30 467986666\n\nCheckpoint Charlie: This is name that Westerners gave to what was probably the best-known border crossing between East and West Berlin.

Istanbul's new airport was officially inaugurated Monday -- although it won't be fully functioning til the end of the year.\n\nWhy the rush if it's not quite ready? Well there's symbolic significance: October 29 marks the 95th anniversary of Turkey establishing itself as a republic.\n\nThe swanky new airport aims to establish itself as a major travel hub and a key player on the world aviation stage, thanks to Turkey's East-meets-West location.\n\nOnce completed, the airport will be pretty huge -- the total project area is 76.5 million square meters. It's supposed to have the world's largest terminal under one roof, although it's opening in phases and only limited flights will take off at first.\n\nBut the PR team says the airport is \"built to grow\" and they hope the airport will see 200,000 or more passengers passing through daily.\n\nControversial project\n\nIstanbul's new airport officially opened on October 29 2018.

Courtesy Istanbul New Airport\n\nThe airport's tulip-shaped control tower and striking design won first prize in the \"Future projects -- Infrastructure\" category at the 2016 World Architectural Festival in Berlin.\n\nIstanbul New Airport calls itself a \"green\" airport, thanks to its recycling capabilities and rainwater utilization capacity. However, some environmental groups have hit back -- arguing the airport construction has caused mass deforestation\n\nThe total project area is 76.5 million square meters. Courtesy Istanbul New Airport\n\nThere have also been accusations of poor working conditions and workers dying on site. Turkey's Ministry of Labor has blamed \"health problems and traffic accidents\" for 27 worker fatalities on site, according to reports.\n\nThe total cost of the project is roughly $12 billion. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed the airport's name as being simply \"Istanbul Airport.\"\n\nNew aviation center\n\nThe design won first prize in the \"Future projects -- Infrastructure\" category at the 2016 World Architectural Festival in Berlin. Courtesy Istanbul New Airport\n\nBy the end of December 2018, Turkey's main airport -- Ataturk International Airport -- will cease operations and Istanbul New Airport will become the city's aviation center.\n\nThere has also been widespread construction to connect the airport to the rest of the city -- via metro, road and high-speed train.\n\nThe team hope the airport will become one of the world's busiest within the next few years -- igniting the Turkish economy and generating jobs -- but time will tell whether the new project has a smooth takeoff or gets grounded in further delays.\n\nRelated content 6 of the best hotels in Istanbul\n\nThe significance of Istanbul New Airport\n\nThe team hopes the airport will become one of the world's busiest within the next few years. Courtesy Istanbul New Airport\n\nCNN Travel asked three European aviation experts to weigh in on how Istanbul's new airport might impact the transport world.\n\n'The project is unprecedented'\n\n\"From an airport planning perspective, the project is unprecedented, both in terms of its size (the eventual plan is for the airport to accommodate 200 million passengers, which is nearly double the size of the current largest airport in the world, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) and, in particular, the speed with which the project was attempted.\n\nTo complete an airport project of this size in just three and a half years was extremely challenging, not least in terms of ensuring timely operational readiness of all related facilities, systems, procedures and equipment needed to run the airport (Berlin's Brandenburg Airport provides a stark example of what can go wrong with a new airport project like this).\n\nPolitically, it is important for Turkey, President Erdogan, and his party, opening on the 95th anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish Republic. Building a new airport is inevitably a vastly expensive undertaking (reportedly around $12 billion), and there have been concerns around the coincidence of this with a general downturn in the Turkish economy. There have also been ethical concerns raised about labor practices involving the thousands of workers needed to the complete the project on time.\n\nWhile there will likely be challenges ahead, there are several factors acting in the airports favor, including the relatively strong existing domestic air transport market in Turkey (which rivals in the Middle East generally do not have to the same extent), and the fact that the airport is less likely to face the same degree of potentially constraining environmental legislation, which is generally the case for large airports in Western Europe.\n\nRegardless, the airport will certainly have an impact (one way or another) for air transport both within the region and globally.\" --\n\nDr Thomas Budd, Lecturer in Airport Planning and Management, Centre for Air Transport Management, Cranfield University, UK\n\nRelated content How Asia's airports are changing the way we travel\n\n'Aviation demand in Turkey is growing rapidly'\n\nPlanes on the tarmac at Istanbul Airport on October 29, ahead of the inauguration. Burak Kara/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n\"The new airport is taking over from Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport, which is already in the world's top 20 busiest airports. So effectively it's the same situation as if Atat\u00fcrk (which is a congested airport with sometimes significant delays) was expanded. It's quite unusual to see a large airport expansion in Europe but much more in line with recent significant capacity expansions in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nProjected growth rates in aviation demand between Europe and and the Middle East/Asia are very high (for example Boeing projects demand in 20 years' time between Europe and the Middle East to be 2.6 times what it is at present in terms of passenger-km, and 3 times for trips from Europe to China). So the new airport is trying to act as a hub for some of that traffic as well as serving increases in demand to and from Turkey (the Turkish aviation system has grown rapidly in recent years). In doing so it's competing with other large hub airports in the Middle East and Europe for long-distance passengers.\n\nIn the short term the main impact will be smaller delays for passengers traveling to, from and via Istanbul and greater flexibility for airlines using the airport, which may in turn mean some increases in overall passenger demand. Longer term, the outcome is more difficult to predict. But capacity expansion is typically constrained in European airports and much less so for Middle Eastern airports, so we might see some European airport transfer passenger traffic switch to Istanbul.\n\nAs to whether the airport will become one of the world's busiest: given that it is taking over all of the traffic from an existing airport that is already one of the world's busiest, this seems very likely. Aviation demand in Turkey is growing rapidly and long-distance passenger demand which could use Istanbul as a transfer airport is also growing rapidly. So I would be very surprised if it was not (barring war, civil unrest, etc.).\"\n\nDr Lynnette Dray, Senior Research Associate, Bartlett School Env, Energy & Resources, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College, London\n\n'It will directly compete with the current hub airports in the Middle East'\n\nThe terminal of the new Istanbul Airport, with a banner featuring Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Burak Kara/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n\"I think that the primary thought behind the new airport is that it will directly compete with the current hub airports in the Middle East such as in Doha and Dubai. I think it's got a very, very good chance of taking market share off them when it comes to single-stop itineraries that go from Asia to Europe and Europe to Asia. But also I think Istanbul is generally better situated. It can also act as a hub to some parts of Africa and indeed the current airport that's there, Atat\u00fcrk, already does.\n\nSo direct flight is increasingly popular and of course a hub airport would have to compete with long-distance direct flights. So I think that might be an issue. And also the fact that this airport's being relocated about 50 kilometers north of the city or north of the current airport means that, I would suspect, there might be a slightly subdued demand for flights to and from Istanbul itself. And also there might be competition from the other airport in Istanbul, Sabiha Gokcen, which is going to end up being slightly closer to the population centers.\n\nI can't see it struggling for passengers, given that the current airport that it's replacing has something like 63 million a year and I'd imagine most of those will transfer to the new airport. So that's already a substantial number of passengers that it's kind of inheriting off the back of the reputation of the previous airport. I would imagine that -- should they operationally run smoothly, so in other words should they have low connecting time, should they implement decent transport connections to the center of Istanbul -- then I can't see why they couldn't hit some of their targets pretty quickly.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Passengers concerned about the impact of air travel on the environment could soon opt for a cleaner alternative.\n\nEasyJet, the British-based budget airline, has pledged to develop a fleet of electric planes to cover short-haul routes by 2030, which would effectively reduce carbon emissions and noise from its operations.\n\nThe no-frills carrier is in partnership with US-based manufacturer Wright Electric to build battery-propelled jets for flights of less than two hours.\n\nFounded in 2016, Wright Electric already has a two-seater electric plane and plans to begin flying a nine-seater next year. It has now applied for a patent on a motor for an electric airliner.\n\nElectric 'flyways'\n\nIf successful, such an aircraft could be used on popular routes -- or electric \"flyways,\" as easyJet refers to them -- such as London to Amsterdam.\n\nThe technological advancement is \"moving fast,\" according to the airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren.\n\nSpeaking from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, he said: \"From the two-seater aircraft, which is already flying, to the nine-seater, which will fly next year, electric flying is becoming a reality and we can now foresee a future that is not exclusively dependent on jet fuel.\n\n\"The target range of the electric plane is around 500 kilometers, which, within our current route portfolio, would mean a route like Amsterdam to London could become the first electric 'flyway.'\"\n\nQuieter and cheaper\n\nWright Electric predicts electric planes will be up to 50% quieter and 10% cheaper than traditional aircraft for airlines to buy and operate.\n\nCEO Jeffrey Engler said: \"We are excited about what the next year holds. EasyJet has been a fantastic partner and we look forward to helping introduce low-emissions, low-noise aviation, to Europe.\n\nRelated content 7 electric aircraft you could be flying in soon\n\nGiven the continuing rise in the price of jet fuel, many airlines would welcome a way to cut emissions, noise and travel costs.\n\nAs such, several high-profile engineering companies are also working on electric aircraft. Zunum, backed by Boeing, will use an engine turbine from France's Safran to power an electric motor for a hybrid plane, while Siemens has been working on developing electric motors for aircraft in collaboration with Airbus.",

Other Silk Road merchants brought news of the flames as they would trave l to other lands.\n\nIt's why the country earned the moniker the \"land of fire.\"\n\nRelated content The mud volcano capital of the world\n\nAncient religion\n\nSuch fires were once plentiful in Azerbaijan, but because they led to a reduction of gas pressure underground, interfering with commercial gas extraction, most have been snuffed out.\n\nYanar Dag is one of the few remaining examples, and perhaps the most impressive.\n\nAt one time they played a key role in the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which was founded in Iran and flourished in Azerbaijan in the first millennium BCE.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nFor Zoroastrians, fire is a link between humans and the supernatural world, and a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom can be gained. It's purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship.\n\nToday, most visitors who arrive at the no-frills Yanar Dag visitors' center come for the spectacle rather than religious fulfillment.\n\nThe experience is most impressive at night, or in winter. When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila.\n\nDespite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it's a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it. The center offers only a small cafe and there's not much else in the area.\n\nRelated content Naftalan: The Azerbaijan resort where guests bathe in crude oil\n\nAteshgah Fire Temple\n\nFor a deeper insight into Azerbaijan's history of fire worship, visitors should head east of Baku to Ateshgah Fire Temple.\n\n\"Since ancient times, they think that [their] god is here,\" says our guide, as we enter the pentagonal complex which was built in the 17th and 18th century by Indian settlers in Baku.\n\nFire rituals at this site date back to the 10th century or earlier. The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for \"home of fire\" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent.\n\nA natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors.\n\nThe temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.\n\nMerchants and ascetics\n\nBuilt like a caravanserai-style travelers' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms.\n\nThese were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end.\n\nThe temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold.",

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.\n\n(CNN) \u2014 A place for cleansing and contemplation, for relaxation and conversation.\n\nAzerbaijan 's old hammam culture may have waned in recent years, but many of the city's older residents recall with nostalgia the weekly ritual of visiting the city's public baths.\n\nIn the days of the shahs, the khans and even the Russian Empire, hammams in Azerbaijan were about much more than just getting clean.\n\n\"People got together, chatted, discussed. It was a social institution where you would relax and, everything that had built up inside of you, you'd talk about it and share it,\" says Kamil Ibragimov, head of the archaeological department in Baku's Old City administration.\n\nSpiritual and physical needs\n\nAzerbaijani cities in the Middle Ages were separated into small neighborhoods known as mehelle and each one had its own hammam and mosque, catering to both the spiritual and physical needs of local Muslims.\n\nThe hammam also played a key role in marriage. Long before the Soviets did away with religious conservatism, women's hammams were a natural hunting ground for mothers eager to get a closer look at potential young brides. Men on the other hand used the hammam to strike deals over tea and games of nard, the local version of backgammon.\n\nAzerbaijan's hammams are strictly single sex. Tom Marsden\n\nAbove all, though, hammams were historically a means of maintaining public hygiene.\n\nIn the days of the Silk Road, for example, a hammam stood at both entrances to Baku's Old City and travelers could only enter after burning their old clothes and having a good scrub.\n\nHammam culture dipped a little in Soviet times as apartments were increasingly fitted with their own baths and showers, but hammams were still the first port of call whenever there was a water crisis.\n\nToday there's still a loyal crowd of locals that can't live without a hammam, but before joining them here's a brief guide to its rules and rituals.\n\nHow to hammam\n\n1. Male or female: Hamams in Azerbaijan are strictly segregated: Some are just for men, some for women and some for both but on different days. While this segregation rule has relaxed a little since the Middle Ages -- some male hammams now employ masseuses -- mixed bathing is still a complete no-no.\n\n2. Wear a towel: As opposed to Russian \"banyas\" and Finnish saunas and despite the segregation rule, strutting around completely naked is not allowed. Instead a special towel called a fite must be worn at all times.\n\n3. Be whipped: Given the former Russian influence over the Caucasus it's no surprise that bushy and aromatic birch twigs have also found their way into the Azerbaijani hammam.\n\nBeing lightly whipped by a companion in the parkhana, or steam room, stirs up the heat and aids breathing and circulation.\n\nRelated content The mud volcano capital of the world\n\n4. Scrub hard: Central to the Azerbaijani hamam ritual is kise, in which a person called a kisechi scrubs all the grime from your body using a large abrasive glove. It may feel a little forceful at first, but will leave a light tingle across the body.\n\n5. Steam room etiquette: A felt hat should also be worn to insulate you (and your hair) and prevent overheating. Scrubbing in the steam room is strictly prohibited.\n\n6. Foamy soap: Another interesting ritual is something called kurpuk. Soap and water are whisked together with a special net to create big clouds of soapy foam which the kisechi rubs over every inch of your body.\n\n7. Coffee, salt and honey: Another procedure is rubbing salt, coffee and honey into the skin. The salt helps you sweat, the coffee is aromatic and the honey soothes any wounds and inflammations.\n\n8. Take your time: The bathing process itself shouldn't be rushed, but equally important is drinking tea afterward. There's no time limit on how long you can spend at the hammam so it's not unusual to sit, scrub and socialize over six to eight hours.\n\n9. Admire the architecture: Azerbaijan's old hammams were built in the Eastern style common across Iran, Central Asia and the Middle East. A key feature is the cupola with holes at the top, superbly engineered to let air out but not let rainwater in. Older hammams were often built half-underground, keeping them warm in winter and cool in summer.\n\nMost of Azerbaijan's old hammams stopped functioning a long time ago. Some are preserved as monuments while others have been converted into shops, bazaars or tea houses. But there are still a few places in central Baku to experience the steamy rituals of the past.\n\nAgha Mikayil Hamami\n\nMen and women are both welcome at Baku's oldest hammam. Tom Marsden\n\nThis is the number one choice for a quintessential Azerbaijani hammam experience. Built in the 18th century, Agha Mikayil is Baku's oldest functioning hammam. It operates separate days for men and women and is run by an enthusiastic team with lots of experience.\n\n\"I'm like an amphibian,\" longtime manager Orkhan Gasimov tells CNN Travel . \"I can't live without a hamam.\"\n\nGiven its timeless appeal, Agha Mikayil has been used several times as a film location. A hammam scene from the 1956 film \"If Not This One, Then That One\" is especially popular.\n\nWomen's days are Mondays and Fridays, all the rest are for men. Basic entrance is just 10 manats (around $6), including limitless access to the steam room, showers and pool. Extra services cost as follows: body scrub -- 10 manats; coffee, salt and honey treatment -- 20 manats; massage -- 20 manats.\n\nAgha Mikayil Hamami, 16, Kickik Qala, Icheri Sheher, Baku; +994-50-345-21-44\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami caters to a local crowd. Tom Marsden\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami (also known as Prestige) dates back to Baku's late 19th-century oil boom. This was originally a men's hammam, switched to being women-only during the Soviet era, and is now once again exclusively for men.\n\nToday this hammam has a local clientele, offers all the traditional treatments and still breathes the spirit of the past.\n\nPrices: entrance (including steam room and baths) -- 12 manats; 30-minute massage -- 15 manats; the full package costs about 60 manats ($35).\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami, 5 Saftar Quliyev Street, Icheri Sheher, Baku; +994-55-639-19-99 // +994-55-434-65-35\n\nShe-Bi Hamami\n\nElegant detailing at She-Bi Hamami. Tom Marsden\n\nThis 19th-century hammam -- known until recently as Gasim Bey Hammam, after its millionaire founder Gasim Bey -- was exclusively for women for most of its existence.\n\nIt's now a men-only hammam and is especially popular with civil servants, thanks to its location near four government ministries.\n\nThe main attractions are its elegant central pool and a locals-only feel. It offers all the usual procedures (steam room, whipping, pool, scrub, mochalka -- a smoothing wash with soap -- and massage), plus there's an in-house barber, caf\u00e9 and a booth for pedicures.\n\nPrices are 12 manats for entrance (includes unlimited time in the steam room and pool); 12 manats for scrubbing, 20 manats for an hour-long massage.\n\nShe-Bi Hamami, 41 Murtuza Mukhtarov Street, Baku; +994-50-540-08-41\n\nAkhund Hammam\n\nThere's no time limit at hammams, so relax as long as you like. Tom Marsden\n\nFurther along Murtuza Mukhtarov Street is a great example of the age-old link between mosques and hammams. Almost opposite the green-domed Haji Sultan Ali mosque is the men-only Akhund Hammam, named in honor of the akhund (cleric) that lobbied for its construction way back in 1887.\n\nPrices: entrance and use of the sauna -- 10 manats; a 30-minute scrub -- 12 manats; and a 30-minute massage -- 14 manats.\n\nAkhund Hammam, 141 Murtuza Mukhtarov Street; +994-12-595-50-59\n\nRelated content Azerbaijan: What to see and do in the Land of Fire\n\nTezebay Hammam\n\nFor Tom Marsden's story about Azerbaijan hammams (CNN Travel sponsorship: Destination Azerbaijan) Tom Marsden\n\nThis hammam's building may date back to 1886, but it's only been functioning as a hammam for the last 20 years. The eclectic mix of souvenirs, stuffed animals and dim lighting create a wacky ambiance and make the place feel part hammam, part museum. Look out for the portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the small statue of Donald Trump.\n\nWhile less historic, its services and equipment are a little more upmarket. This is reflected in the prices - 23 manats covers entrance while the average all-inclusive package is 86 manats. This includes Russian, Turkish and Finnish saunas, pool and baths, body scrub, a half-hour massage and veniki (birch-twig whipping).\n\nTezebay is especially popular with stag and hen parties. Men's and women's hammams are housed in adjacent buildings.\n\nTezebay Hammam , 30 Sheikh Shamil Street, Baku; +994-12-492-64-40",

But it's Azerbaijan , the mud volcano capital of the world.\n\nOil-rich region\n\nThere are more than 400 volcanoes in this oil-rich country balanced between Europe and Asia, with more being discovered all the time.\n\nTen years ago, a 12,000-hectare State Nature Reserve was founded on the Absheron Peninsula near the capital Baku.\n\nIn July 2018, scientists from Azerbaijan's Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources took CNN Travel on an off-road tour.\n\nClattering up the precipitous slopes in an off-road vehicle is like a firmer version of the dune-bashing safaris popular next door in the Middle East. But the most thrilling sights are still to come.\n\nWe start our tour beside the mouth of Deveboynu volcano, or \"Neck of the Camel.\" The land around is parched, but inside the crater, a muddy slurry -- called mud breccia -- is bubbling gently.\n\nThe hills may look peaceful, but below this humped, reptilian landscape, the Earth is breathing and turning like a slumbering beast.\n\nRelated content Azerbaijan: What to see and do in the Land of Fire\n\nl e v a r t\n\nWhere tectonic plates collide\n\nMud volcanoes are usually found in subduction zones -- the parts of the globe where tectonic plates collide, sometimes causing earthquakes, tsunamis and violent eruptions.\n\nPockets of subterranean gas force their way to the surface, belching out methane and a muddy mix of water and oil.\n\nMud volcanoes never grow to the size of regular volcanoes. Most are small, ever-changing landforms, often accompanied by peculiar sculptures formed by the spewed out clumps of clay.\n\nThese whimsical shapes, says Jeyhun Pashayev, director of the reserve, are \"like a picture made by a child.\"\n\nStrange beauty\n\n\"When there are mud volcanoes, it means there are carbohydrogen resources in the deep,\" explains Pashayev. \"As you see, there are lot of mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan which means there are a lot of oil resources.\"\n\nThe arid lands of the Absheron Peninsula might not be as fresh and lush as the mountainous north, but they have their own strange beauty.\n\nThis is the region richest in natural resources: both for oil and for the mud breccia, which is used in the chemical and construction industries.\n\n\"About 20 of the 50 minerals used in cement\" are to be found in the volcanic mud, says Pashayev -- which meant that before the reserve was signed into existence, people regularly stole mud from the site for home building projects.\n\nAs we set out on the road again to our next volcanic field, Pashayev gestures towards a huge factory on the horizon, with a large hill of mud to its side. \"This, Garadagh, is the richest part of Baku. Around 90% of the stones are being produced here for building the houses. Depending on the quality, it costs from 50 cents to 3 manats ($1.77) per stone.\"\n\nPashayev and his team hand-make signs to warn off trespassers on the reserve. Maureen O'Hare/CNN\n\nMud-bathing\n\nUnlike regular volcanoes, there's no magma or lava, so the liquid mud isn't hot -- instead it usually keeps to a temperate 22/23 C (72 F).\n\nThat balminess means that some mud volcanoes are suitable for bathing.\n\nVolcanic clay is sometimes used in the treatment of skin conditions, as well as rheumatism and diseases related to the nervous system.\n\nPashayev explains that during the Soviet era, the volcanic mud was sometimes used to create casts to treat broken bones.\n\n\"Also, you can get super results using the mud volcanoes for the skin,\" he claims. \"You can use [the mud] and get good results, even if you have scars. If the cosmetology doctor can't disappear the scars, mud volcanoes can do this!\"\n\nRadioactivity\n\nHowever, not every gray puddle is skin-friendly.\n\n\"Because it comes from deep,\" says Pashayev, some volcanoes \"come with radioactive material. It's not a joke.\"\n\nPashayev's team monitors the levels of radioactivity regularly, with safety certification being awarded on an annual basis.\n\nThe subterranean world has fascinated people around the globe for millennia, and the strange, violent and seemingly inexplicable behavior of mud volcanoes has long captivated the Azerbaijani people.\n\nThe country is known as the Land of Fire -- while Baku is the City of Winds -- and some of the gas leaks in this oil-rich region are constantly on fire, such as at the perpetually burning mountainside of Yanar Dag.\n\nIt's believed that the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which centers on fire worship, was closely connected to this phenomena.\n\nIn 2001, Lokbutan volcano some 15 kilometers from Baku erupted, sending flames close to 50 feet in the air.\n\nRelated content Naftalan: The Azerbaijan resort where guests bathe in crude oil\n\n'A mystic thing'\n\nThe ever-bubbling cauldron of Pilpili Gardag. Maureen O'Hare/CNN\n\n\"Mud volcanoes are a mystic thing,\" says Pashayev. Some years ago, a Danish sound archivist came to the reserve \"with a huge device like a piano\" to record the sounds from within the volcano.\n\nWhat Pashayev heard shocked him. \"I swear, I thought that this is Hell. I heard human noises -- really. Imagine thousands of people, crying 'help us!' from the deep.\"\n\nWith a similarly evocative turn of phrase, Pashayev also compares the wind sighing through a mud sculpture to the sound made \"when you cut the head off a cow\" -- a common sight on the backstreets of Baku until butchery regulations were changed earlier this year.\n\nAnd if the Azerbaijani landscape seems otherworldly, that could be because conditions here aren't dissimilar to Mars.\n\nA number of possible mud volcanoes have been found on Mars , suggesting the presence -- at one time -- of water, and therefore the possibility of life.\n\n'Millions of snakes'\n\n\"There are six types of mud volcano,\" explains Pashayev. \"Active. Not active. Oil-producing. Underwater. Island mud volcano. And destroyed mud volcano.\"\n\nThere are around 140 underwater mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan and there are six island volcanoes under the reserve's jurisdiction -- although explains scientist Anar Baghiriv, the team lacks the resources to visit them.\n\nBut on one of the island volcanoes, Pashayev explains, the strangest sight isn't the bubbling mud. \"From 100 meters, you see that the island is shaking. But when you go close, you see millions of snakes, can you imagine? Millions.\"\n\nSo covered is the island with sea snakes, adds Baghiriv, \"You cannot find a place to put your foot.\"\n\nWhat lies beneath\n\nPilpili Gardag is the last stop on our tour. Once we're ushered past the security guard, it's a steep walk uphill to the most dramatic volcano yet.\n\nThe slick surface of the mud glistens in the searing July sunshine, with huge gray bubbles forming and then bursting with a satisfying plup.\n\nMud volcano eruptions vary enormously, from those that quietly, continuously pour out slow streams of slurry, to explosive eruptions that expel thousands of cubic meters at once.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, says Pashayev, we have \"different sizes, different views, different sculptures. We have all the types, all the forms.\"\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records lists the world's largest mud volcano as being an Azerbaijani one, measuring one kilometer across the base and several hundred kilometers in height.\n\nAt Pilipili Gardag, the volatile lunar landscape, with the sun bouncing white off the bleached-out clay and the summer heat sliding towards 40 C (104 F), has an uncanny majesty.\n\nBut the real mysteries, the churning, living wonders, are in the many shifting layers beneath our feet.",

When you travel , you want more.\n\nFrom Mexico to Malta and northern lights to sunny skies, these 15 destinations celebrate Christmas better than the rest:\n\n1. Malta\n\nVisiting presepju, or nativity scenes, is an integral part of Christmas in Malta. Every year, residents proudly open their shutters, and sometimes even their garage doors, to display their holy crib confections to the public.\n\nOn a grander scale, the Bethlehem f'Ghajnsielem is a life-size nativity spread over 20,0000 square meters of formerly abandoned fields.\n\nInhabited and animated by more than 150 actors, including entire families, the village takes visitors back in time to Judea of 2,000 years ago, complete with oil lamps, turn mills, grazing animals, crafts areas teaching traditional skills and folklore, a tavern and, of course, a grotto housing baby Jesus.\n\nDowntown Valletta is also home to a lively Christmas spirit, with carolers singing outside the Baroque St. John's Co-Cathedral during Advent, and a dizzying display of Christmas lights on Republic Street.\n\nThe Manoel Theater is well known for its annual Christmas pantomime. (Old Theatre Street, Il-Belt Valletta, Malta; +356 2124 6389)\n\nA visit to the privately owned Malta Toy Museum , featuring dolls, soldiers, train sets, and clockwork tin trinkets dating as far back as the 1790s, is a heartwarming homage to childhood. (222 Republic St, Valletta, Malta; +356 2125 1652)\n\n2. New York\n\nRockefeller Center lies at the core of the New York Christmas. Its famed ice rink has been around for 80 years; the decorated tree has been a holiday tradition since 1931. (45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10111)\n\nAcross the street, Radio City hosts the annual Christmas Spectacular , starring the Rockettes. (1260 6th Ave, New York, NY 10020)\n\nOn the southwest corner of Central Park, Columbus Circle hosts more than 100 vendors selling clothes, gifts, snacks and drinks at the Holiday Market. (Columbus Circle, 59th Street and Central Park West)\n\nFashion's biggest names join in the festivities, setting up impressive Christmas window displays. The most glamorous cases are at the Fifth Avenue flagships and department stores such as Saks and Bergdorf.\n\n3. Bath, England\n\nPlunge into Christmas in Bath, England. Bath Tourism\n\nThere are few cities in the world where you can celebrate the birth of Jesus and the birth of Jane Austen with the same amount of fanfare, but Bath, England, happens to be one of them.\n\nThe Jane Austen Centre -- and on-site Regency Tearoom -- is the best place to learn about the city's most famous resident.

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Henry Worsley is in the middle of nowhere. At every direction there is merely glistening whiteness, low glaring sun as far as the eye can see, reflecting off the blinding white snow.\n\nIn the frozen landscape at his feet, he carves out a haunting phrase: \"I am the Antarctic.\"\n\nHe snaps a photograph of the scene.\n\nNow this evocative image forms one of the most memorable photographs in David Grann 's new book \" The White Darkness \" -- a thrilling work of nonfiction charting the polar expeditions of a latter-day British explorer, Henry Worsley, and the adventures of his predecessor -- and idol -- Ernest Shackleton, in the early 1900s.\n\n\"All you see in this image is nothing but this white, icy scape and then this strange graffiti that he had written,\" says Grann, who is a staff writer at The New Yorker and author of acclaimed book \"The Lost City of Z.\"\n\n\"The White Darkness\" is published by Doubleday -- a division of Penguin Random House -- but started life as an enthralling long-read in The New Yorker in February 2018. Its title is taken from one of Worsley's audio dispatches:\n\n\"Anyway, I'm back on track and now happy I can part a straight line, even through another day of the white darkness.\"\n\nExplorer Henry Worsley carved this chilling message into the Antarctic while trekking the polar region, alone. Courtesy Lou Rudd\n\nBoth Worsley and Shackleton's stories, interwoven by Grann in his book, are tales of endurance, questioning the meaning of heroism and why some of us are driven to push ourselves to the extreme.\n\n\"I think there is always kind of a mystery at the heart of what drives humans to test themselves,\" says Grann. \"They can never be easily or in any kind of simple psychological way explained.\"\n\nIf Worsley and Shackleton are Grann's heroes, the Antarctic is the enigmatic anti-hero, the brutal-but-beautiful, not-quite-villain who has an irrevocable hold over both men.\n\n\"I think one of the great challenges was not just understanding Henry but was also trying to understand that environment [...] . Antarctica is really a place unto itself. It's more like contemplating Mars than it is contemplating a part of Earth,\" says Grann.\n\nEndurance\n\nErnest Shackleton's story began on South Georgia Island, a glacier-covered island about eleven hundred miles eastwards of Cape Horn, Chile, which Shackleton called \"the Gateway to the Antarctic.\" Courtesy Royal Geographical Society\n\nShackleton is best remembered for two of history's most successful failures.\n\nIn 1907, aged just 33, he led an expedition to Antarctica with three other men -- determined to reach the South Pole.\n\nBy late 1908, only 97 nautical miles from the Pole, he calculated that it wasn't safe to continue and his men turned around. At the time, it was still the southernmost point reached by humans.\n\nFlash forward to 1914 and Shackleton had a new goal -- to complete the first land crossing of Antarctica. But not long after setting out on this odyssey, a band of fellow explorers in tow, Shackleton's ship \"Endurance\" became encased in ice. Over an unforgiving, testing icy winter, the Endurance was slowly crushed and sunk into the freezing waters below.\n\nIncredibly, Shackleton's leadership ensured his entire crew survived in brutal conditions throughout the testing months that followed. In \"The White Darkness\" Grann writes that Shackleton \"almost insisted\" that they remain cheerful.\n\nExpedition photographer Frank Hurley documented the incredible trek through the brutal, but beautiful, landscape. Courtesy Royal Geographical Society\n\nAfter the ship was lost, Shackleton and his crew dragged the salvaged lifeboats across the ice, surviving for 17 months in pop-up camps in crazy conditions.\n\n\"He always rescued his people from certain death and he emerged as one of history's greatest leaders,\" Grann says.\n\nNow Shackleton's the subject of self-help books and business manuals, inspiring everyone from astronauts to Wall Street brokers. But in Shackleton's own lifetime, his exploits were soon eclipsed by more successful polar expeditions.\n\nThat's because our definition of heroism, Grann says, changes with the era.\n\n\"I do think heroes are in many ways a reflection of our times, because they reflect who society chooses to elevate among so many people who are doing various deeds,\" the writer muses.\n\nRelated content On the hunt for the lost city of Z\n\nFollowing in Shackleton's footsteps\n\nHenry Worsley, pictured, was a British army veteran inspired to follow in Shackleton's footsteps. Courtesy Sebastian Copeland\n\nShackleton's leadership, his ability to inspire loyalty and morale and his Antarctic quests made him a natural icon for adventurous British Army veteran Henry Worsley.\n\nWorsley pored over Antarctic books as a boy, thrilled to discover he was a distant relative of one of Shackleton's crew members. No one who knew him was surprised when he decided, in 2008, to embark on a centenary Antarctic South Pole expedition with Will Gow, a descendent of Shackleton and Henry Adams, the great-grandson of another crew-member.\n\nThis atmospheric photo was taken on Worsley, Gow and Adams' centenary expedition. Courtesy William Gow\n\n\"Henry wasn't a religious person, but I think he always felt this deep spirituality about the Antarctic -- and of course he liked the idea that he would be in a place that had been untrodden,\" says Grann.\n\nWorsley, Gow and Adams were pushed to extremes in their Antarctic trek, exposed to impossibilities they couldn't have fathomed before they arrived in the ice blue, empty far South landscape.\n\nBut Worsley, inspired by Shackleton and driven by his own thirst for adventure and exploration, helped his men remain committed to their goal.\n\n\"He was an officer and he served tours with the SAS and he was always repeating this -- their motto: \"A little further a little further.\" And he always repeated the line from Shackleton's family motto: \"By endurance we conquer,\" says Grann.\n\nIncredible images\n\nAfter they lose the Endurance, Shackleton's crew dragged lifeboats across the ice. Courtesy Getty\n\nWhen Shackleton's ship, Endurance, became enveloped by the Antarctic's deadly ice, his expedition photographer Frank Hurley continued to document events that followed. He salvaged the camera equipment and trekked through the Antarctic with it in tow.\n\nHis resulting photographs are cinematic in their scope -- especially those of the imposing, iconic ship, forever to remain in the frost. Then there's the men exploring the ethereal dreamscape of the Antarctic. Lit by flares, the images take on a striking effect, chilling and captivating all at once.\n\nOn Worsley's 2008 expedition, his colleague Gow took his own vibrant photographs of the impossible landscape. Worsley, too, documented his adventures with photography.\n\n\"These photos are just really quite remarkable and they get to some of the things that we've talked about -- which are just trying to wrap your mind around this landscape, trying to wrap your mind around these people setting off in this immense landscape,\" says Grann.\n\nSastrugi is the term for these hard ridges on the snow and ice, sculpted by strong winds. Courtesy Joanna Worsley\n\nRelated content Life on the ice edge: The shifting world of Antarctica\n\nThere are pictures of the sastrugi, the hard ridges on the snow and ice, sculpted by strong winds and almost impossible to circumvent. In many images, the outlook is almost a total white-out, with the red of the tent the only color visible.\n\nWhen, in 2008, Worsley and his fellow explorers reached 88\u00b023'S, the southernmost point reached by their forebears 100 years previously, they recreated the iconic image of Shackleton and his team, wrapped in furs, Union Jack flag blowing in the wind.\n\nThe iconic image of Shackleton and his team in 1908 at 88\u00b023'S.\n\nBut, as Grann notes, reaching this famous point was by definition anticlimactic.\n\n\"They get to this spot that has kind of fueled their dreams and almost lured them to their demise and they look around and there is nothing there, but barren windswept ice. This place, their grail, was really no more than a geographical data point,\" he says.\n\nWorsley and his crew recreated the famous image. Courtesy William Gow\n\nAdams, one of Worsley's companions, \"What is Antarctica other than a blank canvas on which you seek to impose yourself?\n\nThis quote stuck with Grann -- it seemed to get to the heart of polar exploration.\n\n\"The discovery is not a scientific breakthrough or or some ancient civilization or ruins, it is this geographical data point in the middle of empty barren ice,\" he says.\n\nPolar explorers past and present seem to be driven by an internal desire to succeed, to push further, to achieve a feat that forever seems just out of reach.\n\nThe return\n\nWorsley decided to attempt his own solo trek across the Antarctic, unaided. Courtesy William Gow\n\nWorsley returned to Antarctica in 2011, leading a six-strong team retracing Roald Amundsen's journey to the South Pole.\n\nBut even when he was back with his close-knit family -- his wife Joanna and children Alicia and Max -- he still found himself dreaming of the Antarctic wilderness.\n\nWorsley's family are very much at the heart of the story Grann has woven in \"The White Darkness.\"\n\n\"One of the things that really drew me to the story was this remarkable love story at the heart of it between Henry and his wife Joanna,\" says Grann.\n\nHe wanted to achieve a never-before-attained feat. Courtesy William Gow\n\nJoanna, Alicia and Max gave Grann access to Worsley's photographs and diary entries, and spoke to Grann about Worlsey's experiences -- and their own.\n\nHenry's only \"mistress\", Joanna used to joke, was Antarctica.\n\n\"I think everybody is different,\" says Grann. \"I think some people make a journey like that and they do get it out of their system. But for Henry, Antarctica has been inside him since he was young.\"\n\nWorsley was raising money for the Endeavour Fund, a charity that helps wounded army veterans in the UK. Courtesy Joanna Worsley\n\n\"It kind of consumed his imagination, he'd become a leading authority on the Golden Age of Antarctic Exploration and on Shackleton.\"\n\nGrann's story depicts the duality of a man who was deeply committed to his family, but also had this urge to challenge himself, to push himself to endurance and extremes:\n\n\"This man who was [...] a very devoted father and family man and yet had this other obsession that drew him to the most treacherous place, a place that could take life at any moment,\" says Gann.\n\nRelated content The most remote places on Earth\n\nNext step\n\nWorsley sent regular updates back home and wrote about his experiences in his diary. Courtesy William Gow\n\nBack in the UK, Worsley began planning his next feat of endurance -- the first solo trek, unaided, across the Antarctic.\n\n\"He was always setting the compass farther and of course in his final expedition, where he sets out to walk across Antarctica alone and unsupported and unaided was something that nobody had ever dared to do,\" says Grann.\n\nIn \"The White Darkness\", Grann constructs both Worsley and Shackleton's stories like thrillers, edge-of-your-seat tales about finding the unconquerable, flirting constantly with living and dying, the juxtaposition between the \"real\" world and the one of their ambitions.\n\nThe Weddell Sea, home to Berkner Island, pictured here, is where Worsley began his solitary journey.\n\n\"I tried to tell the story from the perspective of people who are going on adventures and they don't know what's going to happen at any moment and death always lurks with every step,\" says Grann. \"So I think in telling it from that perspective it hopefully lets the reader feel both the enormous excitement and the momentary terrors that the people on these expeditions are feeling.\"\n\nIn Grann's book, when Worsley begins his solo trek, the reader feels a sense of foreboding. The explorer was back in this challenging place, alone.\n\nThe picture to the left depicts a man being pulled from a crevasse during explorer Robert Falcon Scott's first Antarctic expedition. On the right, a crevasse is dodged by Worsley's group on the 2008 expedition.\n\nGrann writes how Worsley sent daily audio broadcasts back home and wrote about the treacherous experiences in his diary. Worsley was constantly testing his abilities as a leader, but in his final journey he had what Grann calls \"the most difficult challenge\" -- commanding himself.\n\nBut he was determined to complete his challenging task. In crossing Antarctica unaided, he would raise money for the Endeavour Fund, a charity that helps wounded army veterans in the UK. Britain was behind him -- including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. He was heralded as a hero, a Shackleton for the 21st century.\n\nBut what does it really mean, to be a Shackleton?\n\nOn his final journey, Worsley had what Gann calls \"the most difficult challenge\" -- commanding himself. Courtesy Getty\n\n\"I think to some degree there is a misunderstanding of what made Shackleton great and I think in our societies, we tend to want to always think we could conquer by endurance -- there's this idea that somehow anything can be triumphed and I think people gravitate to Shackleton because of that,\" says Grann.\n\n\"But I think one of the central lessons of Shackleton -- I think one of the central lessons that Worsley grappled with on his last expedition -- is really failure and the fact that we can't conquer everything and the fact that we have human limitations. And I think that's a more profound and difficult lesson to accept.\"\n\nRelated content The most extreme adventures on Earth\n\nHopeful future\n\nWorsley's wife Joanna and children Max and Alicia made a pilgrimage to South Georgia Island in 2017. Courtesy Joanna Worsley\n\nTragically, Worsley's solo trip was his last. He fell victim to a serious infection after being rescued just 30 miles from his goal.\n\nBut his story isn't one lacking in hope. His life continues to inspire; his friend Louis Rudd is about to begin his own solo expedition to honor his friend. Other explorers are also planning their own crossings -- American explorer Colin O'Brady just started his own odyssey across Antarctica.\n\nMeanwhile, Worsley's wife and children visited South Georgia Island in 2017 on a pilgrimage commemorating Worsley. His life and adventures have now been immortalized in Grann's book.\n\nThere are also plans, Grann confirms, to bring Worsley's adventures to the big screen in the form of a movie. The story has been optioned by Imperative Entertainment, the company currently working on an adaptation of one of Grann's other books \" Killers of the Flower Moon: An American Crime and the Birth of the FBI.\"\n\n\"Henry's family is really quite remarkable,\" says Grann.",

Or as England coach Eddie Jones put it in the build up, \"We want to direct the movie, not just be in it.\"\n\nFor 60 minutes, England was in the directors' chair courtesy of tries from Chris Ashton and Dylan Hartley, and but for a disallowed try at the end may well have pulled it off.\n\nBut part of the All Blacks' magic is poise and patience, and the double world champions hit back to escape with a 16-15 victory under the drizzle of southwest London.\n\nWith the World Cup less than a year away it was a significant result for both sides.\n\nFor New Zealand, it added to its reputation as one of sport's most dominant winning machines, and was, perhaps, proof that the recent defeat against South Africa was a blip.\n\nFor England, shorn of a raft of key players through injury, it was another step in the right direction following last week's win against South Africa in the wake of a disappointing year that has put Australia's Jones on the ropes.\n\n\"Sometimes the game loves you, sometimes it doesn't,\" said Jones, whose side got away with a controversial late decision which could have cost them the win against the Springboks.\n\n\"We really stuck it to them. It's a really good step forward because you benchmark yourself against New Zealand.\"\n\nThe All Blacks hadn't been to the home of English rugby for four years, but like the opening chords of a long-awaited Rolling Stones tour, the hair-raising haka told you they were back.\n\nNot that you could hear the warrior's chants, such was the deafening rendition of \"Swing low, sweet chariot,\" English rugby's anthem. The thunderous noise at Twickenham told you this was special.\n\nThe New Zealand All Blacks perform the haka ahead of the game against England at Twickenham.\n\nThe match was also billed as a clash of styles. The All Blacks' electric, attacking rugby -- yielding an average of four tries in its last 12 games -- against England's tighter, more forward oriented game.\n\nFrom the outset, Jones' men were muscular, fired up, and precise. They met the Kiwi rapier with a cutlass and cudgel.\n\nA flowing early move sent winger Ashton -- also back for the first time in four years -- over in the right corner.\n\nAs if on cue, the stadium PA pumped out the Stones' \"Start Me Up,\" and it was clear England had picked up the challenge of the haka and run with it.\n\nA second try followed, this time from a ferocious forward surge off a lineout to put co-captain Hartley over.\n\nAs England surged to a 15-0 lead it looked as if rugby's axis was in full tilt.\n\nEngland wing Chris Ashton scored the opening try against New Zealand at Twickenham.\n\nEngland push over Dylan Hartley to score against New Zealand.\n\n'Purring'\n\nBut like a wily hunter stalking its prey, New Zealand remained patient, prodding and probing.\n\nAnd when opportunity knocked the men in black struck with clinical precision.\n\nSlick handling in a pre-arranged backs move put full back Damian McKenzie under England's posts. Beauden Barrett added the conversion and landed a penalty shortly after to go in at the break 15-10 down but on the up.\n\nThe All Blacks' engine was purring again after half time, only for a rare dropped pass to scupper a certain try.\n\nUndeterred, England had a near miss of its own, but despite hammering away near the Kiwi line it couldn't quite find a way through.\n\nAs Jones admitted, those are the chances you must take against the All Blacks, because when Barrett slotted a drop-goal and then another penalty on the hour mark, New Zealand were suddenly in front.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, handed All Blacks captain Kieran Read the Hillary Shield.\n\n'Trust and belief'\n\nThe All Blacks are renowned for their ability to snuff out tiring opposition in the last quarter, but England hung on tight at Twickenham.\n\n\"New Zealand generally run away from teams in those areas but they couldn't,\" said Jones.\n\nWhen flanker Sam Underhill turned Barrett inside out and looked to have scored in the left corner off a charged down kick with five minutes left, the majority of the 80,000 crowd erupted with roars that reverberated down the nearby River Thames.\n\nBut the referee opted for a TV review and England lock Courtney Lawes was adjudged marginally offside in charging down the kick.\n\nAll Blacks' coach Steve Hansen claimed there was \"no doubt\" it was offside, but said later he was just worried the officials would be \"brave enough\" to make such a crucial decision.\n\n\"I thought England were very good, but I thought we showed a lot of character to be down 15-0 in a hostile environment, with 79,000 not being Kiwis, and the weather conditions -- it wasn't conducive to being able to play razzle-dazzle rugby -- and the boys stuck with it,\" said Hansen.\n\nNew Zealand captain Kieran Read added: \"For us it's about trust and belief. We just had to work things out.\"\n\nSam Underhill's late try for England was disallowed.\n\nAfter talking to reporters, Hansen set off to find his old mate Jones for a beer.\n\nThey'll have much to discuss over the next 12 months.\n\n\"It was a fantastic game of rugby,\" said Jones.\n\n\"I tell you, we're excited about where we're going.\"\n\nEngland takes on Japan next week, while New Zealand moves on to face Ireland in Dublin.",

    "text": "(CNN) Stan Lee, the colorful Marvel Comics patriarch who helped usher in a new era of superhero storytelling -- and saw his creations become a giant influence in the movie business -- has died.\n\nHe was 95.\n\nKirk Schneck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, tells CNN the comic giant was taken by ambulance from his Los Angeles home on Monday morning to Cedar's Sinai Medical Center, where he later died. The cause of death is not yet known, according to Schneck.\n\nLee began his career at what was then Timely Comics in 1939. Over the years he was a writer, editor and occasional illustrator. But, bored with the output, he was preparing to leave the company when history took a sudden turn.\n\nFor many years, the business had been dominated by DC (then National) Comics, creators of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern.\n\nIn the late '50s, DC started reimagining its heroes -- kicking off what comics historians call the \"Silver Age\" of the business -- but those figures were still, largely, otherworldly and two-dimensional, living in made-up places such as Metropolis and Gotham City.\n\nPhotos: Comic book legend Stan Lee Photos: Comic book legend Stan Lee Stan Lee poses next to a Spider-Man model at his office in 2008.

Hide Caption 32 of 32\n\nIn the early '60s, Lee was asked to come up with a team of superheroes to compete against DC's Justice League. With the notable help of artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he helped instigate a revolution, though Lee didn't see it that way at the time.\n\n\"If my publisher hadn't said 'let's do superhero stories,' I'd probably still be doing 'A Kid Called Outlaw,' 'The Two-Gun Kid' or 'Millie the Model' or whatever I was doing at the time,\" he told CNN in 2013.\n\nMarvel revitalized the comics business with a series of flawed, more human superheroes. Its figures lived in the real world -- a few were based in New York City, with all its dirt and clamor -- and struggled with everyday challenges, whether it was paying the rent or wondering about their purposes in life.\n\nFirst came the Fantastic Four, a superhero team probably most famous for the grumpy, rock-skinned Thing. Following that success Lee and Marvel introduced such characters as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, the X-Men and Daredevil.\n\nThese new superheroes -- all created in a burst between 1961 and 1964 -- were hugely popular and allowed Marvel to surpass DC in both sales and fashionableness.\n\nSpider-Man, in particular, became the imprint's signature character: a neurotic photographer named Peter Parker who, after being bitten by a radioactive spider, develops spider-like powers. Parker was forever clashing with newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (an angry, cigar-chomping martinet who was no Perry White), wondering about his relationship with Mary Jane Watson and worrying about his fragile Aunt May. Crime fighting was the least of his concerns.\n\n\"I never thought that Spider-Man would become the worldwide icon that he is. I just hoped the books would sell and I'd keep my job,\" Lee said in 2006.\n\nMany of the characters were developed for television with varying degrees of success. But it was the emergence of the \"Marvel Universe\" in the movies, especially with the \"X-Men\" franchise and the Sam Raimi-directed \"Spider-Man\" (2002), that truly made the brand ubiquitous. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment -- the licensing arm of the comic-book brand -- for $4 billion.\n\nBy that point, Lee had long since become more of a company figurehead rather than a writer and editor in the day-to-day trenches. He became the company's editorial director and publisher in 1972 and eventually immersed himself in spreading the Marvel gospel (often with the exclamation, \"Excelsior!\") He's had bit parts in most of the films featuring the company's characters.\n\nHe was occasionally criticized for egotistically cheerleading for himself as much as Marvel. \"Stan the Brand,\" the authors of \"Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book\" called him, pointedly.\n\nIt wasn't all joy for Lee. Though the success of the movies made the characters worth billions, Lee maintained that he saw little of that wealth. Even so, he saw more than artist Kirby, who many comics historians credit with molding a number of characters. Over the years, the credit for the characters -- and, therefore, the profits -- has been the subject of court cases, some involving Kirby or his family.\n\nThe characters' impact, however, is indisputable.\n\nMarvel characters are known the world over, and its films have become huge successes.\n\n\"I used to be embarrassed because I was just a comic-book writer while other people were building bridges or going on to medical careers,\" he told the Washington Post. \"And then I began to realize: entertainment is one of the most important things in people's lives. Without it they might go off the deep end. I feel that if you're able to entertain people, you're doing a good thing.\"\n\nHe retained a lifelong passion for the medium he helped mold, and wouldn't tolerate disdain.\n\n\"Comic book should be written as one word. So from now on, I want you to remember that,\" he said in a 2012 YouTube video. \"They are not funny books. They are not comic books, they are comicbooks! Remember that, or incur my wrath.\"\n\nThe couple had a true partnership and Marvel fans came to know Joan Lee for her voice-over work as Miss Forbes and Madame Web in the animated versions of \"Fantastic Four\" and \"Spider-Man.\" She also had a cameo in \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" in 2016.\n\n\"The whole thing has been confusing to everyone, including myself and the fans, but I am now happy to be surrounded by those who want the best for me,\" Lee said in a statement. \"I am thrilled to put the lawsuit behind me, get back to business with my friends and colleagues at POW! and launch the next wave of amazing characters and stories!\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Stan Lee was ready to give up on writing comic books in 1960 -- after 20 years in the business -- when his wife, famously, urged him to try writing one that he would like.\n\nThe result was Fantastic Four - a team of squabbling superheroes -- kicking off a string of creations with artist Jack Kirby that redefined their medium and, with the popularity of Marvel movies, has since come to occupy an enormous role in pop culture.\n\nThe Lee-Kirby collaboration has been likened, with some justification, to the comic-book version of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, another creative super-team of the 1960s. In short order, the duo launched the Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, Iron Man, a revived version of Captain America and Ant-Man, while Lee added perhaps Marvel's most renowned character, Spider-Man, with Steve Ditko.\n\nDespite their colorful costumes and cosmic powers, the Marvel heroes grappled with real-world problems, and went on to address serious social issues. Lee -- who died Monday, at age 95 -- also developed a way of working with artists that empowered them, blocking out stories -- in part out of necessity, given the number of titles he was writing -- then adding dialogue when the illustrated pages came back.\n\nBeyond his creations, in Lee, comic books had an ebullient cheerleader and goodwill ambassador, a self-described \"ham\" who toured college campuses proselytizing on Marvel's behalf. In later years, Lee reveled in his Hitchcock-style movie cameos and introduced himself as \"Stan Lee, Creative Giant\" on his business cards.\n\nRead More",

Given that, National Geographic Channel's \"Inside North Korea's Dynasty\" feels like a timely public service, pulling back the curtain on \"the story of the Kims, a family of dictators.\"\n\nThe four-part documentary, scheduled over two Sunday nights, analyzes North Korea's \"strange psychology,\" rooted in the indignities suffered under Japanese occupation before the end of World War II. Part I is thus devoted to Kim Il Sung, a guerrilla fighter who came to power and solidified his hold over the country after Korea's arbitrary division along the 38th parallel.\n\nFilled with rich detail, the documentary features harrowing accounts from those who lived through those years, such as an interview with a commando who participated in a failed raid intended to kill the South Korean leader, which prompted the execution of the soldier's parents.\n\nThe narrative proceeds to the unexpected rise of son Kim Jong Il, initially seen as long shot to assume power. He's described as \"a spoiled rich kid, raised like a prince,\" who loved movies (including a particular fondness for James Bond films) and used propaganda as the means to become his father's heir. That includes an utterly bizarre interlude in the late 1970s when he kidnapped South Korean director Shin Sang-ok and his movie-star wife, Choi Eun-hee, who were forced to work in North Korea before the couple escaped.\n\nNot for the faint of heart, the special chronicles a series of horrors, including mass starvation, using executions to squelch labor unrest and the terrorist bombing of a South Korean airliner, as North Korea chafed at having been denied a chance to help host the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) \"The Front Runner\" captures what turned out to be pivotal moment in politics and media, zeroing in on the moment when the look-the-other-way mentality about candidates' personal indiscretions forever changed. At its core, too, is how that shift torpedoed the 1988 presidential run by Gary Hart, played with convincing indignation by Hugh Jackman.\n\n\"A lot can happen in three weeks,\" the film notes at the outset, proceeding to chronicle the rapid downfall of Hart's candidacy, after he was exposed cavorting on a yacht with Donna Rice (Sara Paxton). It was, it's noted, not the first time he had strayed from his wife (Vera Farmiga), including separations in the past.\n\nWhat's different, this time, is that Hart is running for president, and -- in a moment of pique -- suggests to a reporter that he'd be bored if he followed him around. Eager to make its mark on the campaign, the Miami Herald seizes on the comment to justify staking out Hart's townhouse, creating a problem that Hart is slow to recognize or acknowledge, snapping \"How is it relevant?\" when the issue of infidelity arises.\n\nDirector Jason Reitman (who co-wrote the script with Jay Carson and reporter Matt Bai, based on the latter's book) provides a lot of inside-baseball looks at both the Hart team and the newsrooms covering it. That includes Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee (Alfred Molina) -- who reminiscences about ignoring John F. Kennedy's marital transgressions, only to be reminded that it's a \"different time.\"\n\nThere's also Hart campaign manager Bill Dixon (J.K. Simmons, as always, terrific), who struggles to convey the magnitude of what's unfolding to his wonky, policy-oriented boss, who insists on waging a \"campaign of ideas,\" already prone to resist the photo ops and family blather that, an aide notes, isn't in his \"comfort zone.\"\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) \"Overlord\" is a decided throwback -- an old-fashioned \"B\" movie cocktail, mashing together a perilous World War II mission, horror and science fiction, against the historical backdrop of saving D-Day. On the most basic level, it works as an action vehicle, even if the bare-bones plot lacks the ingenuity to sustain its promising start down the stretch.\n\nForgoing high-profile stars, the movie's promotion has focused on J.J. Abrams, even if he's only a producer here, leaving the directing chores to Australian filmmaker Julius Avery. Then again, Abrams produced \"Cloverfield,\" which also confounded expectations by weaving a horror-monster movie together with what felt like an episode of \"Felicity.\"\n\nThe mix-and-match genres idea certainly has its appeal, especially for those steeped in movie conventions. And \"Overlord\" takes off with considerable energy, as a small group of U.S. soldiers (notably color-blind in the casting) survive a harrowing parachute drop into Nazi-occupied France, where their task is to take out a heavily guarded German communications tower, making air cover possible for the D-Day landing.\n\nSaid tower resides in an old church, and the horrors that lurk within go beyond even the customary crimes of the Nazis. Those flourishes bring the film (written by Billy Ray and Mark L. Smith) into the sci-fi and alternate history realms, although no one will confuse this consciously popcorn-y exercise with \"Inglourious Basterds\" or \"The Man in the High Castle.\"\n\nWhile there's a lot going on, the basic character beats are easily identifiable, employing a kind of shorthand with both the heroes and villains. There's the unproven new private (Jovan Adepo) who will be forced to find reservoirs of strength; the hard-bitten, taciturn corporal (Wyatt Russell) steadfastly committed to the mission; and the young French women (Mathilde Ollivier) who winds up helping them, having seen what monsters the Nazis are, separate from what's transpiring in the basement of that church.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" remains arguably the best of TV's animated Christmas specials. Yet the Chuck Jones/Dr. Seuss holiday classic is a model of storytelling economy, whereas the new version, \"Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,\" captures sparks of that magic while straining to treble its size -- like the Grinch's small heart, only here for theatrical purposes.\n\nIn that regard, this \"Grinch,\" which features Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of the title character, has a good deal in common with \"The Lorax,\" another Illumination Entertainment adaptation of a Seuss staple, which felt similarly labored in fleshing out its story.\n\nTo its credit, a few of the new elements in \"The Grinch\" are pretty nifty, perhaps most notably an expanded visual representation of Whoville, the idyllic town whose Christmas festivities become the object of the Grinch's ire. The other major additions are both new -- little Cindy Lou Who, in this telling way more than two, is now the concerned daughter of a single mom struggling to make ends meet -- and very old, providing the Grinch an origin story that vaguely echoes why young Ebenezer Scrooge was so hostile to the holidays.\n\nOther tacked-on elements are colorful, if fairly broad and garishly comedic, from an overweight reindeer who becomes part of the Grinch's plot to an ebullient Whoville resident Bricklebaum (Kenan Thompson) whose wholesale embrace of Christmas cheer represents everything that the Grinch isn't.\n\nMuch of that feels like filler, perhaps inevitably, as the Grinch builds up to the idea of stealing the Whos' Christmas; devises an elaborate plan to execute his scheme; and finally, comes to recognize the true spirit of the season, which, as Cindy Lou's mom (Rashida Jones) tells her, is about more than mere \"stuff.\"\n\nRead More",

The result is a slick thriller that trades in some of the moody atmosphere that draped earlier versions for a more straightforward action vehicle.\n\nFoy -- miles away from her role in \"The Crown\" -- drops the tiara and picks up a taser as the latest Lisbeth Salander, the aforementioned hacker. The film comes seven years after the U.S. version of \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\" which itself followed a trio of Swedish-language movies adapting the late Stieg Larsson's books.\n\nWorking here from another story written by David Lagercrantz, who assumed authorship of the series, the plot begins with a flashback to Lisbeth's dark youth and the life she escaped, before jumping to the present, where she's shown dispensing her own brand of justice.\n\nEnlisted to help an inventor (Stephen Merchant) who has created a dangerous computer weapon, Lisbeth suddenly finds herself in the crosshairs of a very bad, ruthless cabal. While she's not the kind to grow overly attached to people or possessions -- including, fortunately, her apartment -- she vows to \"take back what he stole from me,\" a decision with ominous consequences.\n\nDirected by Fede Alvarez (from a script he adapted with Jay Fasu), this \"Spider's Web\" is aptly named, inasmuch as there are several strands that unspool simultaneously before gradually coming together. Those include the journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Swedish actor Sverrir Gudnason), who seeks to assist Lisbeth; and an American national-security agent (Lakeith Stanfield), who journeys to Stockholm seeking to recover the stolen item for the U.S.\n\nRead More",

The United States is demanding that China come up with a clear offer before negotiations on a trade deal can start, but Beijing wants to talk first and then make a firm proposal later, according to the report\n\nChinese government officials declined to comment directly on the reported call between Mnuchin and Liu, but acknowledged recent communications following a phone conversation earlier this month between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n\"The two countries' economic teams are in touch to implement the consensus reached by the two leaders,\" Chinese Assistant Commerce Minister Li Chenggang said at a news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. \"We hope to achieve positive results with efforts from both sides.\"\n\nA US Treasury spokesman did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the matter late Monday.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet face to face at the G20 summit later this month in Argentina.\n\nThe reported talks between Mnuchin and Liu are the latest attempt to try to find a way out of the trade war between the two economic superpowers that has resulted in heavy tariffs on huge swathes of each other's exports. But doubts remain over whether they can reach a deal anytime soon.\n\nFriday's talks didn't resolve the stalemate between the two sides, but were seen as positive step toward reaching an understanding, the Journal reported.\n\nThe Trump administration has already slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products since July. The tariffs on $200 billion of those goods are set to increase to 25% from 10% on January 1, which would further escalate the conflict.\n\nChina has so far retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of US products and is likely to respond with more if the United States goes ahead with the increase at the start of January.\n\nThe United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese products ranging from food seasonings and baseball gloves to network routers and industrial machinery parts. China's retaliatory tariffs have hit thousands of US exports including meat, alcoholic drinks, chemicals, clothes, machinery, furniture and auto parts.\n\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages about whether the two countries are nearing a truce.\n\nThe Trump administration is divided between free traders \u2014 including those with Wall Street backgrounds like Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow \u2014 and hardliners like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nKudlow highlighted the differences between the two sides last month when he said, \"China has not responded positively to any of our asks.\"\n\nBut Trump has been talking up the prospects for a positive meeting with Xi.\n\n\"We'll have a good meeting and we're going to see what we can do,\" he said at a news conference last week following the midterm elections. Days before US voters headed to the polls, Trump said he and Xi had held \"productive\" talks over the phone call, but he didn't specify any details.\n\nStill, fault lines between the United States and China were on clear display Friday during a meeting between senior military officials, who challenged each other over the South China Sea, Taiwan, religious freedom and trade.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to take an aggressive stance against China for what he says are unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. He's threatened to escalate the trade war further by imposing tariffs on all the remaining goods that China sells to the United States.\n\nMany American manufacturers, farmers and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they appreciate the administration's efforts to change China's trade policies. But some argue the tariffs aren't the best way to address the problems. They pose a dilemma for US importers who must decide whether to absorb the higher cost of the goods or pass it on to consumers, and some exporters are hurting from China's retaliatory tariffs.\n\nFormer White House economic adviser Gary Cohn left the administration earlier this year in the wake of a fierce disagreement over tariffs on steel and aluminum. Earlier this week, Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, told the BBC that Trump's tariffs could hurt the US economy.\n\n\"I look at tariffs as a bit of a consumption tax [and] we do not want to tax our consumers when they're going to spend their disposable income on what we produce, which is services,\" he said.",

Trump's terms -- not Wall Street terms,\" he said.\n\n\"If Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into these negotiations, there will be a stench around any deal that's consummated because it will have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street,\" Navarro added.\n\nNavarro, a former economics professor, accused billionaires and hedge fund managers of engaging in \"shuttle diplomacy\" between the United States and China, which he says weakens the President and his negotiating position. It wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to.\n\nHis remarks come ahead of Trump's expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit later this month in Argentina. The administration has sent mixed messages about whether the two are nearing a truce that would lift more than $250 billion in retaliatory tariffs on an array of goods ranging from chemical products and motors to luggage and hats.\n\nThe comments reflect the ongoing divisions inside the Trump administration between free traders -- including those with Wall Street backgrounds like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow -- and the so-called nationalists, who hew to the \"America First\" stance laid out during the campaign and early months of Trump's presidency by former chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\n\"Wall Street is a very easy boogeyman to attack in situations like these,\" said Rufus Yerxa, a former US trade official who now leads the National Foreign Trade Council, in an interview with CNN. \"But look, the concern about making sure that the US gets the right results in China without provoking a trade war comes from Main Street, and from the American companies that make things, produce jobs and export stuff.\"\n\nYerxa said his members, which include companies like Google, Walmart, Visa, General Electric and Caterpillar, have been offering input to the Trump administration wherever possible, but notes there's still \"a bit of confusion\" over which direction the White House may be going given ongoing internal discussions.\n\n\"We don't have any clear sense of where they are,\" said Yerxa, referring to any developing proposals. \"A lot of the business community isn't being brought into details of that.\"\n\nTrump earlier this week promised a positive meeting with Xi.\n\n\"We'll have a good meeting and we're going to see what we can do,\" the President said at his Wednesday news conference following the midterm elections.\n\nBut fault lines between the US and China were on clear display Friday during a meeting between senior military officials, who challenged each other over the South China Sea , Taiwan, religious freedom and trade.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to take an aggressive stance against China for what he says are unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.

Sidecar Tours Vietnam\n\n\"Hanoi was founded over 1,000 years ago but the Old Quarter is even older than that,\" says Christensen, who has lived in Hanoi for more than 20 years.\n\n\"Each street is associated with a product, and each product is associated with a village.\"\n\nRelated content Hanoi's best boutique hotels\n\nTake Hang Chieu Street, for example.

    "text": "This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .\n\n(CNN) What if you could live longer just by doing more of what you love to do most?\n\nIt's an attractive theory that finds its evidence in a community on the island of Okinawa that's nicknamed the Village of Longevity because its residents have the highest life expectancy in the world. They also largely share a devotion to a Japanese philosophy known as ikigai, over-simply translated as the happiness derived from being busy at some activity that holds meaning and purpose for them.\n\nOgimi, the friendly village of 3,000 of the world's longest-living people, is known for its slow pace, ocean views, community gatherings, personal vegetable gardens and residents who smile, laugh and joke incessantly. They also take great pride in living to 100 and beyond. They have fewer chronic illnesses than most people, including cancer and heart disease, and their rate of dementia is well below the global average.\n\nThe answer is probably a combination of factors that include the usual suspects: diet, movement/exercise and having friends and community. What these \"blue zone\" areas of longevity and happiness around the world have in common are residents who curate a simple life with few possessions, plenty of time outdoors, staying active with friends, getting enough sleep, and eating lightly and healthily.\n\nWhat the long-lived Japanese add to this list is ikigai, a concept that is, at times, used synonymously with purpose, passion, meaning, mission, vocation and drive. If you brew all those notions together and distill its contents, you get ikigai.\n\nFinding your ikigai\n\nIkigai has been drawn in books and articles as the center of a Venn diagram in which your answers to these questions all overlap: What do you love? What are you good at? What can you be paid for? What does the world need? When you find the answer that fits all four questions, that's your ikigai.\n\nAnother way of defining your own ikigai is to simply ask yourself: Why do you get up in the morning? Or, what motivates you?\n\nOr as Viktor Frankl put it, \"Why do you not commit suicide?\" Frankl, a psychiatrist and neurologist, is the creator of a type of therapy infused with spiritual themes known as logotherapy. He was also the author of \"Man's Search for Meaning,\" about how his experience surviving the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz taught him that a purpose-driven life is the answer to overcoming obstacles and sorrows.\n\nKen Mogi, a Japanese neuroscientist and author of \"Awakening Your Ikigai: How the Japanese Wake Up to Joy and Purpose Every Day\" equates the ethos for ikigai to the famous British government slogan from World War II posters: \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"\n\nFrankl's logotherapy aims to help patients find their purpose in life. (\"Logos\" is the Greek word for \"meaning.\") If you feel anxious or empty, it's because you are having an existential crisis, Frankl argued. Logotherapy tends to be more forward looking rather than, say, looking for roots of discontent in your childhood.\n\nTherapy is one way to find your ikigai, which is the \"existential fuel\" that motivates us to live long and happy, as Garc\u00eda and Miralles put it. Less expensive than therapy is asking yourself the question \"what is the meaning of my life?\" and pursuing activities that support your answer.\n\nEven more simple is the question \"what do I love doing most?\" Your ikigai may lie in the activities that tend to induce a state of being fully and delightfully immersed in that action, what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called \"flow\" and Abraham Maslow called \"peak experiences.\"\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, suggested another question to get at your ikigai: \"If money were no object ... what would I regret not having done with my life?\"\n\nThere's no single way to learn your ikigai, and the individual answers are even more varied. Your ikigai may be devotion to friends, cooking, being a good parent, writing, scientific inquiry, fighting climate change, drawing, helping your neighbors and on and on.\n\nGarc\u00eda and Miralles interviewed elderly residents of Ogimi, Japan, about their individual ikigai, and their answers included, \"I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself,\" \"getting together with my friends\" and \"making things with wicker.\" Ikigai doesn't need to be lofty or complicated, and it's better not to stress about it. Ikigai is largely just the activity that will blissfully keep you busy until the end of your days. (And by pursuing it, you'll probably have more of those days.)\n\n\"You need to find your ikigai in the little things. You've got to start small. You need to be here and now,\" Mogi writes. \"Most crucially, you cannot and should not blame the environment for a lack of ikigai. After all, it is up to you to find your own ikigai, in your own way.\"\n\nOnce you do that, even if you don't live to age 100, your life may feel longer because you are more fully engaged with it while you are here.\n\nAnd living with purpose will encourage other behavior that promotes longevity. \"Having ikigai would induce you to lead a healthier lifestyle, with more exercise, increased social activities, and life-long learning,\" Mogi wrote to me in an email.\n\nI also asked Mogi about his own personal ikigai. \"I used to chase butterflies and study them as a kid. Now, going for a run in the morning is my ikigai. Connecting to people of different backgrounds, going over the borders of language, ethnicity, and nationality, is probably the greatest ikigai of my life now,\" he wrote. \"So ikigai can be small and big, both of them equally important in one's life. Ikigai is a spectrum.\"\n\nAs I think of my own ikigai, the activities that give me the most flow are creative ones, mostly writing (you are reading my ikigai!), storytelling and sharing experiences with my wife and kids. I like to think that these pursuits will have a wider impact on the world, too. If I could spend every day for the rest of life pursuing those activities, I'd die very happy and apparently very old.\n\nYou and your ikigai: Till delayed death do you part\n\nOnce you find your ikigai, there is really no reason to ever retire from it. The Japanese apparently don't even have a word for \"retire.\" It's the not retiring from your purpose-driven life that seems to be the key factor of longevity and happiness on Okinawa.\n\nIt's not as easy as that sounds, of course. \"Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning,\" Garc\u00eda and Miralles write. \"Powerful forces and incentives (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don't let them take over your life.\"\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nInstead, they advise, follow your curiosity and intuition, which are the paths back to ikigai, as is self-awareness. Find the activity you love, surround yourself with people you love, and stay true to that internal compass.\n\nMogi has more advice on keeping your ikigai engine running smoothly. His five points boil down to: focus on the details, accept yourself, rely on others, enjoy pleasure and stay present.\n\n\"There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end,\" Garc\u00eda and Miralles write.\n\nOr, great mythology teacher Joseph Campbell summed the more than 1,000 words of advice in this story into just three: \"Follow your bliss.\"",

It also wanted a suburban or urban area with more than 1 million people and access to mass transit.\n\nThe company said the new facility would create as many as 50,000 jobs and cost at least $5 billion to build and operate.\n\nThe announcement sent cities into a frenzy, with some making elaborate moves to attract Amazon's attention.

    "text": "New York (CNN Business) American oil executives will sleep a bit better tonight after Saudi Arabia signaled it's coming to the rescue of the battered crude market.\n\nSaudi Arabia announced plans on Sunday to cut shipments by half a million barrels per day in December. And the kingdom threw its weight behind OPEC and its allies reducing supply further next year.\n\nIt's a big reversal. Just months ago Saudi Arabia, under pressure from President Donald Trump , was opening up the taps in a bid to prevent $100 oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia's 180 is good news for US shale companies, especially high-debt frackers that are sensitive to price swings. It signals that the world's largest oil exporter won't stand for crude crashing any further.\n\n\"If you are a producer in Texas, you have to be happy with the fact that there is a swing supplier in the market that wants to keep prices supported,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.\n\nFears about oversupply sent US oil prices plunging into a bear market last week . Those concerns were driven in part by developments in the United States.\n\nFirst, US shale companies ramped up production faster than anyone anticipated. US output topped 11 million barrels per day in August for the first time ever.\n\nSecond, the Trump administration granted temporary waivers to China, India and other countries to keep buying oil from Iran. The softer-than-expected approach prevented sanctions from knocking too many Iranian barrels offline.\n\n'We need a floor!'\n\nUS oil prices declined 10 straight days through Friday.\n\n\"We need a floor! It's been quite a month,\" Dan Eberhart, CEO of oilfield services company Canary LLC, told CNN Business.\n\nSaudi energy minister Khalid Al Falih suggested the kingdom wants to do just that.\n\n\"The consensus among all members is that we need to do whatever it takes to balance the market,\" Al Falih said at a conference in Abu Dhabi Monday. \"If that means trimming supply by a million [barrels per day], we will do it.\"\n\nThe odds are \"fairly high\" that OPEC and its allies will announce next month a production cut of about 1 million barrels per day, according to Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital.\n\nUS oil prices initially jumped around 1% on Monday, defying a selloff in the stock market. However, the rally faded and crude settled below $60 a barrel. The 11-day slump is the longest slump since futures trading began in 1983.\n\nWhile the Dow dropped nearly 2%, some oil companies with shale exposure, including Hess ( HES ) and Pioneer Natural Resources ( PXD ), outperformed.\n\n\"For oil companies, whether shale or anywhere else, obviously the higher the better as far as prices go,\" said Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst at Raymond James.\n\nMolchanov cautioned that companies make their investment decisions based on long-term oil price forecasts, not short-term moves.\n\nFrackers took on debt\n\nStill, some small and medium-sized frackers piled on debt to take advantage of opportunities in the Permian Basin and other shale oilfields. That debt makes these companies vulnerable to short-term changes in cash flow caused by swings in prices.\n\nUS oil companies sensitive to oil price movements include frackers like Whiting Petroleum ( WLL ) and Oasis Petroleum as well as California Resources and Kosmos Energy ( KOS ), according to analysts.\n\nLarge independent producers such as EOG Resources ( EOG ) and Devon Energy ( DVN ) are also somewhat levered to prices because they only produce the raw commodity.\n\nOil supermajors, such as ExxonMobil ( XOM ), Chevron ( CVX ) and BP ( BP ), are more insulated to price swings because they are diversified. All three own refining businesses that give them a natural hedge when prices crash.\n\nNo price war this time\n\nSaudi Arabia has its own reasons for defending prices. Brent crude needs to fetch around $89 a barrel in order for the kingdom to balance its 2018 budget, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That's well above current prices.\n\nIn 2014-2015, Saudi Arabia took a much different approach aimed at easing a supply glut. At the time the kingdom flooded the market with excess oil in a bid to drown out high-cost producers, including shale companies in the United States.\n\nCheap oil -- crude dropped to $26 a barrel in early 2016 -- caused dozens of oil companies to file for bankruptcy and led to countless layoffs. But shale oil companies emerged from the crash with stronger balance sheets and better technology.\n\nIt seems that Saudi Arabia doesn't have a desire to fight that war against US shale again.",

The goal is to eventually make the system work with a range of cars and brands.\n\n\"BMW have a counter, which counts down 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 second to green, while Mercedes says 'if you drive between 32 and 52 kilometers per hour, you'll get green,'\" said Franz Schober from Siemens' Connected Mobility Systems team.\n\nVolkswagen will start equipping cars with the technology next year.\n\nThe network uses WiFi technology and sensors to produce position data than is more accurate than GPS, the location system used in smartphones.\n\nThe system will help cars avoid unnecessary stopping and starting, reducing the amount of gasses they emit. Cars produce more emissions when idling than when in motion.\n\nThe technology could also help improve safety by transmitting information about traffic conditions directly to the driver.\n\nVolkswagen and Siemens are using sensors to detect pedestrians and cyclists at two of the crossroads in Wolfsburg.\n\n\"[The sensors] process that information, and then the traffic controller can send a message to everyone that there is a cyclist on the left,\" Schober said.\n\nSensors above the traffic light can detect cyclists and pedestrians (illustration provided by VW).\n\nOther carmakers are working on similar technology.\n\nEarlier in October, Honda showed off its \"smart intersection\" technology in a town in Ohio.\n\nThe Japanese company mounted four cameras in each corner of an intersection, creating a 360 bird's-eye-view of cars and pedestrians moving around. That data was then sent to connected cars and decoded by their on-board computers.\n\nWhen necessary, the system provides visual and audible alerts to the driver.\n\nFord is going even further. The company unveiled technology earlier this month that allows cars to communicate with each other when going through a crossroads. Drivers are advised to change their speed if necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nThe company said it took inspiration from how pedestrians move around in a crowd to avoid those crossing their path, adding it envisions the technology to make traffic lights obsolete in the future.",

The others were Midtown West, the Brooklyn Tech Triangle and Lower Manhattan.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday that Amazon plans to divide its second headquarters evenly between two cities instead of picking one winner. According to the Journal's sources, the rationale behind selecting two cities is to recruit enough technical talent.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the New York Times report.\n\nHere's what we know about where HQ2 plans stand.\n\nWhat qualities is Amazon seeking for HQ2?\n\nThe expected 50,000 people who will eventually work at the new headquarters will bring a huge economic boost to the winning city \u2014 or cities. The fact that the jobs pay well makes the opportunity even more attractive.\n\nBut the cities must have certain attributes.\n\nIn its request for proposals, Amazon outlined several criteria for HQ2, such as proximity to a major airport and the ability to attract technical talent. It must be a suburban or urban area with more than 1 million people. Amazon also said it was looking for communities that offer a \"stable and business-friendly\" environment and access to mass transit.\n\nWhich cities are still in the running, and who are the top contenders?\n\nDepends on who you ask.\n\nAmazon announced a list of 20 finalists for HQ2 in January, including: Atlanta; Austin; Boston; Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Denver; Indianapolis; Los Angeles; Miami; Montgomery County, Maryland; Nashville; Newark; New York City; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh; Toronto; and Washington, DC.\n\nOver the past weekend, The Washington Post reported that Northern Virginia's Crystal City was in advanced talks with Amazon for the second headquarters.

According to the Journal's sources, talks with other cities \u2014 such as Denver, Toronto and Nashville \u2014 appear to have fizzled out.\n\nAn Amazon executive took a swipe at the Washington Post report on Saturday. \"Memo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, VA as #HQ2 selection.

    "text": "Bedford, New Hampshire Roger Brown still remembers the shocked looks people gave him the first time he rode a Segway through the halls of the company's New Hampshire headquarters.\n\nIt was early 2013, a rough time for the startup and its aspirations of changing how the world gets around . Brown had bought the company for just $9 million a few weeks before and flown in from his home in Tennessee to begin turning things around. What better way to get a sense of the place than to zip about on its signature product?\n\nAs Brown cruised the halls on the self-balancing two-wheeled scooter, an employee pulled him aside to lecture him on the risks of riding without a helmet. Brown was dumbfounded. \"I own the company,\" he told the employee. \"I can do it.\" With that, he whizzed away.\n\nA few hours later, he received an email outlining the company's safety policies, which included mandatory helmet use. Either Brown would change his ways, or he'd be written up.\n\nAll these years later, he still finds it more than a bit silly. \"You would've thought I went to the Baptist convention and walked around with a pro-abortion sign,\" he said recently.\n\nThe fuss over a helmet was the least of Brown's problems. He was the third person to own Segway, which had grabbed headlines in 2001 with the Segway PT and a promise to supplant the automobile and reinvent transportation. Instead, the company's flagship product became a punchline and the company a mess. In the years before Brown bought Segway, a half-dozen CEOs had come and gone, many of its best engineers had defected, and the VCs who had once showered Segway in cash had moved on to the next big thing.\n\nThere was a significant dork factor. It was never truly socially accepted. Matt Gelbwaks, early Segway employee\n\nBrown bought the company from the estate of Jimi Heselden, a British entrepreneur who died after riding his Segway off a cliff. Segway was barely getting by on the meager revenue it brought in selling the PT to tour companies, security companies and police departments. But Brown saw a global brand with a powerful distribution channel. Six million tourists rode Segways on tours of cities like San Francisco and Washington, DC each year. He planned to buy other transportation companies focused on short trips, like e-bike startups. All he had to do to make Segway profitable, he figured, was run the place well.\n\nBrown brought on new employees to change Segway's uptight culture. He led an effort to trim costs by reengineering a circuit board, ditching the PT's expensive gyroscope in favor of a cheaper solution, and negotiating a better battery contract. It worked. Segway turned a profit within a year of Brown's arrival. He sold the company to the Chinese firm Ninebot on April 1, 2015 for more than $75 million.\n\nFor a time, he was happy. Then one day in August of this year, he got lunch at the Boathouse, a barbecue joint in Cincinnati. As he ate wings and pulled pork sliders, Brown noticed people riding scooters along the riverwalk outside, and not just any scooters: Segway scooters.\n\nNinebot introduced the Segway scooters shortly after Brown cashed out, triggering the scooter-sharing craze that has swept the world in the last year. You can find Ninebot's scooters in more than 100 cities, from the Americas to Asia, Europe and Australia. Ninebot can barely keep up. The company, which has more than 1,000 employees, will ship more than one million scooters this year \u2014 10 times the number of PTs Segway sold in its first 17 years.\n\nhave responded by launching their own scooter services this fall. So has Ford. All rely on Ninebot scooters. Silicon Valley-backed Bird and Lime, both of which launched in 2017 , lead the trend. They're growing faster than the ridesharing leaders, Uber and Lyft, did in their early days. Uber and Lyfthave responded by launching their own scooter services this fall. So has Ford. All rely on Ninebot scooters.\n\n\"If I would've had the vision of Bird or Lime,\" Brown said, \"Segway would have been worth $10 billion.\"\n\nScooters are built at Ninebot's factory in China.\n\nWhen Brown owned the company, he focused on the Segway PT, which cost thousands of dollars. It had always been too expensive and ahead of its time.\n\nNow, though, the urban transportation revolution that Segway founder Dean Kamen and his truly gifted engineers dreamed of is unfolding, even if they aren't a part of it. Many are thrilled.\n\n\"We knew this was the way future transportation products would work,\" said former Segway lead engineer Doug Field, who has since worked at Apple and Tesla . \"Anyone standing on something that's powered by electricity and a computer is a Segway descendant.\"\n\nThe next big thing\n\nKamen is a colorful character, even among techies. He dropped out of college. He flies about in his own helicopter. He owns an island off the coast of Connecticut, and has joked about founding his own nation.\n\nHe's also one hell of an inventor. Kamen made his name developing medical devices, such as a portable insulin pump and heart stents. In the 1990s he built a self-balancing wheelchair so the disabled could be at eye level with anyone.\n\nEven as he worked on medical devices, Kamen pondered the future of urban transportation. He didn't see a place for automobiles in that future, and liked to say you don't need a 4,000-pound vehicle to move a 150-pound person one mile. After finishing the wheelchair, developing an entirely new mode of transportation was the obvious next step.\n\nDean Kamen rides the Segway PT. (Photo by Mark Peterson/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nKamen met Field in the mid-1990s when Field was working at Johnson & Johnson, one of Kamen's business partners. Kamen found himself struck by Field's intelligence.\n\nField, for his part, seemed destined to revolutionize transport. His mother wrote in his baby book that her son would one day work on stuff with wheels. Kamen's vision of moving people about on small, electric machines enticed Field, who had started his career developing vehicles at Ford. He found the challenge of developing self-balancing technology irresistible.\n\nAt Segway, Field earned a reputation as a brilliant engineer and calm leader who listened to everyone, didn't micromanage, and was beloved by all. \"You got the impression he was searching for perfection among leadership, team-building,\" said Jason Sachs, an early Segway employee. \"His character and manner made people trust him.\"\n\nThe world got its first glimpse of the Segway PT \u2014 Personal Transporter \u2014 on Good Morning America on December 3, 2001. It was, in a word, a sensation. Few products have enjoyed such hype. John Doerr, an early investor in Google and Amazon, predicted it would be bigger than the internet and that it would achieve $1 billion in revenue faster than any product in history.\n\nHype aside, the PT was an impressive gadget. Gyroscopes allowed it to balance perfectly on two wheels. Instead of using handlebars or a steering wheel, riders shifted their weight to turn. It marked the first consumer application of drive-by-wire technology, in which software, not mechanical linkages, makes a machine turn, accelerate, and stop. Riders zipped along at up to 12.5 mph for as much as 12 miles on a single charge.\n\nA Segway tour passes through Hanover, Germany. (Photo by Swen Pf\u00f6rtner/picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nThe PT was truly innovative, even revolutionary. Kamen, who had spent parts of about six years developing the PT, spoke seriously of rendering cars obsolete. His employees talked about working with urban planners in China to design new cities around their two-wheeled transport.\n\n\"There was a lot of reference to drinking the Kool-Aid,\" said early Segway employee Matt Gelbwaks. \"We're here to change the world. It's bigger than us. It's bigger than us individually, it's even bigger than us collectively.\"\n\nThings didn't quite work out that way. Although brilliantly designed and meticulously built, two significant drawbacks hobbled the PT: It cost $4,950 and it was hard to look like anything other than a nerd riding one. It became a punchline, and then a trope, as a prop in television shows like \"Arrested Development\" and movies like \"Mall Cop.\" It didn't help that guys like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak took to playing polo with them and that President George W. Bush fell off of one in 2003.\n\nFormer president George W.

The company sold them at a deep discount to roughly 100 residents. Within a year nearly all of the participants had stopped riding their Segways. Why?\n\n\"There was a significant dork factor,\" Gelbwaks says. \"It was never truly socially accepted.\"\n\nCash crunch\n\nThe experiment in Florida highlighted another problem: Segway developed and tested the PT under the greatest secrecy. The company worried a competitor might beat it to market, and suspected Japanese automakers were working on a similar device. Employees kept the shades drawn. In some cases, they sealed the blinds with tape, lest someone try to peek through the narrow gap between the blind and window frame. They hid the scooters in plywood crates before transporting them.\n\nBut working this way kept Segway from figuring out what people might want or need in a scooter.\n\n\"How do you do product testing if you can't go outside?\" said Jonathan Pompa, an early Segway engineer. \"It worked really well at driving around an engineering office, because that's what we were doing with it, instead of driving around in a city.\"\n\nKamen's singular focus on the PT created another problem: Although Segway built prototypes of electric bikes, four-wheelers, skateboards and even a unicycle \u2014 many of which Ninebot, its eventual owner, currently offers \u2014 it never commercialized them. It couldn't, because it didn't have the money.\n\nSegway struggled to bring the price of the PT down to a consumer-friendly $1,000. The cost of its nickel metal hydride battery made that impossible. Manufacturing in New Hampshire, rather than China, didn't help. Despite the company's best efforts, the PT remained frightfully expensive.\n\n\"Five or six grand for one of these things was crazy,\" said Klee Kleber, Segway's vice president of marketing from 2004-07. \"The price was way out of whack.\"\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos stands on a Segway PT with Dean Kamen and NASDAQ Vice Chairman David Weild, center, after opening the NASDAQ on Nov. 18, 2002, the same day the device went on sale to the public. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nYou won't get any argument from Jim Norrod, the company's CEO from 2005 until 2009.\n\n\"A lot of people said our products were too expensive, they were too high-priced. Yeah, they were,\" Norrod said. \"You know why? I needed the money to run the company.\"\n\nBeyond the exorbitant cost, the world was not ready for electric vehicles. Oh sure, there were plenty of wealthy techies for whom it was a fun toy, and Segway was able to experiment with rental programs and even to explore a partnership with Zipcar, the car-sharing outfit. But it lacked the infrastructure needed to truly transform transportation.\n\nPlus, buying one was a headache. The first customers had to travel to regional training centers for lessons. And once you bought one, there was no clear place to ride it. A lot of people didn't want them on sidewalks. Unlike the ride-hailing and scooter startups of today, the company spent years working within the system to win friends and change rules.\n\n\"Did we need to pass a law in Mississippi? Did we need to pass a law in North Dakota? No,\" said Matt Dailida, who led a nationwide push to make Segways on sidewalks legal. \"But it was a fundamental belief at the company's highest levels that we wanted to be engaging public officials and get their buy-in and excitement.\"\n\nNorrod was doing everything he could to rein in costs and keep Segway afloat when General Motors threw him a lifeline in 2007. The two companies started developing the EN-V, a pod-shaped lightweight electric vehicle concept that GM would unveil three years later at Expo 2010 in Shanghai.\n\nJust as things looked up, though, the financial crisis hit.\n\n\"I'm sitting there with no ability to bring money in,\" he said. \"Venture capitalists are basically cutting out their non-profitable businesses. The stock market craters. That's what I'm staring at and saying, 'what am I going to do?' I had to find any deal that was going to work.\"\n\nGM seemed like an obvious buyer. Together they could commercialize the EN-V and fulfill the long-delayed Segway vision of post-car urban transportation. GM's bankruptcy dashed those hopes. Instead, Norrod engineered a sale to Heselden, the British entrepreneur. When he died, Brown took over.\n\nWhen Segway met Ninebot\n\nIn 2014, Segway convinced the US International Trade Commission to investigate infringements of Segway's patents for its self-balancing technology. One of the companies listed in Segway's complaint was Ninebot, which quickly offered to buy the company.\n\nNinebot saw a company that shared its vision of improving urban transport. It also saw a company with tremendous brand recognition. And it knew it would need Segway's patents to enter the US market. The two sides quickly closed the deal, which was announced April 15, 2015.\n\nNinebot began almost immediately to sell a series of Segway branded scooters and other products priced at $1,000 or less. They've sold far faster than the Segway PT ever did, and were exactly the kind of affordable options Kleber, the former VP of marketing, envisioned.\n\n\"Segway now is sort of where I thought we should've been 10 years ago,\" Kleber said.\n\nThe golden age of electric transportation\n\nFifteen years after Kamen introduced the world to an electric vehicle, the world was finally ready for them. By 2017, the sharing and gig economies were in full swing, two things essential to the success of companies like Lime and Bird. People think nothing of sharing rather than owning things these days, and a ready supply of independent contractors makes charging and repairing scooters far easier \u2014 and cheaper. It also helped that smartphones, which make it a breeze to unlock a scooter and pay for a ride, are ubiquitous. And the ever-growing number of bike lanes in urban centers provides a place to ride safely.\n\nThe business attitude has shifted, too. Segway's attempts at working with cities gave way to a more aggressive attitude of barging into a city with a few hundred scooters, setting up shop, and dealing with city officials later. The tactic rarely wins friends in government, but has allowed Bird and Lime to grow rapidly.\n\n\"At Segway we tried to do it the right way, and it was a nightmare,\" Kleber said. \"So I kind of actually respect the fact that they're just blowing in and dumping the scooters in the street and letting it sort itself out.\"\n\nBird scooters rest on a sidewalk in San Diego. (Frank Duenzl/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images)\n\nScooter startups also follow the Silicon Valley ethos of iterate, iterate, iterate, which runs counter to Segway's perfectionism. The startups favor cheap scooters \u2014 they typically cost just a few hundred bucks \u2014 that were never designed for the rigors of heavy use and adverse weather. But why worry about such things when scooters are essentially commodities, easily replaced when they inevitably break or get thrown into trees, rivers, or San Francisco Bay? Bird, Lime, and all their competitors prefer to move fast, learn from mistakes, solicit customer feedback, and then introduce improvements like bigger batteries.\n\nAnyone standing on something that's powered by electricity and a computer is a Segway descendent. Doug Field, former Segway VP of design and engineering\n\nThe success of these companies draws mixed emotions from Segway veterans, but the most common feeling among the 20 former employees who spoke to CNN Business was excitement. Lightweight electric vehicles, long ridiculed as an expensive toy for nerds, are finally getting their due.\n\n\"I love it,\" Pompa said. \"It's a transportation niche that hasn't been properly addressed.\"\n\nYet some worry the current growth trajectory cannot continue, and that scooter startups run the risk of litigation and even financial ruin if they don't get serious about safety. People regularly ride without helmets (often in violation of local ordinances or state laws), zip through traffic or along sidewalks indiscriminately, and sometimes ride two-to-a-scooter. Two riders have died on the scooters this year.\n\n\"If you want to make this sustainable for a long time, significantly more thought should be put into this,\" said Stephan de Penasse, one of Segway's first employees. \"Everyone's in for a fast buck.\"\n\nSegway's delayed victory\n\nSegway's office in Bedford, New Hampshire, is a quiet place. It focuses on the Segway PT, and the market for it is shrinking, according to Ninebot. As a result, there were layoffs earlier this year. When CNN Business visited in September, an area once used for testing the Segway PT had given way to palettes of scooters fresh from China.\n\nMost of the R&D and manufacturing has moved to a bustling building outside Beijing. Still, employees feel a tremendous sense of pride in what they've accomplished.\n\n\"People like to say Segway was a flop, but we're still here,\" said Roxanne Lamonde, a 12-year-veteran of Segway and its director of risk management and human resources. \"There aren't many startups that started when we did and are still around.\"\n\nMany employees believe the popularity of scooters and success of companies like Lime and Bird vindicates Kamen's vision of personalized, electric transportation. \"If Segway was a piece of leading to that vision of getting around congested cities easier, I guess I'm pretty proud of that,\" former employee Chip MacDonald said. \"I just wish I could've been able to profit from it.\"\n\nAs for Kamen, he believes the scooter boom confirms his ideas about the future of transportation. But he isn't terribly interested in talking about it, and wonders why the media would be. He considers the Segway a footnote to his career, something of far less import than the advances he pioneered in insulin pumps and dialysis machines, or the students he's encouraged, through his nonprofit FIRST, to pursue engineering.\n\nThese days, Kamen is far more excited about his latest venture, the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute, which explores ways of regenerating human organs. He mentions this to me as he is driving home from a speech in Boston, where he'd gone to recruit employees (he's hired 60 engineers in the past two months alone). As usual, he was introduced to the audience as the inventor of the Segway.\n\n\"It's been 20 years,\" he said. \"No matter what else I do in life, I'm the Segway guy.\"\n\nPeople usually praise the Segway and Kamen's efforts to remake transportation. But occasionally someone will ask if Kamen considers it a failure. When that happens, he often thinks of the Wright Brothers.\n\n\"They certainly weren't giving out frequent flyer miles by 1920,\" he said. \"But I don't think anybody would say, 'Hey Wilbur hey Orville, how do you feel about that failure?'\"\n\nAnd in the emerging world of micromobility, a catch-all term for small, computerized electric vehicles, Kamen is a visionary with a place in history.\n\n\"A lot of people laughed at him when the Segway was released or failed,\" said Sanjay Dastoor, CEO of Skip, a scooter-sharing company. \"I always thought it was a shame for that to be people's first reaction. He had an amazing career, and really, Dean was right.\"",

However, some environmental groups have hit back -- arguing the airport construction has caused mass deforestation\n\nThe total project area is 76.5 million square meters. Courtesy Istanbul New Airport\n\nThere have also been accusations of poor working conditions and workers dying on site. Turkey's Ministry of Labor has blamed \"health problems and traffic accidents\" for 27 worker fatalities on site, according to reports.\n\nThe total cost of the project is roughly $12 billion.

Courtesy Istanbul New Airport\n\nCNN Travel asked three European aviation experts to weigh in on how Istanbul's new airport might impact the transport world.\n\n'The project is unprecedented'\n\n\"From an airport planning perspective, the project is unprecedented, both in terms of its size (the eventual plan is for the airport to accommodate 200 million passengers, which is nearly double the size of the current largest airport in the world, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) and, in particular, the speed with which the project was attempted.\n\nTo complete an airport project of this size in just three and a half years was extremely challenging, not least in terms of ensuring timely operational readiness of all related facilities, systems, procedures and equipment needed to run the airport (Berlin's Brandenburg Airport provides a stark example of what can go wrong with a new airport project like this).\n\nPolitically, it is important for Turkey, President Erdogan, and his party, opening on the 95th anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish Republic. Building a new airport is inevitably a vastly expensive undertaking (reportedly around $12 billion), and there have been concerns around the coincidence of this with a general downturn in the Turkish economy. There have also been ethical concerns raised about labor practices involving the thousands of workers needed to the complete the project on time.\n\nWhile there will likely be challenges ahead, there are several factors acting in the airports favor, including the relatively strong existing domestic air transport market in Turkey (which rivals in the Middle East generally do not have to the same extent), and the fact that the airport is less likely to face the same degree of potentially constraining environmental legislation, which is generally the case for large airports in Western Europe.\n\nRegardless, the airport will certainly have an impact (one way or another) for air transport both within the region and globally.\" --\n\nDr Thomas Budd, Lecturer in Airport Planning and Management, Centre for Air Transport Management, Cranfield University, UK\n\nRelated content How Asia's airports are changing the way we travel\n\n'Aviation demand in Turkey is growing rapidly'\n\nPlanes on the tarmac at Istanbul Airport on October 29, ahead of the inauguration. Burak Kara/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n\"The new airport is taking over from Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport, which is already in the world's top 20 busiest airports. So effectively it's the same situation as if Atat\u00fcrk (which is a congested airport with sometimes significant delays) was expanded. It's quite unusual to see a large airport expansion in Europe but much more in line with recent significant capacity expansions in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nProjected growth rates in aviation demand between Europe and and the Middle East/Asia are very high (for example Boeing projects demand in 20 years' time between Europe and the Middle East to be 2.6 times what it is at present in terms of passenger-km, and 3 times for trips from Europe to China). So the new airport is trying to act as a hub for some of that traffic as well as serving increases in demand to and from Turkey (the Turkish aviation system has grown rapidly in recent years). In doing so it's competing with other large hub airports in the Middle East and Europe for long-distance passengers.\n\nIn the short term the main impact will be smaller delays for passengers traveling to, from and via Istanbul and greater flexibility for airlines using the airport, which may in turn mean some increases in overall passenger demand. Longer term, the outcome is more difficult to predict. But capacity expansion is typically constrained in European airports and much less so for Middle Eastern airports, so we might see some European airport transfer passenger traffic switch to Istanbul.\n\nAs to whether the airport will become one of the world's busiest: given that it is taking over all of the traffic from an existing airport that is already one of the world's busiest, this seems very likely. Aviation demand in Turkey is growing rapidly and long-distance passenger demand which could use Istanbul as a transfer airport is also growing rapidly. So I would be very surprised if it was not (barring war, civil unrest, etc.).\"\n\nDr Lynnette Dray, Senior Research Associate, Bartlett School Env, Energy & Resources, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College, London\n\n'It will directly compete with the current hub airports in the Middle East'\n\nThe terminal of the new Istanbul Airport, with a banner featuring Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Burak Kara/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n\"I think that the primary thought behind the new airport is that it will directly compete with the current hub airports in the Middle East such as in Doha and Dubai. I think it's got a very, very good chance of taking market share off them when it comes to single-stop itineraries that go from Asia to Europe and Europe to Asia. But also I think Istanbul is generally better situated. It can also act as a hub to some parts of Africa and indeed the current airport that's there, Atat\u00fcrk, already does.\n\nSo direct flight is increasingly popular and of course a hub airport would have to compete with long-distance direct flights. So I think that might be an issue. And also the fact that this airport's being relocated about 50 kilometers north of the city or north of the current airport means that, I would suspect, there might be a slightly subdued demand for flights to and from Istanbul itself. And also there might be competition from the other airport in Istanbul, Sabiha Gokcen, which is going to end up being slightly closer to the population centers.\n\nI can't see it struggling for passengers, given that the current airport that it's replacing has something like 63 million a year and I'd imagine most of those will transfer to the new airport. So that's already a substantial number of passengers that it's kind of inheriting off the back of the reputation of the previous airport. I would imagine that -- should they operationally run smoothly, so in other words should they have low connecting time, should they implement decent transport connections to the center of Istanbul -- then I can't see why they couldn't hit some of their targets pretty quickly.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Ever dreamed of tying the knot in a fairytale castle in Italy ? You can now rent one for just over $100 -- and the whole place will be exclusively yours.\n\nRoccascalegna, a medieval hamlet in the central, wild Abruzzo region, is leasing its stunning fortress for weddings, cocktail parties, birthdays, anniversaries and other once-in-a-lifetime events for a giveaway price.\n\nMayor Domenico Giangiordano is hoping to use the recently refurbished castle to liven up his depopulating town and turn it into a \u20ac100-a-time (about $114) niche location for lavish celebrations.\n\n\"It's a real low fee, practically a tip,\" Giangiordano tells CNN Travel , admiring the view stretching from the snowy peaks of the Apennine Mountains to the distant blue of the Adriatic sea. \"Our goal isn't to raise cash but to use this unique setting to revamp the local economy by luring an elite clientele who loves tiny, offbeat spots.\"\n\nRelated content Your own Italian home for $1? You can buy it in Ollolai\n\nKnown as the Castle in the Sky, the 700-square-meter venue features a chapel for weddings, a tower to host evening cocktail bashes and former dungeons and torture rooms for candlelit dinners and business brunches.\n\nRoccascalegna is a peaceful haven. Comune Roccascalegna\n\nSpotlights illuminate the uphill, craggy stone steps and inner gardens. The battlements have protruding iron balconies, glass floors and slit windows that overlook a verdant canyon -- an idyllic background for sunset photo sessions.\n\nThis is no ordinary Italian hilltop hamlet.\n\nRoccascalegna's castle shoots out of a shard-like horizontal basalt cliff. The rocky outcrop sits between flower meadows dotted with olive trees and barns.\n\nIt's a peaceful slice of heaven.\n\nIn the quaint village below, where peculiar purple fig trees and tiny pomegranate bushes sprout from massive rocks lining the streets, you're more likely to come across strutting hens than people.\n\nPirate invasions\n\nRoccascalegna's sleepiness belies a troubled past. Over the centuries it's fallen prey to barbarian invasions, enemy troops and pirate incursions from the coast.\n\nThe area was ominously known as Death Valley. Now it's seeking redemption.\n\n\"The castle, abandoned for ages, was a ruin where sheep and dogs slept,\" says Giangiordano. \"Look at it now -- it's a gem.\"\n\nDespite the area's beauty, Roccascalegna hasn't attracted the attention of the tourists populating other parts of Italy in their hundreds of thousands.\n\nRelated content Where to see Europe's best hilltop towns\n\nThere are just a few bars and B&Bs. Old stone cottages have been given a makeover while a few crumbling ones are on the market at \u20ac20,000 (about $22,000).\n\nThe overhanging castle can be reached by foot only, which makes the venue even more exclusive.\n\nRoccascalegna is surrounded by meadows and olive groves. Comune Roccascalegna\n\nThere are no roads leading there. Cars are parked at the entrance of the village and guests need to climb old donkey trails made of rough stones carved from the hill's jagged rocks.\n\nTo facilitate access the mayor is offering to help as wedding planner. There's also transport and logistics assistance with public minivans placed at guests' disposal.\n\nGiangiordano can also coordinate catering services with premium local products. Guests should prepare to have their waistlines destroyed -- the rustic local food is delicious but high in calories.\n\nNo high heels\n\nA local grandmother makes traditional wedding cakes. Silvia Marchetti\n\nSpecialties on the party menu include pallotte cace e ova (meat balls with grated Pecorino sheep cheese and eggs), Pizza Scima, (a white wine and olive oil flat bread), arrosticini lamb skewers, fiadone ricotta cheese pie and crespelle sweet-and-sour waffles.\n\nPane porchettato, a large bread dough stuffed with boneless pork roast, is a recipe patented by a grandmother who runs the village bakery.\n\nShe also makes traditional local wedding cakes such as taralli, huge sugar-powdered biscuits shaped like a princess crown that are gifted to the bride and guests.\n\nIf there's a catch, it's the dress code limitations. The hike to the castle can be tough and brides would struggle to make it to the altar in a long-train wedding gown.\n\nA stone staircase is the only way to reach the castle. Silvia Marchetti\n\nTrekking or running shoes are highly recommended. Barefoot, even better. Even donkey hooves have been known to get stuck in between the rock steps.\n\n\"One couple couldn't stop laughing,\" says Marcello Giangiordano, the castle's keeper and guide and no relation to the mayor. \"The bride was wearing a long silk pink dress and peep-toe stilettos. The groom, barefoot, swept her up in his arms and carried her all the way up to the altar.\"\n\nThose who make the climb are rewarded by breathtaking views and lungfuls of clean air.\n\nHeadless ghost\n\nRock arches lead to the banqueting hall, a former cellar where armies stacked food during sieges. Inside the prison tower, lights shine in former medieval toilet seats.\n\nFinger foods are served in spooky rooms showcasing torture objects. The underground dungeons are shaped like Dante's Inferno: the nastier the crime, the deeper the cell.\n\nRelated content 10 things Italy does better than anywhere else\n\nThe venue comes with its own guest. It's said to be haunted by the headless ghost of Baron Corvo de Corvis, who enforced the evil medieval right of sleeping with all newlywed village girls until an angry husband stabbed him to death.\n\nFor centuries the baron's bloody hand print stained the castle walls.

But really it's the crab -- kani, in Japanese -- that's most sought after.\n\nThere are several seasonal varieties of crab, all of which are available in the countless restaurants and market stands across Hokkaido's capital, Sapporo.\n\n\"The Sea of Okhotsk is a cold water sea, bringing some of the world's richest fishing waters north from the Aleutian Islands and Kamchatka down to Hokkaido,\" says Ido Gabay, founder of Hokkaido Nature Tours , which offers gourmet food journeys through Sapporo and beyond.\n\n\"The plankton-filled waters are perfect for the bottom-dwelling crabs.\"\n\nThese include kegani (hairy crab), known for its delicate, sweet flesh. And then there's zuwaigani (snow crab), only harvested in winter.\n\nMeanwhile, tarabagan is the largest type of king crab. It's in season from September to January.\n\nAnd finally there's also hanasaki, which is especially famed for its roe and traditionally served from late summer to mid-Autumn.\n\nThere are many ways to enjoy Hokkaido's crustaceans, but Gabay says true gourmands seek out crab sashimi.\n\n\"Only master chefs can prepare the dish as it requires painstaking preparation to make the meat tender enough to enjoy,\" he says.\n\n\"The hundreds of precise cuts requires perfect concentration, and nearly an hour to prepare. Most chefs will not attempt to prepare the dish as it can easily leave diners unsatisfied with chewy, unforgiving texture.\n\n\"However, the master chef knows the correct strength and number of strokes to cut into the crab's flesh. Although the meat itself has a completely different flavor than grilled or boiled crab, the experience of eating crab sashimi in Hokkaido, and at other locations in Japan, is almost unique in the world.\"\n\nReady to kick off your own crab fest? Here are seven of the best spots to enjoy crab in Sapporo.\n\nSapporo Jyogai Ichiba\n\nThe \"Curb Market\" sits on the periphery of the city's Central Wholesale Market. JNTO\n\nIt may not look like much from the outside, but the closer you get, the more you realize you're approaching something nearing food nirvana.\n\nThat's because some of the freshest and best crab in Sapporo is served in the outdoor stalls of Jyogai Ichiba, or \"Curb Market,\" which lines the street outside the Sapporo Central Wholesale Market.\n\nThe market covers more than 80,000 square meters, so you can understand how every year it handles more than half a million tons of produce including seafood, fruit and vegetables.\n\nJapanese and international visitors are lured by dozens of purveyors offering sushi, sashimi and especially donburi rice bowls topped with sweet and succulent crab, salmon roe and umami-rich sea urchin.\n\nYou can also stock up on seafood to take home and many places will help you pack and ship it, if you're not carrying it back yourself.\n\nJyogai Ichiba , 2-3 North 11, West 21, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido\n\nNijo Market\n\nIt doesn't get much fresher than this. Chris Dwyer\n\nAnother market, but this one is smaller and older.\n\nNijo is slightly more central than the wholesale market, meaning it attracts more tourists, but the quality of the seafood and crab is just as good as at its bigger counterpart.\n\nAs with pretty much any market, the earlier you get there, the better. To find the ultimate seafood breakfast of champions, the only challenge comes in choosing a stall or traditional restaurant.\n\nWhile you really can't go wrong wherever you choose, Sushidokoro Keiran is a good bet thanks to more than 80 years in the business and having staff who also speak English and Chinese.\n\nLocated near the market's east entrance, you can choose to sit at a table or the counter where you can watch the chef craft dishes including picture-perfect kaisen donburi, those rice bowls heaped with tarabagani king crab meat and other ocean-fresh delights.\n\nAfterward, it's worth perusing the market stalls or grabbing a coffee at one of the eclectic caf\u00e9s close by.\n\nSushidokoro Keiran , 2-9 Minami 3-jo Higashi, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-0053, Hokkaido\n\nSapporo Kanihonke\n\nHioki Tatsuo is known as \"the father of crab cuisine\" not only in Hokkaido, but all of Japan.\n\nIn a country obsessed by the quality of its seafood, that's some claim.\n\nThen again, he founded Sapporo Kanihonke more than half a century ago, so it's safe to say few are as experienced when it comes to top-notch crustaceans.\n\nThere are 14 branches around the country, with two in Sapporo -- one bang opposite the main railway station the other near the Susukino subway stop.\n\nYou won't miss them, thanks to the huge crab suspended above the entrance, while inside the elegant interiors feature wooden beams, rock gardens and traditional Japanese crafts on show.\n\nRelated content 7 tours that offer an authentic look at Tokyo and beyond\n\nOn the menu, standouts include crab sashimi and sushi. Many visitors come for their crab hotpot dishes, either kanishabu served without the shell, or kanisuki, served with.\n\nAnother favorite is crab marino, where crab meat and fat are rolled in sticky rice, deep fried and then served in umami-rich broth.\n\nKita no Gourmet Tei\n\nThis restaurant sits inside a food store, itself located inside the wholesale market. Handily a number of hotels offer free shuttles to get here.\n\nOn walking in, you'll see a wall of autographs and photos from celebrities, showing the acclaim and reputation in which the place has been held since it opened more than 50 years ago.\n\nRelated content End of an era as Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market closes\n\nIn common with the rest of Sapporo, the prices for world-class seafood are remarkably moderate, while of course the crab doesn't get fresher.\n\nTheir specialties include huge botan shrimp, fatty, decadent slices of o-toro tuna, but most of all king crab charred over open flame, barbecue style.\n\nKaiyotei Susukino\n\nKaiyotei Susukino: Famous for its crab croquettes. Courtesy of Kaiyotei Susukino\n\nCrab croquettes are the dish to order in this compact basement restaurant. They pride themselves on the freshness of the crab and the quality of the crispy croquette, which keep regulars and visitors alike coming back for more.\n\nThey make a simple white sauce using flour and local Hokkaido milk -- which is also famed for its quality -- before incorporating hugely generous chunks of fresh crab and frying to a crunchy golden brown exterior.\n\nInside, a sensational creamy mix awaits, lifted by a squeeze of lemon if required. Locals and visitors alike often come to get take-out orders of this decadent and delicious treat. We can well understand why.\n\nKaiyotei Susukino , White Building B1F5-27, 4 Shinjuku-dori, chome South 6th west, Chuo-ku, Sapporo\n\nHyousetsu no Mon\n\nAnother spot that's been in business for more than half a century, Hyousetsu no Mon opened back in 1964 and to this day serves up a wide range of crab dishes including tempura, sushi and shabu-shabu -- hotpot.\n\nYou can choose the type of crab you wish to eat, while their steamed rice with crab is rightly famous. Called kanimeshi, the simple but delicious combo has crab added during the cooking, then more is added on top before serving.\n\nRelated content The world's 50 best foods\n\nThere are multiple set menu options, depending on budget and hunger levels. The elegant, high-ceilinged interiors make for a dining experience a step above some of Sapporo's more humble crab destinations.\n\nHyousetsu no Mon , 2 Chome Minami 5 Jonishi, Chuo Ward, Sapporo, Hokkaido; 064-0805\n\nKatsukani no Hanasaki\n\nFinally to another restaurant with an impressive reputation and also a Michelin star for its cuisine -- meaning that reservations are always necessary, even if it is open every day of the week.\n\nExecutive chef Kenyuu Oochi promises diners \"a memorable five sensory experience around a long communal table that encourages interaction with your fellow diners.\" A private dining room is available for small groups.\n\nThe menu may start with oysters, shrimp and the somewhat acquired taste and texture of the delicacy known as sea cucumber -- an ocean-dwelling echinoderm, not a vegetable.\n\nThen comes the parade of world-class crab prepared in multiple ways including sashimi, grilled and boiled.\n\nAn impressive wine and sake collection adds to the gastronomic experience.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Taking myself out to a local Japanese restaurant for dinner shouldn't have been a big deal, but it became one before I even picked up my chopsticks.\n\n\"Table for one,\" I said to the hostess, who didn't return my smile.\n\n\"Just one?\" she asked.\n\nIt wasn't the first time I'd heard that question which, five months into widowhood, was beginning to grate. I wondered what could be so challenging about such a simple request.\n\nAbout midway to my table, she stopped: \"Only yourself?\"\n\nAt that point, I lost it a little bit.\n\nI told her this was the third time I was stating the number of people at my table, which would have been two, had my husband been alive and with me.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be mean,\" she said. \"I just have to make sure.\"\n\nWhy some women won't eat out alone\n\nTo be sure of what? In that moment, I understood why so many women I know won't eat out alone. Nobody wants to be thrown back to being the shy kid in the school cafeteria who can't find a place to sit.\n\nIronically, I'm used to feeling right at home in restaurants.\n\nFor 25 years, I was a food critic for \"Newsday,\" a major suburban New York newspaper, and I dined out at least five times a week.\n\nWhile working on a story or review, it never bothered me to eat out by myself, but that was mainly at lunchtime. For evening visits to restaurants, I went out with my husband and, often, another couple. I couldn't order all the dishes I needed to try by myself. Our friends' presence made it easier to try everything and stay undercover.\n\nI can see now that I was living in a \"couple bubble.\"\n\nI still want to eat out\n\nNowadays, I work as an independent restaurant consultant. On and off the job, I usually dine out with friends, both couples and singles. Nevertheless, I still want to be able to treat myself to a nice dinner out in my own company.\n\nOther solo diners -- a sizable contingent of America's restaurant-going population -- seem to be avoiding the kind of situation I found myself in. Many prefer places where they can order at the counter and seat themselves.\n\nSolo dining occasions comprise 27% of the total at fast casual restaurants -- places such as Panera Bread or Chipotle, according to a 2016 study of restaurant visits by The Hartman Group, a Seattle-based market research organization.\n\nAt coffee shops, solo occasions comprise about half the total, while at fast casual restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King, they make up about 38% of the total. But full-service restaurants reported that the number of solo dining occasions was too insignificant to quantify.\n\nWhat does this say?\n\n\"Dinner occasions tend to be more social (with others) and more indulgent, so that's where full service-type restaurants fit in,\" said Hartman Group senior director of marketing Blaine Becker.\n\nMaybe that's not true for everyone. While they might make up a small minority, people who like to treat themselves to a fine dining experience solo do exist.\n\nWomen eat out alone, sometimes\n\nWendy Richman, a freelance violist and adjunct professor of music at New York University, feels just fine indulging alone at full service restaurants, such as Vietnaam on the Upper East Side and Sushi Yasaka on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nHer comfort level at fine dining establishments varies with geography.\n\n\"In a lot of big cities, people don't even look twice when you're eating by yourself,\" she said. \"I eat out alone the most in New York because it feels like the easiest culture. In the South, I do it less because I get looked at a little more.\"\n\nRichman, who prefers a proper table to a seat at the bar, has also run up against the \"just one\" question, which she calls a micro-aggression. \"I want to be defensive, but instead I stand up taller and say yes, just me.\"\n\nHow to treat solo diners\n\nNobody is questioning solo diners at Brooklyn's Krupa Grocery in the Windsor Terrace neighborhood, which was recently named one of the top eight restaurants in the borough for dining alone by Brooklyn Magazine. Co-owner/manager Thomas Sperduto said his restaurant doesn't treat singles differently than other diners.\n\n\"We just seat them,\" he said, noting that he asks where they'd prefer, at the bar or at a table. \"Then I always make sure we de-set the table. It's awkward to leave a place setting when there's not going to be another person.\"\n\nIn the Long Island suburbs, a relatively short distance from Brooklyn, another kind of dining scene is dominated by couples and families. Single diners are a minority.\n\nWomen can face hassles\n\nWhile chef-restaurateur Tom Schaudel has trained his staff to be sensitive to single diners, most eating solo at his restaurants (Jewel in Melville, aMano in Mattituck, A Lure in Southold and Kingfish in Westbury) opt to sit at the bar, he said.\n\nSchaudel estimates the ratio of men to women at about 65% to 35%. He observes, though, that it's not always easy for women. \"I've seen women eat at the bar and men making them feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nRelated content How single-parent families are changing the way we travel\n\nOverall, then, do men have fewer hassles eating out by themselves?\n\nJohn Martillo, an aerospace engineer in Los Angeles, believes so. Martillo, who often takes himself out to eat when away on business, doesn't recall ever having been questioned.\n\nRather than feeling uncomfortable alone, Martillo relishes the time, always opting for a table. \"I'll bring a book, sit down, enjoy a nice steak, read and people-watch. I enjoy the heck out of it.\"\n\nWe all want to be able to enjoy the heck out of eating alone -- to sit at a good table and scope out the scene, focus on what's on the plate and feel free to not converse with anyone.\n\nSo what's stopping us? Are restaurateurs afraid of giving up seating to someone whose check will, naturally, be smaller than the one at a table for two?\n\nRelated content Solo travelers to Maldives have plenty to see and do\n\nA satisfied solo diner may have friends\n\nThe truth is that most restaurant personnel aren't even aware the \"just one\" question might offend anyone. They should be told.\n\nAs a restaurant consultant, my professional advice to those who own eating establishments is to train your staff to treat solo diners with care and sensitivity. Anyone whose job it is to seat guests should show singles to the best tables available -- and do so cheerfully and unquestioningly.\n\nThis is not only the right way to behave; it also shows savvy business sense. After all, a satisfied solo diner may show up a week later with a friend or two. Or four. Or even six.",

    "text": "St Louis, Missouri (CNN) \u2014 Smoking or nonsmoking? One bed or two? Street view or garden view? When it comes to choosing a hotel room, some people let their hearts make the decision.\n\nThe Angad Arts Hotel, which opened in St. Louis, Missouri , in November 2018, has rooms in four different colors. But rather than assigning them at random, each guest is encouraged to choose a room that best matches their emotions.\n\nThe four options are red (passion), green (rejuvenation), yellow (happiness) and blue (tranquility).\n\nAnd the color plays a bigger role than just determining the paint on the walls. There are little and big touches everywhere, from throw pillows to the rubber duckies in the bathroom.\n\nEntering the almost neon-yellow room, where everything is drenched in the color -- including pipes on the ceiling -- feels a little bit like walking into a Van Gogh painting.\n\nA two-bed blue room at the Angad. Alise O'Brien/Angad Arts Hotel\n\nThe hotel's name has several meanings.\n\nFirst, Angad. One of the hotel's investors, Lord Paul, had a son named Angad who passed away in 2015, so the name is a memorial to him.\n\nBut the hotel has also retrofitted the name into an acronym for their five pillars of service -- Anticipation, Nurturing, Graciousness, Apology and Details.\n\nRelated content Hot new hotels to check into in 2018\n\nAs for the second word in the name, Arts, it's fair considering the hotel's location.\n\nThe Angad's location is within easy walking distance of several of the city of St Louis' premier arts and culture destinations , including the Contemporary Arts Museum, the historic Fox Theatre with its ornate \"neo-Byzantine\" decor and the Firebird live music venue.\n\nEven the building itself has a rich arts history -- it was originally built in the 1920s as a theater. Because the building is on the National Register of Historic Places, renovation and conversion had to be respectful.\n\nYou won't be starved for food and drink options in the area -- you can also walk over to lines-down-the-block barbecue spot Pappy's Smokehouse and celebrated brewery Urban Chestnut.\n\nAfter $380 million in renovations, Missouri's famous landmark is even more welcoming to visitors with an event space, bike trails and a new museum.\n\nThere's still one major unanswered question, though -- what if you arrive feeling passionate red, but leave feeling tranquil blue? That may be due to the power of color, but it may also just be the power of a much-needed break.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Travelers hoping to experience one of the oldest luxury hotels in Bangkok will want to book their flights ASAP.\n\nThe Dusit Thani Bangkok, a city icon famed for its striking modernist architecture, is closing its doors in early 2019.\n\nIt will be torn down to make way for a mixed-use project that will include a rebuilt version of the hotel.\n\nThough the new Dusit Thani will undoubtedly be spectacular, nostalgic locals are sad to see the original go. They're using these final months as a chance for one last visit.\n\n\"So many Thais, as well as expats, have told me how many memories they have of the hotel,\" says Titiya Chooto, Dusit VP of operations and general manager of Dusit Thani.\n\n\"As part of the transition into the new chapter we're now showcasing what we've been legendary for. The graciousness, the beauty of the building, the architecture, the people side, the product side -- every single bit of it. It's a lot to be proud of.\"\n\nl e v a r t\n\nWhen Dusit Thani's familiar edifice disappears next year, it will forever change the skyline in one of the busiest parts of the city -- a view many Bangkok residents have grown up with.\n\nSitting on a corner of prime land at the Rama IV and Silom Road junction across from Lumpini Park, the Dusit Thani first opened its doors in 1970.\n\nAt the time, it was Bangkok's tallest and most luxurious hotel, earning a reputation among the trave l set for its attention to detail.\n\nDesigned by Japanese architect Yozo Shibata and inspired by Bangkok's Temple of Dawn, it represented a new era for the Thai capital and quickly became a hotspot on the dining and event scene, its function rooms hosting many weddings of the rich and famous.\n\nA section of wall on the mezzanine floor is covered in faded black and white photos of the recognizable names and faces who have stayed in its suites over the years, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Whitney Houston, Ronald Reagan and Tom Jones.\n\nRelated content In a remote corner of Thailand, tree pod dining and luxury villas await\n\nClassic Thai designs\n\nA recent stay revealed a property full of warmth, charm and traditional Thai decor so many travelers once eagerly sought out -- that means plenty of teakwood, classical Siamese art works and fine silks.\n\nThe Dusit Thani has 517 rooms and suites, which feature a variety of themes and decor. Basic guestrooms offer more subtle Thai influences, while decor in the higher end options, like the Ratanakosin Suite, are inspired by Thailand's historical eras.\n\nEven if you're not staying at the hotel, it's worth dropping by for a drink or a meal. (And be sure to visit the hotel's funky octagonal pool, which wouldn't look out of place in a campy 1970s film.)\n\nThe hotel offers six dining options, including Benjarong (contemporary Thai), The Mayflower (Cantonese) and Vietnamese eatery Thien Duong.\n\nIn need of a red meat fix?

    "text": "(CNN) The rate of female genital mutilation, or cutting, in young girls has seen a \"huge and significant decline\" across most parts of Africa over nearly three decades, according to a new analysis.\n\nThe fastest drop has been in East Africa, says the report, published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal . There, prevalence among girls up to 14 years old dropped from 71.4% in 1995 to 8% in 2016.\n\nTraditionally, rates have been high in East African nations, such as Somalia , where 98% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 have been cut, according to UN figures.\n\nThe decline has been \"much slower\" in West and North Africa but is still significant, said the report's authors, a team of UK and South African researchers led by Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala, professor of biostatistics at Britain's Northumbria University.\n\nIn North Africa, the percentage of girls undergoing FGM dropped from 57.7% to 14.1% between 1990 and 2015, according to the report. Meanwhile, in West Africa, the prevalence of the practice fell from 73.6% in 1996 to 25.4% in 2017.\n\nIn two countries in the Middle East covered by the data, Iraq and Yemen, the rate of FGM has actually increased since 1997, the report said.\n\nThe report drew on data gathered between 1990 and 2017 covering nearly 210,000 girls from 14 up, from 29 countries.\n\n\"There is evidence of huge and significant decline in the prevalence of FGM/C among children across countries and regions,\" the report's authors wrote.\n\n\"There is a need to sustain comprehensive intervention efforts. In addition, further targeted, culturally sensitive policy interventions and other effective strategies for preventing FGM/C should be a major public health priority in countries and regions still showing high prevalence of FGM/C among children, where the practice is still pervasive.\"\n\nFemale genital mutilation involves the altering or removing of the female genitals, such as the clitoris or labia. The procedure can cause severe bleeding and health issues including infections and infertility, as well as complications in childbirth.\n\nAccording to United Nations statistics , at least 200 million girls and women across 30 countries are today affected by the practice, which is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women.\n\nThe report's authors note that while the significant overall decline points toward the success of national and international investment and intervention over the past three decades, certain risk factors still prevail and could lead to a reversal in the trend in some countries.\n\n\"These risk factors include lack of, or poor education, poverty and continued perception of FGM/C as a potential marriage market activity,\" the report said.\n\nThe study is, however, observational and survey data relied on personal contributions often affected by illiteracy, poverty and cultural sensitivities, the report points out.\n\nFurther efforts are needed if the goal of eliminating the practice completely is to be reached, it said, including through legislation, advocacy and education.\n\nPartnerships with religious and community leaders, young people and health workers may be needed to come up with \"more culturally-sensitive and community-engaging strategies\" to drive the practice downward, the authors suggest.\n\nThe report notes that while female genital mutilation is most prevalent in Africa and some Middle Eastern regions, research shows that the practice also exists elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. It is reported in Europe, North and South America too, particularly as a result of migration.",

    "text": "Moshi, Tanzania \u2014 Every month when payday came around, Suzana Frederick purchased a packet of sanitary pads. It was the first thing she bought. And when her period started, she knew she was ready for it.\n\nThe 19-year-old single mother from Arusha, Tanzania, was making 30,000 shillings ($13) a month as a housekeeper and would spend between 1,500 and 3,000 shillings ($0.70 to $1.30) on pads -- a staggering 5% to 10% of her salary.\n\nFor an American woman making a typical wage, that would be the equivalent of between $169 and $338 for just one pack of sanitary pads.\n\nThe steep price was worth it for Frederick. The alternative of missing a few days of work each month to manage her period at home would have been more costly.\n\nRoughly 1.8 billion people around the world menstruate. Some can't afford sanitary products. Others have nowhere to buy them. And even if price isn't an issue, stigma and taboo still stop many from fully participating in work and school during their periods.\n\nFor these women, the cost of menstruation is missing out on life.\n\nGirls use fabric and rugs, but dream of pads\n\nIn rural Tanzania, most women and girls on their period use \"kanga,\" layered pieces of thick, colorful fabric used for making traditional east African dresses.\n\nThe stiff material gets wet quickly and often leads to urinary tract infections. Girls and women say they live in constant fear of bleeding through.\n\n\"I put [it] on in the morning, it will be wet with blood at 10 a.m. and start showing on my skirt,\" says Esuvati Tisanai Shaushi, a 15-year-old Maasai girl who lives in a village near Arusha. Her school, like many in Tanzania, doesn't have toilets with running water to wash.\n\n\"I feel ashamed... [I] keep on wondering how it will be [what will happen] in class.\"\n\nAmong young girls in Tanzania, the gold standard of sanitary pads is Procter & Gamble's brand Always.\n\nTisanai Shaushi has used them only once, when she was given a sample at school.\n\n\"I was so happy,\" she said. \"When I removed it, my pants were clean. It was comfortable.\"\n\nBut when she asked her mother to buy the pads for her, the answer was no.\n\n\"She told me to use kanga because she uses them too,\" Tisanai Shaushi said. When she pressed the issue, her mother told her she could buy them when she got her own money.\n\nProcter and Gamble (P&G) has invested heavily in educational campaigns in East Africa, including in Tanzania. Among other initiatives, it provides samples and starter packs to schools. But once the samples run out, the girls often go back to using kanga. Always pads are not widely available, and when they are they're more expensive than other products.\n\nJennifer Davis, the global head of feminine care at P&G, told CNN the cost reflects the quality: \"The foundation of our portfolio globally is always superior protection.\"\n\nP&G doesn't break down its revenues from its different products. But Euromonitor International, a market research company, estimated P&G made $6.2 billion selling feminine care products in 2017 -- more than any other company.\n\nDavis declined to say how much P&G makes per pack, but said it is trying to keep pads as affordable as possible.\n\nHowever, Always pads remain unaffordable for many Tanzanian girls.\n\nJennifer Rubli from Femme International , a menstrual health NGO in Tanzania, says P&G has done a great job marketing its products.\n\n\"Girls don't talk about wanting disposable pads. They want Always,\" Rubli said.\n\nOther cheaper sanitary products are available in Tanzania, but the selection is limited.\n\nChinese-made pads -- perfumed with menthol and aloe vera \"flavors\" -- are typically slightly less expensive and more widely available in Tanzania, but several women and girls who spoke with CNN complained of \"burning\" and \"itching.\"\n\n\"I used pads only once, and I felt a burning sensation. After using it for six hours and changing it, I was burning,\" one woman, Yuster Venance Kimaryo, a 37-year-old fruit trader in Moshi said. \"That's when I stopped using it.\"\n\nPeriod absenteeism\n\nThere are no global statistics on how many girls miss school because of their periods, but anecdotal evidence shows that period absenteeism is common across much of the developing world.\n\nIn Tanzania, 16% of girls say their periods keep them out of school, research by the Tanzania Water and Sanitation Network found.\n\nDuring a recent school day, Violeth Hugolin Msophe, a pupil at Ghona Secondary School in Moshi, near Kilimanjaro, bled through her kanga and all over her dark green skirt. She wrapped her sweater tightly around her waist, asked a teacher for permission to leave and walked two hours home.\n\nMartha Msangi Goodwine, the teacher who's in charge of girls' welfare at the school, said this happens so often that teachers sometimes buy pads just to have them on hand -- but they can't afford to supply the whole school.\n\n\"Many children here come from villages and very few are able to buy pads in the shops,\" she said.\n\nWhen non-profit organization Femme International gave each girl at Ghona a pack of AFRIpads -- reusable pads that last as long as eight hours and are effective for up to a year -- it was a game changer, especially for girls from poorer backgrounds who were using old rugs as pads.\n\n\"Most of them suffered from infections and other diseases, all that because of those rugs,\" Goodwine said.\n\nGirls are suffering fewer illnesses since using AFRIpads, made from absorbent, quick-drying fabric, that secures to underwear with snaps, Goodwine said. The school's headmaster Peter Mushi said attendance has improved after the girls got AFRIpads. He doesn't have precise figures, but said the effect was \"noticeable.\"\n\nSpeaking about the pads, Sophia Grinvalds, who co-founded the company with her husband in 2010, said \"the onset of puberty should not simultaneously mark the end of schooling or a monthly experience of indignity and shame and stigma.\"\n\nGrinvalds said the idea for reliable reusable pads came from her own experience living in a village in Uganda. While washing sanitary pads might be unusual in developed countries, it is not a barrier in poor communities, where women routinely use and wash pieces of cloth.\n\nAFRIpads has already made 2.5 million pads. The company is building a new factory that will make it possible to increase production three-fold.\n\nIt's not only access to pads that keeps girls out of school it's also period pain and untreated conditions.\n\nTisanai Shaushi says the beginning of her cycle is too painful to walk the short distance from her village to school; she often misses one or two days every month. She's never taken any pain medication. Like sanitary pads, they are out of reach for her.\n\n\"There are periods when I am in school and I cannot write because of the pains,\" Tisanai Shaushi said.\n\nTisanai Shaushi wants to be an engineer one day. But to do that, she needs to get good grades and win a place in one of the few high schools in her area. By keeping her out of school every month, Tisanai Shaushi's period is another barrier she has to overcome.\n\n\"I keep on asking myself why does it have to be that way,\" she said.\n\nMenstrual pain is poorly understood, even in the world's richest countries. Long-term conditions like endometriosis, which affects one in 10 women of reproductive age, are often misdiagnosed and go untreated. But in the developing world, pain isn't just misunderstood, it's ignored.\n\n\"[Girls] are leaving [school] early because of it, or they're not concentrating, so even if they are staying in school and being marked present ... they're not taking anything in,\" Rubli said.\n\nTisanai Shaushi is worried about falling behind. And she's not alone -- three-quarters of Tanzanian girls say their periods affect their performance in class, according to the Water and Sanitation Network.\n\nWhile primary school enrollment among girls and boys is nearly equivalent in Tanzania, that changes in secondary school when puberty hits.\n\nNearly 61% of girls of secondary school age are out of school compared to 51% of boys, according to the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey, a program funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nA 2018 study by Unicef and Unesco found girls are more likely to be out of school in Tanzania starting aged 15 and increasingly so as they get older.\n\nThe real price of periods\n\nElizabeth Scharpf was working for the World Bank in Mozambique when she saw the economic cost of menstruation first hand at a struggling factory making computer bags.\n\n\"The head of the factory told me that the female workers miss two to three days of work a month when they are menstruating,\" she said. A quick calculation revealed the business was losing 20% of its workforce because women could not afford menstrual pads -- and profits were taking a hit.\n\nIn response, Scharpf started Sustainable Health Enterprises (SHE), a social venture aimed at addressing period poverty.\n\nResearchers, NGOs and charities all agree that it makes economic sense to start taking periods seriously.\n\n\"Whether directly or indirectly, [menstruation] actually affects everybody...and yet people who menstruate are unduly punished, because of something that's completely normal and natural,\" Femme International's Rubli said.\n\nTanzania's government reports that 60% of women live in \"absolute poverty.\"\n\nThe period poverty situation in some cases is so extreme that research conducted by nongovernmental organizations found that women engaged in transactional sex to obtain pads.\n\n\"As a woman you're already economically disadvantaged to begin with and you're put in this position where you have to fight that much harder the rest of your life because of something that you had no control over,' Rubli said.\n\nSuzana Frederik has been through a lot. Her mother died when she was very young. When she was in fifth grade, she lost her father.\n\nPrimary education is free in Tanzania, but compulsory uniform, school shoes and equipment became prohibitively expensive for Frederik. She dropped out shortly after her father died.\n\nWhen she got pregnant aged 17, her boyfriend told her to get abortion. She refused and ended up alone, with a child to feed.\n\nSpending 2,000 shillings ($0.87) on a pack of pads meant less money to buy food for the two of them.\n\nShe said she was lucky. \"My periods lasts for three days, so one pack is enough for me.\"\n\nFrederick, who now lives in a shelter for vulnerable women, can get pads when she needs them. But access to pads is still out of reach for millions of women around the world.",

    "text": "CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals , a year-long series.\n\nBlantyre, Malawi \u2014 David Minyatso holds the voter registration card of his late wife, Selina.\n\nThe last time he saw her, she had just found out she was pregnant with their fourth child.\n\n\"She told me she was feeling symptoms of pregnancy. She left for her home village two days later to visit her parents,\" 36-year-old Minyatso said, standing in the doorway of their thatched-roof home in Kaseleka village, his daughters playing in the dirt yard outside.\n\n\"I was later told that she went to a traditional healer to seek abortion-induced drugs which killed her.\"\n\nSelina Black is among hundreds of women who die every year in Malawi as a result of the government's restrictive abortion law, which only permits the procedure in cases where the woman's life is at risk. Obtaining an abortion for any other reason is punishable by seven to 14 years in prison; while people supplying drugs or instruments to procure abortion can face three years in jail.\n\nIn Malawi, home to one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, unsafe abortion is estimated to account for 6%-18% of all maternal deaths, according to research conducted by Guttmacher Institute , a US-based reproductive rights think tank, and the Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Malawi College of Medicine.\n\nEntrance to maternity ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre.\n\nBut a draft \"Termination of Pregnancy\" bill is seeking to loosen the country's 157-year-old law. If approved, the bill would allow an abortion when the pregnancy threatens the physical or mental health of the woman, fetal abnormalities affect the life of the baby, or in cases of rape, incest and defilement.\n\nThe bill, which is currently being scrutinized by Cabinet ministers before it moves to Parliament for debate, has faced strong resistance from influential religious bodies in the country. About 81% of Malawi's population is Christian, according to a 2014 national survey\n\nIn the three years that have passed since the draft bill was first introduced thousands more women have resorted to risky clandestine abortions -- 141,000 in 2015 alone, according to the Guttmacher report.\n\nMinyatso says he was devastated when he heard that Selina was dead. The couple were still contemplating whether they would keep the baby, and he believes Selina's decision to go ahead with the abortion was influenced by other family members.\n\nMinyatso with his children at their home in Kaseleka.\n\n\"I don't have any plan to marry again,\" Minyatso, who struggles to work as a farmer and tend to his young family, said. \"I will never find a woman who will take care of the children as Selina did.\"\n\nChrispine Sibande, a human rights lawyer and former coordinator for the Coalition for Prevention of Unsafe Abortion (an abortion rights body comprising 45 health rights organizations lobbying for liberalized laws), says the draft abortion bill would allow women like Selina Black to access legal abortion safely.\n\n\"The 1861 law, under section 243 of the penal code, says abortion can only be performed by a skilled person through operation. Now you and me would ask 'who is this skilled person'? So the new law clarifies that,\" he said, underlining that while the current law allows abortion to save the life of the mother, the language is unclear.\n\nIn the absence of legal routes, many women seeking abortion in Malawi, like Selina Black, turn to traditional healers.\n\nA traditional healer shows some of the abortion-inducing concoctions.\n\nA healer, who asked not to be identified for fear of being arrested, said he has been providing abortion services to women since he started his trade a decade ago.\n\n\"I assist these women because they are currently desperate,\" he said, adding that doing so is against the constitution of the International Traditional Medicine Council of Malawi, a group of accredited traditional healers of which he is member.\n\nHe gives the women a concoction of what he calls \"abortion-inducing\" herbs.\n\n\"But still I advise my clients to immediately seek medical help if they notice any serious complications,\" he explains.\n\nChisale Mhango an obstetrician at Malawi's largest referral health facility, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, says he receives between 20 and 30 patients with post-abortion complications every day.\n\n\"The complications include injury to reproductive health organs because some of them use sticks to poke [the fetus] so that they can cause an abortion. And through that, they get infection which is a serious problem that would lead to things like surgery that may require removing the womb. And there is hemorrhage,\" he said.\n\nMhango says the post abortion care is also costly for the national health system.\n\n\"In 2015, the studies suggested that we were spending more than $2 million just to manage complications of unsafe abortion and yet the Ministry of Health budget is not increasing,\" he said. One recent report estimated that the Malawi government spends closer to $1 million annually on post-abortion care.\n\nGynecologist Dr. Mhango in his office at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre.\n\nMargret Kawala, the head of Kawala village, about an hour drive from the capital Lilongwe, says she lost her uterus after taking a concoction given to her by a traditional healer for an abortion.\n\n\"I was rushed to the hospital,\" Kawala, a 46-year-old single mother of of three, said. \"There, the doctors said I was losing a lot of blood because my uterus had burst and they had to remove it.\"\n\nA year after she lost her uterus, her husband left her.\n\n\"He said he wanted a wife who could give him another child. He left for good, and now, he has married another woman,\" Kawala said.\n\nMargret Kawala preparing porridge at her home.\n\nThough she struggles to feed her three children, and wishes she had the help of a partner, Kawala says she still feels lucky. Many other women in her area have died as a result of unsafe abortions.\n\n\"I have nothing to hide. That's why I speak openly about my situation. I want government authorities to know the gravity of harm that restrictive abortion laws have caused to women,\" Kawala said.\n\nStill, parliamentarians are noncommittal about their position on the draft bill, and refer to their religion when discussing its merits.\n\nAisha Mambo of Mangochi-Nkungulu Constituency said she wouldn't comment until she had scrutinized the final bill: \"And I will base my position on what my religion says about abortion because I can't act against the teachings of my religion.\"\n\nBack in Malawi's largest referral health facility, Mhango says the issue has nothing to do with religion.\n\n\"The debate is not about whether abortion is good or not,\" Mhango said, adding that the law needs to change if it can't be properly enforced.\n\n\"The debate is women are dying in increasing numbers in spite of the fact that there is a law in this country specifically to prevent women dying from unsafe abortion when their lives are in danger.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Before Anne Borg was finally diagnosed with breast cancer, she woke up early every week to be first in line by 6 a.m. for a medical consultation at a government-run hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nAlthough the hospital wasn't far, it was a long wait at the overcrowded clinic full of other medically uninsured South Africans.\n\n\"I don't have medical insurance, and so I couldn't afford everything that was going on. All the tests needed. You can get them quicker if you do it privately,\" Borg explained. \"At the public hospital, there are always between 20 to 30 people waiting ahead of you.\"\n\nIt took six months to get a diagnosis, and by that time, she needed surgery.\n\nThankfully, the 74-year-old recalls, a friend had advised her to ask about a project run by surgeons that help breast cancer patients get their surgery quicker on the public health system: Project Flamingo.\n\nWithin two weeks, Borg was scheduled for surgery. She had a double mastectomy in September, 2018.\n\nDr Liana Roodt operating on a patient and assisted by Dr Michael Brombacher.\n\n\"They saw that the [surgery] list was too long, so they formed Project Flamingo,\" Borg said. \"They gave up their own time on a Saturday to do these operations.\"\n\nBreast cancer is often detected at a late stage, with one study finding that the time to diagnosis in Cape Town was on average 8\u00bd months. Waiting times for a mastectomy after diagnosis can be up to four months in South Africa.\n\nProject Flamingo , founded by surgeon Dr. Liana Roodt, aimed to fix this after Roodt routinely experienced this in her clinic at Groote Schuur, a state-funded teaching hospital in Cape Town.\n\nBorg, who also went through cervical cancer when she was 31, now volunteers at the charity to make sure women don't experience the same challenges she did in getting treatment early.\n\nAn agonizing wait\n\nFor eight years, Roodt has been dedicating her free time and recruiting other surgical volunteers and nurses to get a backlog of vital life-saving surgery scheduled -- for free.\n\n\"So many operations need to be done quickly,\" Roodt said. \"But people were waiting three or four months after diagnosis before they could actually get their surgery done.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Breast cancer: Know the facts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Breast cancer: Know the facts 01:19\n\nMany operating rooms across the country were empty on weekends and public holidays, so in 2010, Roodt started raising funds to schedule and pay for the necessary facilities and nurses on those days.\n\n\"I just wrote an email to everybody in my email inbox,\" she recalled, confessing that she didn't know how to proceed at the beginning.\n\nA few survivors of breast cancer responded right away, and some of her colleagues offered to help kick-start her vision by volunteering their own free time to perform surgeries. Roodt admitted that it took \"quite a few years to gain momentum.\"\n\n500 free surgeries\n\nGetting the right permissions and regulations in place took an astonishing three years, Roodt said.\n\nEven so, more than 500 women have benefited from mastectomies after Roodt and other surgeons began devoting their time freely.\n\nHer \"catchup\" surgeries reduced the backlog at Groote Schuur from a 12-week wait to between two and four weeks.\n\nThe project has spread to nearby Tygerberg hospital, another public health institute in Parow, Cape Town, where Borg had her surgery.\n\nTheatre sisters (nurses) on a break between surgeries.\n\nThanks to Roodt's determination, Project Flamingo has managed to recruit about 10 regular surgical professionals, 10 anesthetists and 10 volunteers who make up 15 staff members devoting their time to each hospital.\n\n\"We've had enough people willing to donate their time. ... Finding nursing time is a challenge, so we pay nursing staff,\" Roodt said.\n\nTo make the process fair, Roodt and her team do not select the patients to benefit; instead, they're chosen from those already on the hospitals' systems.\n\n\"At least six to 15 surgeries are performed a month,\" Roodt said. \"Some of the patients have paid a small fee depending on their income. This is in agreement with the billing policy of the Department of Health to cover their hospital admission. We take care of the expensive part: the surgery.\"\n\nLack of options\n\nrecent report from a group of surgeons in South Africa suggested that the number of specialist breast centers nationwide needs to be increased to cope with demand.\n\n\"The standard we are saying is that you should not wait more than 30 days between going to see a doctor and getting a [breast cancer] diagnosis and we think that is possible,\" said Dr. Sarah Rayne, a surgeon and co-author of the 2017 report.\n\n\"Even in Johannesburg, where you have one of the best centers with the best outcomes, they fail to reach that target more than 60% of the time.\"\n\nRayne says the problem goes beyond timely operations.\n\n\"More than 87% of our [South African] patients require chemotherapy. It means that by operating alone you won't cure that person of cancer. Chemotherapy is only available in five or six centers in the whole country,\" Rayne said.\n\nRadiation equipment is also scarce. \"I think in the whole of Africa, more than half of them [radiotherapy machines] are in South Africa,\" Rayne said.\n\nThere are more machines in the US than the whole of Africa based on the data collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe other challenge is the health system itself.\n\n\"In South Africa, more than 65% of the population exist on less than 1,000 rand ($72) a month,\" Rayne said.\n\n\"Only 13% have private health care. Meanwhile, 70% of the doctors in South Africa only work in the private health system.\"\n\nThe problem is amplified in rural areas. \"The health clinic may not be staffed very well because the specialists don't live in that area.\"\n\n\"Doctors have left the provincial hospitals because there's persistent prolonged shortages of staff caused by austerity measures put in place by the provincial government,\" Mvuyisi Mzukwa, a chairman for the KwaZulu-Natal coastal branch of the South African Medical Association, told CNN in an earlier interview\n\nBut this is not a problem that's unique to South Africa. It's echoed across the continent.\n\nDr Liana Roodt in-between surgeries.\n\nDoctors going overseas\n\nSouth Africa has about six surgeons per 100,000 people. The ratio in the United States is 36.\n\nWatch, noted that there were 72,000 nationally registered Nigerian doctors, according to the A 2018 report by NOIPolls, a local polling company and advocacy group Nigeria HealthWatch, noted that there were 72,000 nationally registered Nigerian doctors, according to the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria, but only 35,000 practice in the country.\n\nMany doctors have emigrated to practice in the UK and US, the report notes.\n\nIn Ghana, Dr. Verna Vanderpuye, a consultant clinical oncologist at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, says it is hard to find the competency. \"The quality of cancer surgeries is also very important,\" she said, suggesting that surgical skills are limited in rural areas.\n\nBoth Rayne and Vanderpuye admit that persuading patients to have a mastectomy is also difficult.\n\n\"For young women, there's the fact that when they have a mastectomy, they only have one breast, and some, they lose their spouses and their position in the society,\" Vanderpuye said.\n\nIn a 2018 study , she found that a fear of mastectomy was the primary reason Ghanaian women present with advance stages of the disease.\n\nFear of treatment was also among the reasons why some women in South Africa had advanced breast cancer.\n\nAmy MacFarlane, a final year medical student closes a wound after operation.\n\nFeeling like a woman\n\n\"In an ideal setting, psychological support, counseling and even practical things like bereavement counseling are super important but seen as a luxury right now,\" Roodt said.\n\nIn South Africa, Project Flamingo started distributing pampering packs to patients that included bathroom essentials, magazines and beauty treats, all for free.\n\nSo far, 4,500 packs have been given away by Roodt and her colleagues and friends.\n\n\"We were trying to show that even though being in hospital can be a daunting experience and you see us running around the wards, we actually do care. ... This diagnosis does not mean you lose your feminist spirit, even though it feels like it,\" Roodt said.\n\nThey can still feel like a woman despite what they are going through, she adds.\n\nMichelle Rennie survived breast cancer 18 years ago, at the age of 46, and is now a director for Project Flamingo, sourcing products for the pamper packs.\n\n\"These pamper packs have helped to build a community,\" Rennie said.\n\n\"We give them to each newly diagnosed woman,\" she added.\n\nTo combat the loneliness that many cancer patients experience, the project also connects survivors like Borg and Rennie with new patients who offer mentorship and support throughout treatment.\n\nProject Flamingo theater nurses on a break.\n\nFor Borg, this kind of relationship building is important. \"Only if you have been through this can you understand what these people are doing,\" Borg said. \"I had a wonderful husband that went with me every day and sat with me every day, but there was a woman next to me with no one.\"\n\nAlthough Roodt has now joined private practice, she still devotes her unpaid time to the project, seeing patients at Groote Shuur.\n\nShe has expanded the project to cover other cancers and complications from cancer, such as colorectal cancer.\n\n\"Many [colorectal cancer patients] develop stomas and have to walk around with a poo bag attached onto their stomachs. But some of those stomas can be reversed after a period of time,\" she said.\n\n\"Imagine having a poo bag attached for two to five years and dealing with a stoma when you are living in a shack with no electricity and no running water,\" Roodt said. \"It's a complete nightmare. It's not good enough to just take care of the cancer but the quality of life is terrible.\"\n\n\"There is a part of me that is hopeful of there not being a need for Project Flamingo,\" she said. \"For a health-care system that is equal and fairer.\"\n\nThat is a \"pipe dream\" for now, she realizes, and so the project will continue to run for as long as it is needed.\n\nOn the unexpected success of the project, Roodt added: \"The amazing thing is the power of human stories. It's people telling their stories and humanity responding to it.\"",

When T'Challa -- played by Chadwick Boseman -- appears at the United Nations in the film, he is wearing an Ikir\u00e9 Jones scarf.\n\nIkir\u00e9 Jones created several pieces for the film, but only one -- the silk scarf \"From Wakanda, with Love\" -- made it into the final edit. The scarf is made in Italy and retails for $285.\n\n\"It was pretty stunning to see our work presented on such a large platform,\" said Oyejide.\n\nA reflection of heritage\n\nAfter working as a hip-hop producer collaborating with the likes of Detroit rapper J Dilla, and then training as an attorney, Oyejide founded Ikir\u00e9 Jones in 2012 with tailor Sam Hubler. He had studied with Hubler's sister at law school.\n\n\"It seemed like a natural decision for us to put our talents together,\" said Oyejide, who moved from Nigeria to the United States when he was a teenager. The brand relates to his family story. \"Ikir\u00e9 is a town in Nigeria where my father grew up, [and] Jones is my wife's family name,\" he added.\n\nIkir\u00e9 Jones has established an aesthetic that projects \"nobility and cultural inclusion,\" explained Oyejide. \"Our work blends conventional European silhouettes with bolder colors and fabrics that are inspired by African culture.\"\n\nThe Wakanda effect\n\n\"Black Panther\" made $1 billion at the box office globally within a month of release. Since it opened in the United States in February, Ikir\u00e9 Jones has a seen a fivefold increase in sales, according to Oyejide.\n\nThe boutique brand, which has just two permanent members of staff, sells to customers through its website.\n\n\"We find ourselves having to adjust to the vast increase in scale that we are putting out,\" said Oyejide. \"It's a good challenge for any business to deal with.\"\n\nHe wants his brand to use the spotlight to further its cultural mission.\n\nRelated: Designer bags a spot at Urban Outfitters\n\n\"The brand is essentially a vehicle to change perceptions about immigrants, migrants and vulnerable populations across the globe,\" said Oyejide. \"Each collection references issues that real people are struggling with. We attempt to tell their stories by using our art as a canvas for their vivid life experiences.\"",

    "text": "When professional footballers retire, some go into coaching while others become TV analysts. Not many produce their own Cognac.\n\nOlivier Tebily spent years on the international football circuit, including a lengthy stint in the English Premier League. The defender also played for his home nation of Ivory Coast.\n\nThe retired footballer, 41, now spends his days tending vineyards in western France, turning grapes into Cognac.\n\nTebily was a toddler when his family moved from Ivory Coast to France. It was there, as a teenager, that he was first introduced to life on a vineyard.\n\nBut what started as a summer job for a young man in search of pocket change would turn into a passion -- and a business.\n\nWhen Tebily signed his first professional contract at the age of 18, one of his first purchases was a few hectares of vineyards.\n\nHis family tended the vines during a football career with stops at clubs in France, Scotland, England and Canada. A highlight was representing Ivory Coast at the the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nRelated: Sofia Vergara is the best-paid actress on TV -- and a business maven\n\nWhen it was time to retire from the sport, Tebily knew where he wanted to be: Back among the vines.\n\n\"The day I decided to stop my career I stopped completely and I switched professions,\" said Tebily. \"I made the choice to stop football and resume my wine making.\"\n\nCognac is a special spirit. Renowned for its richness, the brandy can only be made from white grapes in the Cognac region of France. Popular brands include Hennessy and Courvoisier.\n\nTebily said it was hard to get started in the insular business, which produces annual exports worth $3.5 billion.\n\n\"For me to enter a world of viticulture ... shocked a lot of winemakers, because the vineyards are usually transferred from father to son,\" he said.\n\nRelated: This app helps regular folks make sense of wine\n\nTebily was able to expand his acreage when a Cognac producer who was nearing retirement took a liking to the former footballer and agreed to sell his vineyards.\n\n\"He preferred to let an African achieve his dream,\" said Tebily. \"It gave him satisfaction to do the opposite of what everybody expected.\"\n\nThe 22 hectares that Tebily now owns yield roughly 11,000 bottles of Cognac a year. He sells part of the haul to a larger producer, while the rest is sold under his own label, Cognac OT.\n\nThe label has four varieties that sell for between $37 and $305. The cheapest is aged for a minimum of two years, while the premier \"Tres Vieux\" offering matures for over 25 years.\n\nTebily said he hopes his career change will serve as an inspiration to others.\n\n\"I realized that everybody is capable of doing something completely different than they did before,\" he said. \"For an ex-player to do something else is very encouraging, it's very gratifying.\"",

Other marketing projects include Twitter-activated vending machines and artsy skateboarding parties.\n\nEvans attributes much of the firm's success to its eccentric marketing efforts, but the company also relies on a winning local ingredient.\n\nIndigenous to South Africa, BOS organic tea is made from the rooibos (red bush) plant. It's \"quintessentially from South Africa\" said Evans. The company says the tea is rich in antioxidants, a selling point for increasingly health-conscious consumers.\n\nThe company is tapping into a booming global market for premium beverages, including products without alcohol. Over the past decade, traditional carbonated drinks have lost 10% of their market share, according to Evans, and a wave of competing brands such as Britain's Fever Tree have enjoyed rapid growth.\n\nWith flavor combinations ranging from lemon and peach to lime and ginger, BOS sold roughly 10 million units last year. \"We've run at north of 70% compound annual growth rate since 2011,\" said Evans.\n\nThe CEO believes the next big market is the United States, which offers \"tremendous growth opportunities.\" Having only launched in California in December, he expects half of the firm's sales to come from the United States within three years. The tea is being sold in premium natural food retailers.\n\nBOS launched its first international office in Amsterdam in 2014, and it now sells iced tea in 14 countries.\n\nThe company does need to be careful about sourcing its key ingredient. Rooibos plants take three years to generate their first harvest.\n\nBut that hasn't scared away investors. For example, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson purchased a 10% stake in the company.",

The number and sensitivity of the dishes have enabled scientists to produce breakthrough images using the telescope.\n\n\"They just did everything right,\" said Farhad Yusef-Zadeh, an astronomy expert at Northwestern University in Illinois. \"This image that I saw it just blew me away, I never thought we would see these details.\"\n\nRelated: Why Goodyear and Delta Faucet are doing research in space\n\nBuilt over 10 years at a cost of $330 million, the telescope is used by scientists to study hydrogen activity and pulsars.

Only 50,000 people in Africa had access to such drugs 15 years ago.\n\nIts largest manufacturing plants are in Europe and South Africa, where lower costs support mass production. The European sites focus heavily on the use of technology.\n\nBy acquiring products from rivals such as GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXF) and AstraZeneca (AZN), Aspen has been able to benefit from economies of scale.\n\nBut it can't escape the pressure for lower drug prices that is weighing on the entire pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\"For Aspen, we expect the greatest challenge will be delivering improved returns,\" said Standard Bank's Chetty.",

Tourists who bring banned sunscreens to Palau after that date could have them confiscated, while retailers selling the products will face a fine of up to $1,000.\n\nTour operators will be required to offer customers \"with a reusable alternative\" to plastic or polystyrene bottles, cups, straws and containers, though the act stopped short of a full ban on the items.\n\nVeteran reef scientist \"Charlie\" Veron introduces CNN's Ivan Watson to life beneath the Coral Sea.\n\nSunscreen dangers\n\nIn a statement , Palau's tourism ministry said it was the first country in the world to introduce such a ban on a national scale, and listed the newly prohibited compounds \"known or strongly suspected to cause endocrine disruption and other damage to marine wildlife such as corals, fish and invertebrates, but also humans.\"\n\nThese include oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, triclosan and several parabens. Both oxybenzone or octinoxate have also been banned in Hawaii under a law that kicks in on January 1, 2021 , and many of the chemicals have been prohibited in eco-reserves in parts of Mexico for a decade in order to protect coral.\n\nWhile the risks to humans posed by these ingredients have yet to be conclusively proven, there is growing evidence that they can cause bleaching, deformities, DNA damage and ultimately death in coral when sunscreen washes off beachgoers or is discharged into wastewater treatment plants and deposited into bodies of water.\n\nRelated content How one resort is fighting to save Thailand's Phi Phi Islands\n\nThis is of particular concern for countries and areas where coral reefs are widespread and major tourist attractions, but many experts recommend consumers avoid non \"reef-safe\" sunscreens regardless of where they swim, due to fears the chemicals could harm other parts of the ocean environment.\n\nAccording to the Oceanic Society , \"between 6,000 and 14,000 tons of sunscreen -- the equivalent of 25 to 60 million bottles -- wash off of snorkelers and swimmers into coral reef environments each year.\"\n\nThe society advises snorkelers and divers in particular to reduce their need for sunscreen by instead wearing more protective clothing in the water, and to always use \"reef-safe\" products.\n\nWhile calls for banning types of sunscreen are growing, the country which safeguards the Great Barrier Reef doesn't seem poised to do so anytime soon. Queensland, the Australian state next to the Reef, advises visitors to wear non-polluting sunscreen, but does not require it.\n\nRelated content 10 of Australia's best beaches\n\n\"I wouldn't support a ban in Australia because I think it would cause more health problems and it would be unlikely to really help our reef,\" he said.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Many people stay put most of November in anticipation of the money and time they'll spend on the impending Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas holidays. But you may want to rethink that idea.\n\nBecause it's off or \"shoulder\" season for numerous destinations , there are plenty of deals to be had and discounted flight and hotel rates to enjoy. Also, the Southern Hemisphere is starting to warm up in November, as it enters late spring, while the Northern Hemisphere is cooling off both in temperature and travel intensity.\n\nIf you can get away in November, either before or during the holiday, you'll find plenty of moderate weather, thinning crowds and bargain prices.\n\nIn no particular order, here are five marvelous places to consider in November:\n\n1. Phoenix, Arizona\n\nCNN's Kelly Bowman explores Phoenix, a city with both business savvy and Southwestern style.\n\nNovember is the beginning of high season in the hottest big city in the USA . But because high season is just starting up, you'll likely get some relief from the peak high-season prices in winter, while still escaping the heat of peak summer temps.\n\nHere are a few only-in-November events:\n\n-- Arizona International Auto Show : If autos get your motor humming, this is the place to be. You can see hundreds of cars from dozens of manufacturers. November 22-25, 2018. (100 N. 3rd St., Phoenix, Arizona 85004; +1 602 262 6225)\n\n-- Azcentral Wine & Food Experience : This is a must-attend event for fans of Martha Stewart things -- or really anyone who enjoys good food and wine. November 3-4, 2018. (16601 N. Pima Road, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260; +1 480 502 0815)\n\n-- Fountain Festival of Fine Arts and Crafts : The festival started up in the 1970s and is one of the largest of its kind in the Southwest. Enjoy paintings, other artwork, jewelry, local food and more. November 9-11, 2018. (Avenue of the Fountains, 12925 N. Saguaro Blvd. Fountain Hills, Arizona; +1 480 837 1654)\n\nLet's look at some outdoor options since the summer furnace is off. (Heads up: You'll likely need a jacket at nights -- deserts can get quite cold, too):\n\n-- Desert Botanical Garden : This is an excellent place to take a walk and learn more about the surprisingly varied plant life of the desert. (1201 N. Galvin Pkwy., Phoenix, Arizona 85008; +1 480 941 1225)\n\n-- Camelback Mountain : You can partake in an inspiring mountain hike here, just 20 minutes from downtown Phoenix. Just be warned: Its two trails are considered quite difficult. Echo Canyon trail is the steeper one, and you'll need to use hand rails and pull yourself over boulders. (N. Echo Canyon Pkwy, Phoenix, Arizona). Cholla Trail is the longer one. (6131 E. Cholla Lane, Phoenix, Arizona 85253).\n\n-- Goldfield ghost town : It's hard to resist a good ghost town out West. Come pan for gold, ride a narrow-gauge railroad and see what saloons were like back in the late 1800s. (4650 N Mammoth Mine Road, Apache Junction, Arizona 85119; +1 480 983 0333)\n\nIf you're a Frank Lloyd Wright follower or just like a good home tour, be sure to check out Taliesin West . It was Wright's winter home and is considered one of the most personal of the architect's works. (12621 N Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, Arizona 85259)\n\nPhoenix has some fine museums, and that include the Heard Museum , which is devoted to the works and cultures of Native American tribes. (2301 N Central Ave, Phoenix, Arizona 85004; +1 602 252 8840)\n\nPhoenix and its environs (particularly Scottsdale) are known as resort and spa country. Here are a couple of suggestions:\n\n-- Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Montelucia : You might feel like you've traveled to the Andalusia region of Spain when you arrive here. The resort's Joya Spa offers massages, facials, meditation and naturopathic services such as IV therapy. (4949 E. Lincoln Dr., Scottsdale, Arizona 85253: +1 480 627 3200)\n\n-- The Phoenician : Enjoy golf, fine dining and of course, the spa. From the rooftop pool to the tranquility room, the emphasis is on relaxation. You can even get your own specialized blend at the aroma bar. (6000 E Camelback Rd, Scottsdale, Arizona 85251; +1 480 941 8200)\n\n2. Rome, Italy\n\nThe Trastevere neighborhood is a popular culinary stop in Rome. ANDREAS SOLARO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNovember in Rome marks the beginning of the off season. The days (and lines) are shorter, a bit chillier and possibly wet.\n\nIf you plan accordingly, this can be a lovely time to visit, though: As temperatures drop, so do flight and hotel prices, and if the weather is not the most pleasant, there are plenty of indoor activities to partake in with a lot less people. A few rainy-day ideas:\n\n-- Pantheon : Built by Emperor Hadrian between 118 and 125 A.D., it was for the worship of every god. In 609, it was converted to a Christian Church. In a city of many amazing ancient sites, this is one of the top. (Piazza della Rotonda, 00186 Roma RM, Italy; +39 06 68300230)\n\n-- Ara Pacis Museum : This museum has an interesting history, both ancient and recent: It is built around a sacrificial altar commissioned by Emperor Augustus dating to 9 B.C. while the new museum surrounding it dates to 2006. (Lungotevere in Augusta [corner via Tomacelli] - 00186 Rome)\n\n-- Nuovo Mercato Esquilino : Peruse the stalls at this indoor international market. You can buy anything from fresh fruit to clothes. It's a great place for people-watching. (Via Filippo Turati, 160, 00118 Roma RM, Italy)\n\nMany museums and archeological sites around Rome, including the Colusseum, are free on the first Sunday of each month, while the Vatican Museums are free on the last.\n\nIf you catch Rome on a nice afternoon, take in a sunset view at Gianicolo Hill, one of the more overlooked sights in Rome. You can take a taxi up to the viewing terrace, soak up the view then walk down to Trastevere for dinner.\n\nA couple of suggestions:\n\nGet a pizza alla napoletana at Pizzeria Nerone . (43, Via del Moro, 00153 Roma RM, Italy; +39 06 5830 1756).\n\nOr, if you prefer Roman-style, check out the ever-popular Pizzeria ai Marmi . (Viale di Trastevere, 53, 00153 Roma RM, Italy; +39 06 580 0919)\n\nRelated content 15 best coffee bars in Rome\n\nWhile it's great that peak tourist season has come to an end in November, what's more important is that wild boar hunting and truffle season has begun. Which means menus throughout Rome will showcase these two delicacies. Not much of a wild boar hunter? Take a day trip from Rome to Umbria for a truffle hunt instead.\n\nfrom September 19 to November 25, 2018. If that wasn't enough to keep you busy, check out the Romaeuropa Festival . This multidisciplinary and cultural arts fete with international participation hosts eventsfrom September 19 to November 25, 2018.\n\n3. Melbourne, Australia\n\nMelbourne frequently shows up hight in lists of \"most livable cities.\" Shutterstock\n\nAustralia's late spring is typically a shoulder season and a perfect time to visit. Pleasant weather coupled with the Melbourne Cup makes this a much busier time of the year in Victoria's capital than the rest of Australia. If you are planning a trip to Melbourne in the beginning of November, book lodging early so that you can witness the city of 4.5 million celebrate \"the race that stops a nation.\"\n\nThe Cup will be held on November 6 in 2018 at Flemington Racecourse and is one of the most famous horse races in the world. Some 100,000 people are expected to attend, and another 700 million will watch it televised.\n\nIf you are attending the race, be sure to dress in your best derby attire and to plan your transportation in advance. If not, you can still participate in this national phenomenon by watching it at a local watering hole. If you miss actual Cup day, there are still plenty of related festivities before and after.\n\nRelated content Australia in summer: 40 things to do\n\nNot feeling so racy?\n\nGet out on the Great Ocean Road . It spans 249 miles from Torquay to Allansford and includes such iconic sites as Twelve Apostles and Port Fairy. There are several one and multiday tours that can be booked out of Melbourne.\n\nMelbourne was designated a UNESCO City of Literature in 2008 and is considered the cultural capital of Australia. Here are a few cultural places and events you might want to check out:\n\n-- National Gallery of Victoria : The gallery has more than 8,000 Australian paintings and drawings as well as an impressive international collection of art. Founded in 1861, it's the nation's oldest museum. (Two locations about 10 minute walk from each other: 180 St. Kilda Road, Melbourne, VIC 3006 and Federation Square, Flinders St & Russell Street, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia; +61 03 8620 2222)\n\n-- Dogapalooza : This dog-friendly music festival takes place on November 11 in Burnley Park.

(328 Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia)\n\n4. Denver, Colorado\n\nFoodie, Orion Carrington, shares some of his favorite places to grab a bite in Denver.\n\nWinter has just arrived in Denver come November, which means that ski resorts are starting to open. There are a handful of decent slopes within a few hours' drive from the city. (Just be sure to verify opening dates before you jump in the car.)\n\nWinter Park is a little more than an hour from Denver and is the longest continually operated ski resort in Colorado . Check with the website for the opening of the winter season, which is usually around mid-November depending on conditions. (85 Parsenn Road, Winter Park, Colorado 80482; +1 970-726-5514)\n\nAnother option not so far from Denver is Keystone Resort . It's set in the scenic White River National Forest of the Rocky Mountains, with grades from gentle to steep. (1202 Jones Gulch Rd, Keystone, Colorado 80435; +1 970 754 0001)\n\nNot much of a skier or snowboarder? With average highs in the low 50s Fahrenheit (around 11 Celsius , being out-and-about in the Mile High City is still quite pleasant when dressed appropriately. This beer town has plenty of breweries to sample.\n\nOur recommendation? Stop by Great Divide Brewing Company for a seasonal Hibernation Ale. (Two locations: 2201 Arapahoe St., Denver, Colorado 80205 or 1812 35th St., Denver, Colorado 80216; +1 303 296 9460 )\n\nRelated content Amtrak ski train debuts between Denver and Winter Park\n\nA couple of annual events in November to consider:\n\nIt takes place November 2 though 10 in 2018 and features more than 300 events across the city, including Know Your Arts First Friday, free admission to museums and plenty of family-friendly functions. -- Denver Arts Week It takes place November 2 though 10 in 2018 and features more than 300 events across the city, including Know Your Arts First Friday, free admission to museums and plenty of family-friendly functions.\n\nfrom October 31 to November 11 in 2018.

The films are screened at a variety of venues across the city.\n\nIf you're looking for a hotel stay that adds to the Denver experience, you may want to consider The Oxford Hotel . It's the city's oldest operating hotel, having opened in 1891. It can give you a real sense of the city's past while still providing all the modern touches. (1600 17th St, Denver, Colorado 80202; +1 303 628 5400)\n\n5. Beijing, China\n\nArt connoisseur? These are the places you're going to want to hit next time you're in Beijing. Video by Black Buddha.\n\nNovember marks the waning of autumn in Beijing . There is still plenty of fall foliage to see in the beginning of the month. Hotel and tour prices begin to drop mid-November as it gets increasingly cooler, transitioning into winter.\n\nExpect cool, clear days at Badaling Great Wall in November (and pack a warm jacket). About 45 miles north of Beijing, it is fairly easy to reach by bus or train from the city. Give yourself at least two hours for viewing this feat of ancient engineering . If you didn't get enough of the sea of red maples there, check out nearby Bandaling Forest Park on your way out. (The Great Wall at Badaling, Badaling, Yanqing County 102112 China; +86 10 6912 1383)\n\nCompared with Badaling, Mutianyu Great Wall is less well-preserved and slightly more difficult to reach via public transportation from Beijing. It also draws less of a crowd (especially on holidays) and offers a later leafing season, well into late November. So, depending on when you plan your trip, it might be the better option. (Great Wall at Mutianyu, Mutianyu Road, Huairou District, Beijing China; +86 10 6162 6505)\n\nOn nicer November days, you can still enjoy the outdoors and the fall color. A couple of ideas:\n\n-- Fragrant Hills Park : This imperial garden in northwestern Beijing. It offers stellar autumnal views as the maple, smoke and persimmon trees change hue. (40 Maimai St., Haidian District, Beijing, China)\n\n(19 Heishanhu Beikou, Haidian District, Beijing; +86 10 6288 4508) -- Baiwang Mountain Forest Park : It's about two miles from Summer Palace. Soak up the colors from the flat Friendship Pavilion or from Lanfeng Pavilion on top of the mountain.(19 Heishanhu Beikou, Haidian District, Beijing; +86 10 6288 4508)\n\nBeijing (and the rest of China) has not been left out of Asia's creative architectural boom -- a delight for people who love to take pictures. The CCTV Headquarters Building, completed in 2008, is certainly one of the most unusual and striking ones, with an emphasis on shape versus height. Navigating Beijing on your own can be daunting, but a self-guided architectural tour can be rewarding, too. (32 E 3rd Ring Rd Middle, GuoMao, Chaoyang Qu, China, 100001)\n\nAfter all this sightseeing and leaf-gandering, you'll surely be hungry. What is a trip to China's capital without eating some Peking duck? Many tourists and locals agree that DaDong makes the best crispy roast duck in Beijing.

    "text": "(CNN) It has taken 30 years and millions of dollars, but Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum can now finally call himself a Melbourne Cup winner.\n\nHis Cross Counter, a three-year-old bay gelding ridden by Kerrin McEvoy, came from the outside to beat Marmelo by a length to bring home the $2.8 million Melbourne Cup following years of disappointment for the billionaire Dubai ruler.\n\nCross Counter's historic victory was described by his British trainer, Charlie Appleby, as \"everybody's dream.\"\n\n\"This is all down to Sheikh Mohammed, he's the one that's given us all the encouragement to take the chances in what we do internationally,\" Appleby told the website of Godolphin, the Maktoum family's global horse-racing stable founded by the Dubai ruler in 1992.\n\nCup drought\n\nThe win by Cross Counter, the first English horse to triumph in the Melbourne Cup, came 30 years after Sheikh Mohammed fielded his first horse, Authaal, in the \"race that stops a nation.\" It was also 20 years after Faithful Son became the first runner for the Godolphin operation in Melbourne.\n\nJUST WATCHED The Breeders Cup returns to Churchill Downs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The Breeders Cup returns to Churchill Downs 02:00\n\nSince its foundation in 1992, Godolphin, which was named after Godolphin Arabian, a stallion imported to England three centuries ago, has fielded 4,664 horses in more than 26,000 runs. In the past 26 years, Godolphin horses have won 5,190 races, including 288 Group 1 wins.\n\nThat's a strike rate of 20% for the group -- the racing arm of Sheikh Mohammed's Darley breeding operation -- which has outposts in Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Ireland, France, the US and Australia.\n\nStill, until this week, Godolphin had only three second places and two third places to show for in the Melbourne Cup, despite investing as much as A$1.1 billion ($800 million) in the sport Down Under, according to a 2016 report by the Australian Financial Review citing Godolphin Australia's financial results filed with the country's corporate regulator the year before.\n\n\"Learning curve\"\n\nIn 2016, Godolphin sent five horses to Australia to compete in the race, only to walk away empty-handed once again.\n\nThis year, Sheikh Mohammed had three runners in the Melbourne Cup, spread across his three training operations headed by Appleby and Saeed Bin Suroor in the UK and UAE and James Cummings in Australia.\n\nBin Suroor's Best Solution and Cummings' Avilius finished eighth and 22nd respectively, but Appleby struck gold.\n\n\"We've been competitive, but we've learnt more on each trip about what will make us more competitive,\" said Appleby, who was saddling his third Melbourne Cup entry after stepping up from assistant trainer in 2013 following the eight-year ban handed to then Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni for illegally administering steroids to some of his horses.\n\n\"That's what it's all about, the learning curve. I'm just in a fortunate position to have the horses to make the call on which are the right ones to bring down here.\"\n\nCross Counter (R) wins the Melbourne Cup ahead of fellow British horse Marmelo.\n\nThe Newmarket-based Appleby, who gave Godolphin its first Epsom Derby winner, Masar, in June, added: \"This is huge for everybody. For me, of course this is the biggest thing along with the Derby. This year has just been one of those amazing years.\"\n\nStellar 2018\n\nAfter some fallow years, this season has proved to be stellar one for Godolphin, which ended the British Flat racing season as the leading owner, claiming 113 wins, including its first Epsom Derby, and winning \u00a34.5 million in prize money, according to the website of the British Horseracing Authority.\n\nBin Suroor's Thunder Snow also won the $10 million Dubai World Cup in Meydan in March.\n\nBut horse racing is a costly business and often prize money doesn't cover the costs unless the horse is used for breeding.\n\nIn a perfect completion to a stellar year highlighted by #Masar's Derby victory, #ThunderSnow's Dubai World Cup and 27 other G1s, #CrossCounter epitomised the #Godolphin philosophy of pushing global boundaries and striving for perfection https://t.co/i7NWKOj8zs \u2014 Godolphin (@godolphin) November 6, 2018\n\nDuring the 2018 Flat season, Goldophin fielded 242 horses in Britain. With the cost of training a thoroughbred averaging around \u00a320,000 ($26,000) a year, that means it may have spent as much as \u00a34.8 million on getting the animals race ready.\n\nTrying to win races in Australia is even more expensive, with flights from Europe costing as much as $68,000 per animal.\n\nVictoria Racing Club chairwoman Amanda Elliot paid tribute to the persistence of Sheikh Mohammed, who is also the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"There is no one who has put more horses into this race and this is his wonderful first win,\" Elliott told the New Zealand Herald. \"I hope he's watching. We send him our best. And many, many congratulations.\"",

A hotel in Sydney has faced both backlash and praise for hosting an anti-Melbourne Cup event, News.com.au reported.\n\nProtesters used the opportunity on Tuesday to highlight animal rights and the country's treatment of refugees.\n\nThe Cup dates back to 1865 and was the result of a rivalry between two horse race organizing committees -- the Victorian Jockey Club and the Victorian Turf Club, with the latter introducing the event as a handicap race. While it's now famously run on the first Tuesday of November, it wasn't until 10 years after its inauguration that the date became the tradition. It's since become the defining fixture of the Australian horse racing calendar.\n\nWhile the first Cup was won in 1865, the race was originally run four years earlier -- but the winner only received prizes and a cash purse. The winner of the first Cup, Mr Marshall, owner of Tory Boy, described it as a \"monstrosity,\" according to the National Museum of Australia.\n\nOutlandish celebration avoided\n\nThe Melbourne Cup has long eluded British trainers, and while Magic Circle had a good opportunity to break the spell, it was another UK-based horse that took that honor.\n\nMagic Circle, a pre-race favorite, was already a six-time winner when he joined Williams' 100-strong string at Dominion Stables and looked the part for the British trainer and owner Marwan Koukash after claiming stellar victories in the Chester Cup and at Sandown this season before booking his place in Tuesday's headline event at Flemington.\n\nWilliams has already entered the history books by becoming the first trainer to win at every racecourse -- Flat or jump racing -- in the UK, but came up short with Magic Circle, a six-year-old gelding he bought last October for Koukash, a former refugee from the Middle East who has built up a multimillion dollar business in England's northwest.\n\nCross Counter's win has spared Melburnians the sight of Koukash's outlandish planned celebration.\n\n\"I fit into my G-string now,\" Koukash told racing.com three days before the race.\n\n\"I fit into my G-String now.\" Meet Magic Circle's owner @drmarwank.

    "text": "(CNN) It was just a silly dare among teenage boys. What could it hurt to eat a small slug?\n\nSo Australian teenager Sam Ballard grabbed the slimy creature and gulped it down. He had no idea that the slug carried a potentially deadly worm that would put him into a coma that lasted more than a year, paralyze his body and ultimately take his life.\n\n'Trying to act like grown-ups'\n\nIn 2010, 19-year-old Sam, an avid rugby player, was drinking with Jimmy Galvin and several more of his Australian \"mates\" when a slug began crawling across Galvin's concrete patio at his home in Sydney.\n\n\"We were sitting over here, having a bit of red wine appreciation night, trying to act as grown-ups,\" Galvin recalled in a video interview this year with Lisa Wilkinson of \"The Sunday Project,\" a current affairs talk show that airs on Network 10 in Australia.CNN reached out to Galvin but has not heard back.\n\n\"And then the conversation came up, 'Should I eat it?' \" recalled Galvin. \"And then off Sam went and bang, that's how it happened.\"\n\nIn this special report @Lisa_Wilkinson talks to the amazing family and friends of Sam Ballard #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/UXY5KGeWjF \u2014 The Project (@theprojecttv) April 1, 2018\n\nAfter downing the slug, Sam became weak and complained of severe pain in his legs, according to \"The Sunday Project.\" Sam's mother, Katie Ballard, told the news show that at first they worried he might have multiple sclerosis, which had afflicted her husband. But doctors said no, that wasn't the cause.\n\nThen Sam turned to his mother and told her he had eaten a slug, \"And I went, 'No, no one gets sick from that,' \" Katie Ballard said. CNN has also reached out to Ballard.\n\nSoon, however, doctors told them otherwise. Sam had developed rat lungworm disease from the infected slug, changing his life forever.\n\nKatie Ballard, left, with her son, Sam Ballard, in Sydney.\n\nWhat is rat lungworm disease?\n\nRat lungworm disease is caused by a parasitic worm called Angiostronjilus cantonensis. As the name suggests, the parasite lodges in the lungs of rats and is later excreted in poop.\n\nAlong comes a slug, snail, freshwater crab, shrimp, prawn or frog, and either eats the rat dung or the parasite works its way into the creature infecting it. Fish, however, do not spread the parasite.\n\nHumans can be infected if they eat the raw or undercooked contaminated animals, or vegetables carrying unseen snails or slugs that have not been thoroughly washed.\n\nIn addition, says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , beverages can become contaminated with worms if left open for snails and slugs to enter.\n\nUnlike in rats, the worm's life cycle is not completed in a human. So instead of passing through the digestive tract, the worm larvae \"can get lost, and it will go to the brain, and it'll stay there,\" said Heather Stockdale Walden, an assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida. The parasite is not passed from human to human.\n\n\"When it gets to the brain, you can have eosinophilic meningitis,\" Walden said , which is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, fever and a stiff neck, the CDC said.\n\n'So full of love'\n\nMost cases of rat lungworm disease are typically mild. But in some cases, like Sam's, the disease can cause catastrophic damage.\n\nSoon after the diagnosis, Sam fell into a coma, where he remained for 420 days, Ballard said in the Australian news report. He woke up paralyzed, unable to eat without a tube or move without intense effort. He required 24-hour care, seven days a week.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut the disease didn't affect his mental faculties, his family and friends said.\n\n\"He's in there, 100%,\" Galvin told \"The Sunday Project.\" \"I apologized to Sam about everything that happened that night in the backyard. And he just started bawling his eyes out. I know he's there.\"\n\nLate last week, Sam died, \"The Sunday Project's\" Wilkinson wrote in a blog post\n\n\"Sam passed away on Friday morning at Hornsby Hospital, not far from where he grew up, surrounded by 20 of those he most loved in the world,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Katie tells me 'the room was so full of love,' \" Wilkinson said. \"One of his friends there in the room continued, 'He had his voice and he said \"I love you\" several times to Katie.' \"",

    "text": "Lima, Peru (CNN) As part of his medical training, Dr. Ricardo Pun-Chong spent time doing rounds in hospitals throughout Lima, the capital of Peru.\n\nDay after day, he noticed families sleeping on the floors.\n\nMany of them, he learned, had come from faraway villages, with little or no money, to get medical treatment for their children.\n\nNavigating the country's difficult terrain -- which spans the Andes Mountains to the Amazon -- often means traversing unpaved roads and can make for a dangerous trip.\n\n\"The journey, it's very difficult,\" Pun-Chong said. \"People have to cross the mountains or take a boat to cross the river. It can take many days. Just imagine having this trip with a kid with cancer.\"\n\nFar from home and loved ones, and unable to pay for a place to stay in Lima, many families found themselves homeless while fighting for their children's lives.\n\n\"I couldn't get the picture of the families sleeping on the floor out of my mind,\" Pun-Chong said. \"So, I decided to do something for them.\"\n\nSince 2008, Pun-Chong's nonprofit, Inspira , has provided free housing, meals and overall support for sick children and their families while they undergo treatment. The organization has helped more than 900 families who've come from all over Peru.\n\nPun-Chong, who lives a few blocks from the shelter and is there almost every day, runs the organization with the help of a small staff and an army of passionate volunteers. He spends every holiday with the families there.\n\n\"The kids inspire me every day,\" Pun-Chong said. \"When I'm with these kids, and I feel how strong they are, I understand that there are no problems that we can't resolve.\"\n\nCNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Pun-Chong about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\n\nCNN: What are some of the obstacles facing these families?\n\nRicardo Pun-Chong: We have people who come from the Amazon, travel on a boat and from there take a bus. And you're with a sick child, with a fever. Once they reach the city, they don't have any resources. Sometimes they don't even speak Spanish; they speak Quechua, Aymara or other dialects.\n\nFor leukemia, the most frequent cancer in kids, the first treatment is about six months. But to stay here is too expensive. Sometimes families, they have to sell everything they have. They feel helpless. They feel really alone. They either have to make it work and stay, or they make the difficult trip back home without their children receiving full treatment.\n\nCNN: What kind of environment have you created at the shelter?\n\nPun-Chong: The shelter is a very special place. We not only wanted people to have a place to sleep and food to eat, we also wanted to create a space to help the kids be cured. It's a place with a lot of love.\n\nI don't want it to feel like a house, I want it to feel like a home. In the shelter we don't have TV because I prefer to talk to the kids and teach them how to create things. I want them to use their imagination.\n\nThe families can stay in our shelter as long as they need, and I want them to know they are not alone, there are a lot of people that are with them.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Ricardo Pun-Chong: It's the little things Replay More Videos ...

When I go to the shelter, I leave my stethoscope at home. I come in here as Ricardo, not as a doctor. I want each and every one of them to feel special. I try to lift the spirits of these kids who probably have just undergone surgery. I play and have fun with them and make sure that during this hard time, these kids get to just act like kids.\n\nWe are doing everything we can to connect and engage with them. We listen to stories, color, paint, play in the park, ride bicycles. We try to give these kids special things and special experiences. I try to make them laugh, to enjoy themselves.

    "text": "Copenhagen is a bustling city full of ambitious professionals and young families. Yet working long hours here is frowned upon.\n\nJust 2% of employees in Copenhagen work 40 hours a week or more, according to an OECD report, freeing them up to spend time with family, join organized sports, volunteer or participate in other community programs.\n\nThe cost to participate in those programs, which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving? Free. This helps encourage residents to get involved.\n\nTheir ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. That\u2019s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual World Happiness Report commissioned by the United Nations.\n\nOther things play into Copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.\n\nMen cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don\u2019t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. The city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. And people use them: Nearly half of commuters in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.\n\nThough parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. By 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. Many of the new parks created will be \u201cpocket parks,\u201d or small green spaces for city residents. The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.\n\nHere\u2019s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark: Ninety-six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.\n\nThis supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) New commercial satellite images released Monday have identified more than a dozen undeclared North Korean missile operating bases, another sign that Pyongyang is continuing to move forward with its ballistic missile program amid indications that talks with the US have stalled in recent months.\n\nWhile the network of undeclared sites has long been known to American intelligence agencies, it has not been publicly acknowledged by President Donald Trump, who asserted that North Korea was \"no longer a nuclear threat\" following his June summit with dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment on the images, but US officials have expressed concern about North Korea using hidden and undeclared locations to continue to work on improving their missile technology and possibly their nuclear program.\n\nThe new images, first reported by The New York Times , show researchers at the Beyond Parallel program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies have identified 13 of an estimated 20 hidden missile operating bases unreported by the North Korean government.\n\n\"These missile operating bases, which can be used for all classes of ballistic missile from short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) up to and including intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), would presumably have to be subject to declaration, verification, and dismantlement in any final and fully verifiable denuclearization deal,\" the report states.\n\nPhotos: Satellite photos reveal North Korea missile base Overview of the Sakkanmol Missile Operating Base and adjacent unidentified military facility, March 29, 2018.

Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nUS intelligence has long assessed that the North Koreans have stored much of their weapons capability, including mobile missile launchers, in underground mountain bunkers.\n\nSpecifically, the images focus on the Sakkanmol missile base, which \"currently houses a unit equipped with short-range ballistic missiles but could easily accommodate more capable medium-range ballistic warheads.\"\n\n\"Despite the difference in interpretation between the US government and the North Koreans over what these declarations have meant, the Singapore declaration and the new Korean declaration, for North Korea watchers it has been pretty clear that the North has not been willing to give up its entire nuclear program,\" Lisa Collins a fellow with the Korea Chair at CSIS and one of the authors of the report, told CNN.\n\nHowever, an official with South Korea's Blue House called the report \"nothing new\" and told media Tuesday \"the United States and South Korean intelligence service hold more detailed information using the military satellites,\" and that nuclear sites couldn't be \"undeclared\" as there had been no agreement with North Korea to declare them.\n\nThe official went on to say that North Korea had not previously pledged to close the Sakkanmol Missile Base, the focus of CSIS's report, saying, \"There had been no treaty or negotiation that mandated closing the missile base.\"\n\nMonday's report comes days after Trump told reporters his administration is \"very happy with how it's going with North Korea\" despite the administration's announcement, in the middle of the night as last week's midterm elections results were coming in, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's meeting with a key aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had been postponed.\n\nTrump has conveyed a starkly different image than the one painted by US military officials, foreign diplomats and sources familiar with developments who told CNN that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is \"really angry\" about the US refusal to offer sanctions relief and that personal friction between US and North Korean negotiators may be slowing progress.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing dance between officials in Washington and Pyongyang previously told CNN that North Korea's stance is that the US \"must make a move before we make the next one.\"\n\nBut the US appears unwilling to oblige, at the moment, according to a US official, who said the Trump administration wants to move away from the \"tit-for-tat\" approach of the past.\n\n\"There has been a move away from past administrations' approach to North Korea in terms of 'we will give you a little here if you give us a little there' ... kind of a tit-for-tat piece. ... We haven't seen that work in the past, so the President is insistent on holding the full pressure campaign until he gets the full denuclearization,\" a US official told CNN.\n\nNorth Korea has often argued it is unable to provide comprehensive details about the locations of its nuclear and missile sites because that could serve as a target list should the situation escalate into an armed conflict. But Collins said that the hope is that \"this type of analysis and data would help to push forward the negotiations rather than cause more blockage.\"\n\n\"It would actually get rid of one of the primary excuses or reasons why North Korea has not produced a list,\" she said, adding that \"open source and independent data\" can help the process as US officials might be wary of publicly disclosing information that they believe could compromise sources and methods.\n\nWhen asked about Monday's new report, a State Department spokesperson implored Kim to \"follow through on his commitments -- including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs.\"\n\n\"President Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments \u2014 including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs \u2014 a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people,\" the spokesperson told CNN.\n\nBut experts point out that Kim has not offered to stop producing ballistic missiles, let alone unilaterally give them up, and said on New Year's Day that he would continue to mass-produce ballistic missiles and deploy those that have already been tested.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Monday that the images once again show that Trump's comments on North Korea have been a \"fabrication.\"\n\n\"The North Koreans have not signed any document working out, laying out, what steps they are going to take to denuclearize,\" Hagel said. \"There has been nothing stated, agreed to, framed signed, except what President Trump says they've said ... but now ... we have a whole different story, and it is the reality, it is not fantasy,\" he added.\n\nVipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies nuclear proliferation, told CNN that Kim's actions do not amount to \"deception since he said on New Year's Day that North Korea would mass-produce and deploy its missiles that it already tested.\"\n\nNarang added that the images released Monday identify \"operating bases which, until and unless there is a deal, Kim can't eliminate without undermining his security.\"\n\nAsked about the State Department's response to Monday's report, Narang called the assertion that North Korea has committed to eliminating its ballistic missile programs is \"misleading.\"\n\n\"There has been no agreement or discussion remotely that detailed --- even on nuclear systems, and many of these are short range conventional missiles which North Korea has never said were on the table,\" he told CNN.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN that experts have known about these sites for years, and it is no surprise that they remain operational given Kim's declaration in January that North Korea would shift from research and development to the mass-production of nuclear systems.\n\n\"Kim didn't dupe Trump. Trump duped himself,\" Lewis said, noting that North Korea has never offered to unilaterally disarm.\n\nSakkanmol missile base is one of the facilities where North Korea deploys its mass produced systems, he said.\n\nStill, Trump has sought to convey the image that progress continues to be made and teased a possible second summit with Kim in the near future.\n\n\"We're in no rush. We're in no hurry,\" Trump told reporters at a White House press conference last week. \"The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes are home.\"\n\nWhile North Korea claims that it has taken some steps toward denuclearization, experts say those moves are largely cosmetic and easily reversible. Kim's regime has shuttered a missile engine testing facility; destroyed the entrances to its nuclear test site; and promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, if Washington takes what it calls \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nIn July, Trump touted indications that North Korea had begun dismantling \"a key missile site\" after the prominent monitoring group 38 North published images showing Pyongyang had begun decommissioning its Sohae Satellite Launching Station.\n\nBut while that step attracted significant media attention at the time, Monday's report states that the dismantling of the Sohae facility \"obscures the military threat to US forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases.\"\n\nCollins told CNN that she believes one reason North Korea canceled the latest round of talks with Pompeo is because they might be targeting \"the very top levels of negotiations\" -- another meeting between Trump and Kim.\n\nHowever, she also warned that \"you can't get anywhere without these working-level talks because that's where the nitty-gritty stuff happens.\"\n\n\"You can't get a verifiable list of anything unless nuclear weapons experts are part of the process,\" she said. \"Is President Trump going to create a list of all those facilities? Does he even know where some of these places are? I would be very skeptical.\"\n\n\"There have to be working-level talks, but the North Koreans are clearly targeting a big package deal, for them, which can only happen if President Trump is there to make the decision,\" Collins added. \"But I think the US has been very cautious and careful to keep the negotiations moving forward at the working level and try not to have President Trump jump every time there is an offer.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Tommi M\u00e4kinen has come a long way since becoming Finland's national ploughing champion at the age of 18.\n\nHe transferred his tractor skills -- learned on his father's farm in Puuppola -- to the world of rally, swiftly becoming a force to be reckoned with. His racing career yielded four consecutive world championship titles between 1996 and 1999, and a total of 24 race wins on the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) circuit, including five in Finland and four in Monte Carlo.\n\nBy the time M\u00e4kinen retired in 2003, he had cemented his legendary status in the sport. But that was not enough. In 2016, he returned to the sport as principal of the TOYOTA GAZOO Racing (TGR) rally team.\n\nFrom the track to the sidelines\n\nJUST WATCHED Tommi M\u00e4kinen: The Flying Finn Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tommi M\u00e4kinen: The Flying Finn 02:03\n\nAccording to M\u00e4kinen, the new job requires many of the same skills as driving. \"A driver needs (to be) pretty strong mentally,\" he tells CNN Sport. \"You need to have a good technical understanding (of the car)... and, of course, you need to understand the soul of the car.\"\n\nM\u00e4kinen has transferred his driving skills into management. His experience of both sides helps him to lead the team. As Miikka Anttila, a TGR co-driver, says, \"Tommi knows and understands what's going on in the sport, what is important for us, and what is important for the crew to perform well.\"\n\nHe has also brought his competitive drive.\n\n\"He loves the sport, and he wants to win,\" says Tom Fowler, TGR's chief engineer. \"He wants us to be constantly moving forwards, to make sure we're ahead of the game.\"\n\nRoad car vs. rally car\n\nJari-Matti Latvala and co-driver Miikka Anttila fly in their TOYOTA Yaris during the 2018 Rally Finland.\n\nBuilding a rally car is not simple. The shell may look like a normal car -- TGR's Yaris WRC looks like a souped-up version of the everyday model -- but inside, there are no cushioned seats, automatic windows or air conditioning. It has been stripped to the bare minimum. Every component has been fine-tuned to enhance the vehicle's aerodynamics, reduce its weight, and ultimately increase its speed.\n\nIn M\u00e4kinen's eyes, there is no such thing as the perfect rally car -- the model is constantly being tweaked. Unlike a normal car that might be serviced every 20,000 kilometers, a rally car will be serviced every 50 or 100 kilometers, he says. Each car has two dedicated engineers and five mechanics -- a person for each corner and one manning the engine.\n\n\"We're learning all the time, from every rally, every stage, every kilometer,\" he says.\n\nAnd that, he explains, is part of the thrill.\n\n\"My active career was very, very exciting,\" says M\u00e4kinen. \"But I've always been that kind of person that wants to find new challenges... (Since) we started our racing operation, every day has been different.\"\n\nM\u00e4kinen (left) inspects his car after a crash during Rally Corsica in 2001.\n\nThe Flying Finns\n\nTOYOTA returned to the sport in 2017 after a 17-year absence and it has already made its mark.\n\nIn just its second season back in the sport, TGR has registered three wins so far and sits second in the manufacturers' championship.\n\nAs well as M\u00e4kinen, the team boasts two Finnish drivers, Jari-Matti Latvala and Esapekka Lappi.\n\nAcross all forms of motorsport, there has long been a saying: \"If you want to win, hire a Finn.\"\n\nThe first of the flying Finns, Timo M\u00e4kinen, drives an Austin Morris Mini during a rally in the 1960s.\n\nThe Nordic country has a history of breeding some of the world's best rally drivers. The first \"flying Finn\" was Timo M\u00e4kinen -- no relation to Tommi -- who dominated the sport during the 1960s and 1970s. Finnish drivers have won a total of 13 championships since the WRC began in 1979 -- second only to France on 15, which has jumped ahead thanks to S\u00e9bastien Loeb and S\u00e9bastien Ogier.\n\nFinland's varied conditions, its forested tracks, fast-flowing gravel roads and spectacular jumps make it the perfect testing ground, earning it the title of \"the grand prix of rallying.\"\n\nM\u00e4kinen is pleased to be working on home ground, with TGR based in Finland.\n\n\"Our environment for the test program is absolutely brilliant here,\" he says. \"Then it's a question of professionals... (We have) experienced designers, experienced engineers, and experienced drivers.\"",

For a young boy, it was a dream come true. That was the moment the self-confessed superfan fell in love with the sport.\n\nLampinen estimates he spends 25 to 30 days a year watching rally. As soon as the routes for an event are published, he studies the course, visits the stages and marks out the corners where he will spectate -- \"the corners that we expect to have action, you know, crashes,\" he says.\n\nA national obsession\n\nIn Finland, a devoted rally fan is not uncommon. The sport is hugely popular in the country, with the Neste Rally attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators each year.\n\nFans cheer on TOYOTA's Finnish team during 2017 Neste Rally.\n\n\"Rallying has become sort of a national sport,\" Kai Tarkianen, clerk of the course for the Neste Rally, tells CNN. \"A lot of the athletes that are well known outside Finland come from motorsport -- obviously we have our Formula One world champions, but we also have our rallying world champions.\"\n\nWith a population of just 5.5 million , Finland produces a disproportionate number of motorsport champions -- a total of three in F1 and seven in rally -- commonly known as the \"flying Finns\". In fact, it leads both sports with its number of champions per capita.\n\nSo, what makes Finland a successful breeding ground for motorsport champions?\n\nJUST WATCHED The life of a rally superfan Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The life of a rally superfan 02:29\n\nWild roads\n\nFinland's road network is approximately 450,000 kilometers long, according to the country's transport agency . Of this, 350,000 kilometers are private and forested roads.\n\nFor young drivers this means a vast practice arena on their doorstep.\n\nFinland's isolated roads are a perfect training ground.\n\n\"The guys from the village just come and close a stretch of road in the middle of the night and go and see who's the fastest,\" says Tarkianen. \"Then somebody thinks, 'hmm, this is quite fun'... and then they go into hobby rallying and work their way up from there.\"\n\nThis taps into the general appeal of rallying. \"(It's) a layman's sport,\" says Tarkianen. \"Anybody with a license can come up.\"\n\nExtreme conditions\n\nFinland hosts one of the world's fastest rallies.\n\nUnlike circuit racing, there is no controlled environment. The sport takes place on normal public roads -- it's about going as fast as you can from a to b, in whatever conditions.\n\nAnd in Finland, a country where ice and go-karting are popular pastimes, drivers are ready to take on ice, snow, dust and mud. Even the national driving test -- known to be one of the most rigorous in the world -- requires special training for slippery conditions.\n\n\"Finnish weather gives us a perfect base for learning driving skills,\" says Lampinen. \"You have to know how to drive in the winter weather, you have to know how to drive on the gravel in the summer.\"\n\nThe Finnish edge\n\nSkid control is vital on the country's gravel roads.\n\nThe Neste rally is famous for its jumps, blind crests, and its hard-packed gravel roads, which make it one of the fastest races in the series. As cars typically slide more easily on gravel than asphalt, it also makes it one of the most challenging.\n\nFinnish drivers have an advantage, says Jari-Matti Latvala, a driver for TOYOTA GAZOO Racing (TGR). \"You know the characteristics of the roads...so you know what to expect, where it jumps and how the corners will go.\"\n\nFormer rally world champion, Juha Kankkunen of Finland, jumps during the Neste rally in 2001.\n\nNow in its 68th year, the rally has become a family outing, uniting the nation, says Tom Fowler, chief engineer for TGR.\n\n\"Everybody knows something about rally in this country, that brings everybody together,\" he says.\n\nThe popular support makes rally even more accessible, drives investment into infrastructure, and inspires drivers.\n\n\"Home soil brings you pressure,\" says Latvala. \"But on the other hand, it motivates you because you have a lot of Finnish people supporting you.\"",

The Vendee Globe is almost gladiatorial -- half a million people turn up at the start, probably because they don't think you're coming back.\n\n\"This one I don't think about not coming back. I think about drinking rum in the Caribbean in a few weeks. It's a different challenge, but it's not a leisure cruise. The boats have become faster and faster, in theory it's a downwind race which is pretty stressful, there's no time to get into a rhythm and you'll be more tired than ever before... you're just not 2,000 miles south of Africa.\"\n\nAlex Thomson will take on the Route du Rhum transatlantic race in his Hugo Boss yacht.\n\nPain, no gain\n\nBut while Thomson will have his hands full sailing his state-of-the-art 60ft foiling monohull Hugo Boss, he will also have to stay mentally sharp.\n\nIf you weren't excited enough already then watch this \u2b07\ufe0f. 4 DAYS TO GO \u26a0\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89#RDR2018 #sailing #WednesdayMotivation pic.twitter.com/ovfoAGpz73 \u2014 \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Route du Rhum - Destination Guadeloupe ENG (@routedurhumENG) October 31, 2018\n\n\"You have to be able to manage yourself,\" he says. \"You have to be able to make rational decisions. If you don't there's a good chance you're going to get hurt or damage the boat.\n\n\"If you go up on deck and take the sheet off a winch the wrong way you could lose your arm. So I'm just fully conscious all the time of what my physical and mental condition is like and I think that's really important.\"\n\nThomson will sleep in 20 to 40 minute bursts every two to four hours. He has an alarm clock wired to a klaxon to wake him up. If he is still asleep five minutes later a wristband will deliver a mild but \"not very pleasant\" electric shock.\n\nEarlier in his career he experimented with having two colleagues live with him before a race, making sure he slept for 20 minutes every two hours to prepare his body for the sleep patterns at sea.\n\nIt got to the point where they had to stand at the door and poke him with a stick, like rousing an angry bear. It was, apparently, a testing experience for all concerned.\n\n\"It was such a painful process, we figured the pain wasn't worth the gain,\" he says.\n\nJUST WATCHED The most grueling sailing race in the world Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Conrad Colman: Face-to-face with Mother Nature 03:11\n\nExtreme methods\n\nIn the Route du Rhum, Thomson is not allowed outside assistance so another technique when he is faced with a difficult dilemma is to have imaginary conversations with notable sailors such as Sir Robin Knox-Johnston or other experts.\n\n\"It's just a little mental trick of being able to get somebody else's opinion without speaking to anyone,\" he adds.\n\nBut the \"most extreme example\" from his tool kit is a \"car crash\" technique to avoid complacency, which is when accidents can happen.\n\nThomson says he is an \"emotional person\" and his mood on the boat tends to be governed by how he is doing in the race.\n\nIf he is faring badly he will work harder, foregoing sleep and food -- which is, at best, undisciplined. But worse, he says, is if he is doing well he gets \"high\" which leads to complacency.\n\nTo combat this, the pair have developed a system that automatically counters feelings of \"invincibility\" with the emotional surge of a near car crash.\n\n\"By practising, so that whenever you feel you're on top of the world you get the shot of adrenaline from the near car crash, and you wonder what's going to happen next, it's a way of leveling me out and stopping me becoming complacent,\" he says.\n\nThomson kite surfs high above his Hugo Boss yacht in a publicity stunt.\n\nThomson dismisses the notion that long-distance solo sailors must be in some way \"weird\" because of the amount of time spent alone in an unremitting, potentially life-threatening environment, and says it all depends on how you view the world.\n\n\"You have to be a strong personality and have the ability to put yourself through things most people wouldn't consider,\" he says.\n\n\"If you want to call that odd, then we're all odd. I'm different in that I'm more extroverted so it's not natural for me to be on my own, but it's how you look at things.\n\n\"People say you must get lonely, but I say you can be lonely in a large group of people. I separate loneliness from isolation, and it just makes it easier to deal with. People say three months [at sea] is a long time -- I don't think it is. It goes so quickly.\n\n\"The natural human tendency is to look at things in a negative light, but I try to look at things in a positive mode.\n\n\"It becomes less about the speed of boat and more about people management and I find that pretty interesting.\"",

    "text": "Red Hook, New York (CNN) \u2014 As historians mark exactly a century since the end of World War I, a group of pilots take to the air in a museum's vintage airplanes, bringing a bygone era back to life.\n\nLocated just two hours north of New York City, the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome in New York's Hudson Valley boasts around 60 vintage biplanes -- including reproductions of the famed SPAD VII and the classic Sopwith Camel.\n\nTake a turn off picturesque Stone Church Road, cross a foot bridge and you're jumping back 100 years to a time when airplanes were made of wood and fabric held together by a bit of wire -- and not much more.\n\nWatching these planes fly is all the more fascinating when you realize that World War I started just about a decade after the first flights by the Wright brothers, making it the first major conflict involving the large-scale use of aircraft.\n\nIn those days, many considered duty as a combat pilot a virtual death sentence. More than 15,000 pilots died during the war.\n\nThat's not too hard to believe when you watch these fragile airplanes in action. Pilots flew essentially totally exposed in open-air cockpits affected by wind, rain, and of course, enemy fire.\n\nPilots had to master dangerous, difficult-to-control machines and were pitted against one another in close combat. Often the air war became crude and personal, as enemy pilots flew so close to each other they could see each other's facial expressions -- or hand gestures.\n\n360\u00b0 Experience: Fly in the WWI fighter planes\n\nThe experience of flying vintage biplanes 'in the moment'\n\nCNN's drone production team, CNN Air, recently documented some of the museum's World War I-era fighter planes re-enacting dogfights at Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome. A team of FAA-certified drone pilots flew their unmanned aerial vehicles in concert with aerodrome pilots, capturing breathtaking video of their aerobatic skills.\n\nFor the pilots who come to Old Rhinebeck to fly these planes, this is not a job. It's more like a pilgrimage to be a part of something unique.\n\n\"It's very visceral. It's literally in your face,\" said museum Vice President and Chief Pilot Clay Hammond. \"You're wearing a helmet and goggles and the wind's blowing against your cheeks. You're hearing and seeing and smelling everything that goes on with that airplane. It's much more in the moment. It's much more of a tactile experience.\"\n\nThe longtime fighter pilot tradition of keeping score began in World War I. This was the war when pilots started counting their kills.\n\nThose who downed five or more enemy aircraft won the right to be called \"aces.\"\n\n\"When we're up there in these 100-year-old airplanes, you can absolutely think about what it would have been like to have been in that situation on the Western Front in 1917 and how those guys must've felt in terms of kill or be killed,\" Hammond said.\n\nIs there anything inherently more dangerous about flying these old airplanes -- versus a new plane that's designed to perform complex aerobatic maneuvers?\n\n\"Only a little bit,\" Hammond said. The aerodynamic performance capabilities of these planes obviously aren't as sophisticated as today's aircraft.\n\n\"As pilots we're always taught to respect the limits of whatever machine we happen to be in,\" Hammond said. \"So there's always risk mitigation going on any time we fly anything. It's just that we probably think about it a little more carefully when flying a 100-year-old World War I fighter.\"\n\nRelated content 12 of the best military museums around the world\n\nArmistice Day to Veterans Day\n\nIt was 100 years ago on November 11, 1918, when leaders agreed to an \"armistice\" peace deal to end a four-year war that had claimed millions of military and civilian lives.\n\nIn the United States, they turned it into a national holiday called Armistice Day. By the 1950s, that day became more widely known as Veterans Day.\n\nMany of Old Rhinebeck's exhibits are original World War I-era planes, including a Nieuport 10 dating back to 1915, a 1917 Morane-Saulnier A-1 and the famed Curtiss JN-4H -- widely known as The Jenny. In 1918 over Fort Tilden, New York, a Jenny became the first plane ever launched from a blimp. Jennys also were used to start the US Air Mail system.\n\nHammond described the museum's 1918 Jenny as one of its crown jewels.\n\nOld Rhinebeck's 1918 Curtiss JN-4H \"Jenny.\" David Trost/CNN\n\n\"It's the plane a pilot of the time would have been first exposed to ... before moving up to the next step which would generally be actual exposure to the actual fighters that they would be flying on the front line,\" he said.\n\nThe museum's Jenny is powered by an original, water-cooled Hispano-Suiza V8 engine that can muster 150 to 180 horsepower. The plane is exceedingly slow, with a takeoff speed around 35 to 40 miles per hour and a maximum speed of about 75 mph.\n\nRelated content Who really killed the Red Baron? Account offers new wrinkle\n\nThe museum also flies two Fokker Dr.1 triplane reproductions -- three-winged planes made famous by the fearsome German fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen -- aka the Red Baron.\n\nVon Richthofen was ace of aces, credited with 80 victories -- the most of any WWI pilot. He died after being gunned down in flight in April 1918 in France.\n\nOld Rhinebeck Aerodrome was founded in 1958 by Cole Palen, an aviation enthusiast who loved tinkering with old planes and getting them running again. After he passed away, the aerodrome was established as a nonprofit museum dedicated to preserving and flying many of these historic aviation touchstones.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 It's a fact of life for travelers. Airports can make the journey a stressful and frustrating experience.\n\nYet airports throughout Asia are making the once-dreaded terminal a destination in its own right thanks to cutting edge technologies and carefully crafted, ultra-modern spaces.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that Asia based airports dominated the 2018 Skytrax World Airport Awards\n\nSo what separates them from the global pack?\n\nRelated content World's best airport swimming pools\n\nAviation writer Harriet Baskas, founder of StuckAtTheAirport.com , points to the bonus amenities that make both travelers and the non-traveling public look forward to a day at the airport.\n\n\"Asian airports -- especially Singapore's Changi Airport and South Korea's Incheon Airport -- have perfected the art of creating airport terminals that are destinations unto themselves with art, culture, food, entertainment, restful spaces, green spaces and, of course, plenty of shopping,\" she says.\n\nTechnology takes over in Seoul\n\nPassengers arriving at Seoul's Incheon airport (number two on this year's best airports list) for the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games in February were among the first to try out the airport's state-of-the-art new Terminal 2, opened only weeks before.\n\nAs well as adding much-needed capacity to the country's main international gateway, developers designed the building around passenger needs by focusing on technology.\n\nThe centerpiece of the terminal is the Great Hall, which covers four stories. Decorated heavily in granite and wood, it features artworks by local artists.\n\nBut the fun starts when you notice the fleet of robots on hand to help passengers navigate the airport.\n\nForget finding an information desk or complicated terminal map.\n\nThese friendly helpers will scan your boarding pass and escort you to your gate, conversing with you in any of four languages -- Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese.\n\nWhen not directly interacting with passengers, the robots helpfully wander around flashing final boarding calls.\n\nRobots at Incheon are not only there to help guide passengers, however. There's also a model tasked with making sure the new terminal is kept clean and tidy, remembering where the dirtiest places are and efficiently working its way around like a giant Roomba.\n\n\"I was also impressed to find live music, centers where people could learn about and try out traditional arts. and fun play areas for both kids and adults,\" says Baskas.\n\nThe best airport in the world\n\nl e v a r t\n\nWhen it comes to building a unique and world-leading passenger experience, Singapore's Changi Airport surely sets the benchmark.\n\nIn March, it was voted the world's best airport for an impressive sixth year running by Skytrax.\n\nAccording to the airport's CEO, Lee Seow Hiang, the award \"spurs us to continue to deliver the best passenger experience for all who travel through Changi Airport.\"\n\nSo what sets it apart from every other crowded hub airport?\n\nThe stand-out feature is the number of leisure facilities on offer. The four terminals are crammed full of retail, dining and entertaining options for both arriving and departing passengers.\n\nTerminal 3, Baskas explains, \"has its famous multi-story slide, a butterfly garden and several other themed garden spaces\", while passengers waiting for a flight can visit the cinema. The world's tallest airport slide is of course loved by kids.\n\nOver in the departure hall of Terminal 2, the Enchanted Garden is a sensory experience of twinkling lights, meandering paths and motion-activated sounds of nature as travelers pass giant flower sculptures.\n\nIf all that sounds a little too overwhelming, the terminal's orchid and sunflower gardens offer a much more tranquil experience before take off.\n\nTerminal 4 , which opened in 2017, offers the latest in automated technology.\n\nPassengers can check in at a kiosk and print their luggage tags electronically thanks to a facial recognition system that bypasses the need for manual identity checks.\n\nMoving through the departure gate is a centralized experience, with an automated two-in-one approach (boarding card and passport check in one go). At the final security check, passengers don't need to remove electronic equipment from their bags thanks to the use of CT scanners.\n\nThe final boarding is also serviced by automated gates equipped with a facial recognition system.\n\nSo what's next? In 2019 Changi is to open its flagship \"Jewel\" terminal, where the boundaries between airport and fantasy are to be blurred even further.\n\nCentering around a floor-to-ceiling indoor waterfall and rainforest, the 10-story donut-shaped structure will be filled with dining and shopping experiences and a new hotel. It will be linked to all terminals for passengers, or even curious tourists, to enjoy.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nJapan: Clean and customer focused\n\nJapan's aviation sector has long been helmed by forward thinkers.\n\nWhen the country's original urban airports were hemmed in by growing cities, the aviation sector led the way in developing offshore airports.\n\nFor instance, Osaka's Kansai International Airport, opened in 1994, sits on a man-made island in Osaka Bay. It was built to ease congestion at Osaka International Airport.\n\nThen, Japan pioneered incorporating high speed rail and other transport exchanges into its airports to allow seamless onward travel around the country.\n\nThese days, airports in Japan are working on the passenger experience.\n\nNo grand departure hall, no windows and no moving walkways, but 1 kilometer of running track instead. Visit Narita's Terminal 3, Japan's new low cost terminal.\n\nStepping into any of the three terminals at Haneda airport near Tokyo offers a master-class in designing for clarity and efficiency. Another 5-Star Skytrax airport, voted third in this year's poll, it's been lauded for its cleanliness and comfort, plus the all-important friendliness of staff and immigration officials who direct passengers in good English should the clear, interactive signs not suffice.\n\nAgain, like other airports in the region it's looking to robotic technology. This includes the use of automated wheelchairs that can take passengers with limited mobility safely to their gates.\n\nFurther to the south, another one of the country's famous island airports is Chubu Centrair, near Nagoya.\n\nOpened in 2005, it has a shopping mall that's been organized into streets. Upstairs in the terminal is something few airports offer -- a bath house to relax in before or after a long flight.\n\nFrom early in the morning, passengers can deposit their bags (and their clothes) and enjoy the four pools and spa facility, and even dry off while watching the aircraft on the outdoor deck.\n\nBeijing: A model for future airports\n\nPassengers traveling to and around the Asia-Pacific region are set to increase by 1.8 billion over the next 20 years and the region's airports are readying for the deluge.\n\nIn China, which is planning to build 136 new airports by 2025, an aviation monster is emerging near the capital.\n\nDaxing International Airport is set to supersede Beijing Capital airport when it opens in late 2019.\n\nRecent images from inside the huge, flower-shaped superstructure hint at the scale of the project, which will eventually have a capacity of 100 million passengers per year.\n\nInside it will offer short walking distances to gates, while gardens and tall ceilings will give the impression of space.\n\nBut how will passengers travel between the city, some 67 kilometers away, and the new airport?\n\nRelated content The world's busiest airport revealed\n\nThat's where the new inter-city train link comes in.\n\nIt's set to whisk passengers away at 350 kilometers per hour, making light work of the distance and cutting journey times significantly.\n\nCompare that to the gridlock and poor public transportation options at many other airports and you'll see why Beijing has the problem covered before the airport has even opened.",

Its name is \"Muraka,\" which means \"coral\" in the Maldives' local language Dhivehi.\n\nIn addition to a bed, shower and the other typical components of a hotel room, the Muraka takes luxury travel to another level with a private gym, a bar, an infinity pool, butler's quarters, an ocean-facing bathtub and most importantly an underwater bedroom with unparalleled views of the ocean.\n\nThe top floor, which is above the water, has a \"relaxation deck\" where you can sun yourself.\n\nThe price tag? A cool $50,000 per night, although you can't actually book the Muraka for single night stays -- it's only accessible via a four-night, $200,000 package that includes a personal chef for all meals and the use of a private boat.\n\nBonus: Those who book this insane package get automatic Hilton Diamond status.\n\nThe Muraka isn't the first underwater venture at the hotel.

William Frankland settles into his beige armchair and recounts a life story Hollywood producers could only dream of.\n\nHe was born as a twin in 1912; began medical school in the 1930s; held a military post in Singapore during WWII that resulted in being held as a POW for more than three years; returned to England after the war and studied under Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered penicillin; became an allergist and developed a pollen count system to help people understand what triggered their allergic reactions.\n\nAll of that happened by the 1950s, and in honor, the Allergy Clinic at St. Mary's Hospital in London was named after him.\n\nAt that point, he had more than a half-century of his career to go.\n\n\"So often, people say, 'How is that you've lived so long?' \" he said. \"And I say, 'That's just luck, nothing else.' \"\n\nAt 106 (and 1/2, he'll remind you), Frankland still occasionally consults with patients and contributes articles to journal publications. He loves reading medical journals and keeping up with the field he helped pioneer.\n\n\"[This] has been quite a unique experience,\" Watkins said, \"and one that I think very few people will have the privilege to do, even more so, with Dr. Frankland, of this remarkable long life, in which he's seen so many changes, so many challenges, and has been through so many really quite remarkable experiences, which most of us can't even comprehend.\"\n\nBeyond longevity, what sets Frankland apart is the sharpness of his mind.\n\nHe's writing a paper now about how penicillin was discovered, based on his time with Fleming.\n\nWilliam Frankland at his wedding, before he went off to war.\n\nHe acknowledges the sadness, as well as the highlights, he has experienced over the years, choosing to swallow the negative memories and fear he experienced and focus on happiness.\n\nMemories from his life remain vivid. He even says he remembers his third birthday, when he indulged in too much cake and ended up sick.\n\n\"I'm so interested in not only the present and the future but particularly, I suppose, in the past,\" Frankland said. \"And it's nice looking back on some of the enjoyable trips that I did.\"\n\nA pioneer in allergies\n\nIn 1953, at St. Mary's Hospital in London, Frankland popularized the pollen count, now used worldwide to help doctors and patients understand allergy triggers. He ran tests on himself to make his discoveries.\n\n\"I caused acute severe anaphylaxis in myself from an insect,\" he explained. \"Nowadays, you wouldn't be allowed to do such an experiment. But to me, I was determined to find out [how] I reacted to mosquitoes, fleas or whatever insect bites me.\"\n\nFrankland with his microscope.\n\nHis institute focused on hay fever, and his research soon linked hay fever symptoms to pollen, changing everyone's understanding of the condition.\n\nThat drive to contribute to his ever-expanding field is still here. Since he turned 100, he has written several articles for publication and isn't quite done yet.\n\n\"I wrote four articles from the age of 100 to 105,\" he said. \"Two of them are solos; the others were multiple authors. But now, of course, I'm 106, I'm going to write one more, and it's almost finished.\"\n\nKeeping your mind strong\n\nA decline in mental abilities over time is an aspect of aging feared by most.

Keeping the mind active and engaged late in life can actually help generate new brain cells and neural connections.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"When you get old, [there are] some of the things you can't do,\" Frankland said from his armchair. \"I'm too old to go on runs and keep fit in that sort of way. But I certainly keep my brain going all the time. And I read a lot of scientific journals and things which come to me monthly, and some -- even the British Medical Journal -- once a week.\"\n\nIn 2015, at the age of 103, Frankland received the Order of the British Empire for his significant contributions to the field of allergy research. So, how has he done it all these years?\n\n\"I think what helps me is that if you lead a sensible life,\" he said, \"and don't smoke and don't overeat, and do a bit of exercise.

    "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) Among the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, eight senior citizens gather at the Happy Valley Recreation grounds in the Wan Chai district. It's time for their weekly class in qigong, an ancient Chinese mind-body practice similar to tai chi.\n\nIt's summer on the island, and at 8:30 in the morning, the temperature is already 80 degrees Fahrenheit, with an unforgiving level of humidity.\n\nBut the hot weather does not deter qigong Master Joe Lok's students; they believe wholeheartedly in the positive effects the practice has on their health.\n\nThe word qigong is a combination of \"qi,\" meaning energy, and \"gong,\" which loosely translates as an accomplishment or practice, explained Lok, who has been practicing qigong for nearly 30 years.\n\nIt is the accomplishment or practice of energy and involves becoming aware of your breathing, sensing the energy within you and then following a series of slow, coordinated movements.\n\nMovement, meditation and controlled breathing are the staples of every qigong session, with the ultimate focus being holistic well-being.\n\nLok explains that \"in order to do qigong ... we have to be pretend to be empty, so the first thing to empty is the mind, so we try not to think of anything and only listen to our breathing, relax all the strength and relax the mind, so it's some kind of meditation.\"\n\nMeditation has been shown to improve stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Experts believe it goes hand-in-hand with healthy habits that can improve our longevity.\n\nAs a result, qigong itself is a health practice, Lok said.\n\nFeeling the energy\n\nFor Lok, it is vital that all his students experience \"qi\" before they begin any movements. He practices Taoist qigong, which has a strong connection with nature, he explained. In his class, he says that you can start to experience the \"qi\" by simply holding a specific posture.\n\nYour feet should be between hip and shoulder distance apart and your toes turned out slightly. From here, Lok encourages you to breathe deeply and straighten the curve in your lower spine by moving your hips slightly forward. With your hands hanging loosely, relax your body so you don't feel any pressure or tension on your joints.\n\nLok directs his students to focus and straighten their fingertips slightly with their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing at an angle down to the ground.\n\nStudents find 'Qi' by placing their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing them at an angle down to the ground.\n\nHe then asks his students whether they can sense \"qi\"-- a warm feeling or feeling of life in their fingertips, often causing a tingling sensation. Once his students all feel the it, the movement routine can begin.\n\nHe warns that you can easily wave your hands around without really experiencing \"qi,\" and that would completely defeat the purpose of his practice.\n\nThe goal of the movement is to clear blockages, release pain and refresh the body and mind.\n\nSlow and steady\n\nThe movements in qigong are very slow. Students raise their arms over their heads, rotate their wrists, lower their arms and then make circular motions with their hands. Lok says that \"as soon as you get into it, the qi begins to flow.\"\n\nEmotions are also calmed, and people tend to live happier, Lok believes.\n\nOne student slowly works through the Qigong movements.\n\nIn a day and age when wellness is prioritized and dozens of wellness practices sprout daily, with elements of the ancient practice of qigong forming the basis for many of them and studies highlighting the benefits.\n\nRemoving the mystery\n\nCecilia Chan, chair of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the University of Hong Kong, has been studying the effects of qigong for years. Her aim is simple: to demystify the seemingly inexplicable benefits.\n\nThere are a lot of \"misconceptions about qigong,\" said Chan, whose team studies internal qigong, or exercise qigong -- a simple set of movements in which no energy is given to participants through a qigong master; instead, the participants use their own energy to do the movements, similar to other movement practices, like yoga.\n\nThey do not explore external qigong, in which many believe that a qigong master can give you healing energy through hand gestures.\n\nChan believes that qigong can be beneficial to health, especially for those with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nHer team conducted studies on women with chronic fatigue in 2012, concluding that qigong \"may improve chronic fatigue symptoms and mental functioning.\"\n\nThey conducted another study in 2017 to explore whether qigong can reduce depression among women with chronic fatigue. \"From our study, we found that a lot of people after practicing qigong ... become more positive,\" Chan said. \"They become less indulged in their suffering, and they leave the victim's role more readily.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe likens qigong to other mind-body practices like yoga and adds that it \"teaches a philosophy of letting go,\" helping those who practice it to embrace a \"philosophy of let it be ... and be happy with yourself.\"\n\nResearchers at Harvard University have also been exploring the heath aspects of qigong, with their research finding that its practice can help with motor function and depression for individuals with Parkinson's disease.\n\nLok, however, needs no convincing that qigong works on many levels. He witnesses the healing benefits all around him in class. \"There's evidence everywhere that it benefits life in general,\" he said. \"If you have a little time, try qigong. Perhaps you will see the miracle in the qigong, but if you don't try it, there's no chance. ... Find a teacher near you or otherwise go online and start doing something. It's very easy, and the benefit is ever so great.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) What's the secret to living to 100? Some say it's ensuring plenty of exercise ; others point to the benefits of a mild climate . There are even some who suggest that a healthy sex life has plenty do with it.\n\nThe number of peoplewho live to 100 may be relatively small, but it's becoming more common -- particularly in countries like Japan, which has the highest proportion of centenarians in the world.\n\nData from Japan's Ministry of Health estimate that there were 67,824 Japanese people 100 or older as of 2017. In 1965, when the country began recording statistics on its senior citizens, there were just 153 centenarians\n\nAs a result, policymakers in Japan have begun to look at how to cater to those who make it to the 100 club -- and what they find could be of use to the rest of the world in the years to come.\n\nOver the past year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has led a series of meetings at the Council for Designing 100-year Life Society , an expert group set up to prepare for a rise in the number of centenarians.\n\nThe committee has analyzed issues as diverse as reforming social security policy, reappraising what it means to be elderly and diversifying corporate hiring practices.\n\nBut it's not just more centenarians the country is having to prepare for.\n\nChallenges of an aging population\n\nTwenty-seven percent of Japan's population is 65 or older, according to World Bank data . In 1990, that figure was as low as 11%.\n\nWhile living longer is usually a positive, it inevitably creates a number of practical challenges, such as the burden on the state to provide services, pensions and care for an increased number of elderly people. In Japan, this is compounded by a low birth rate, which means there are fewer people of working age to pay for services for the elderly through taxes or work for Japanese companies.\n\nThe number of newborns has fallen for 37 consecutive years in Japan, and the Ministry of Health projects that the population will plummet from its current 126.26 million to 86.74 million by 2060.\n\nA 'multistage' life\n\nAmong those to attend early meetings of Abe's council was Lynda Gratton, professor of management practice at London Business School and co-author of the book \" The 100-Year Life: Living and Working in an Age of Longevity .\"\n\nWhen addressing this issue of aging populations, she says, it's important that governments and businesses \"tell a story\" about how people can begin to live \"multistage lives\" in which they are able to take career breaks and work longer and across numerous fields. This \"narrative\" will help signal the challenges ahead and encourage the conversation on what life in aging societies will look like, Gratton adds.\n\nThe Japanese government has proposed extending the mandatory retirement age for civil servants from 60 to 65. It has also spoken of encouraging \"recurrent education,\" helping people retrain throughout their careers, as well as enabling those who want to work into the later years to do so.\n\nProfessor Hiroko Akiyama of the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology believes these are welcome developments but says the pace of change needs to be faster. \"Our labor force is shrinking, so we have to take drastic measures now,\" she said.\n\nAkiyama points to how job-sharing, flexible working patterns and telecommuting can all play a part in helping more people stay in the workplace longer. The likes of artificial intelligence and robotics, far from reducing job opportunities, can also help seniors work longer by compensating for qualities that people may lose as they get older, such as strength or flexibility, she adds.\n\nBeyond the world of work, health care systems will probably be affected by aging populations and be forced to adapt accordingly. Politics and values could also be begin to change, with elderly people more commonly thought of as more conservative voters.\n\nJUST WATCHED Is a social life the answer to longevity? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is a social life the answer to longevity? 03:07\n\nManaging an aging world\n\nJapan has been one of the most visible nations in addressing these challenges but is far from alone in being affected by them.\n\nThe global population of older persons (those 60 or older) numbered 962 million in 2017, according to the UN World Population Ageing report . That's more than twice as many as in 1980, when there were 382 million older persons worldwide, and the number is expected to double again by 2050, to nearly 2.1 billion.\n\nSouth Korea, Singapore, Aging populations are most pronounced in Europe and North America, according to the report. The US Census Bureau projects that the number of centenarians there will balloon from 86,248 in 2017 to 600,000 by 2060. Yet these issues are also weighing on the likes of Hong Kong Australia and New Zealand\n\nBy 2050, older persons are expected to make up 35% of populations in Europe, 28% in North America, 25% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 24% in Asia, 23% in Oceania and 9% in Africa, the UN report estimates.\n\nGratton points to positive developments in Denmark, which has looked at scenarios for future elderly care, and Singapore, which she says has gone through its policies and removed any suggestions that older people may be less able to perform certain tasks or roles than younger people.\n\nAkiyama, meanwhile, says Japan has been forced to look at the issue earlier than most nations, given the pace at which its population is aging. The country's politicians also seem less eager than others to attract young foreign workers.\n\nAge of opportunity?\n\nYet there could also be opportunity within the challenges of an aging society.\n\nBusinesses in Japan have begun to open fitness clubs that cater to the elderly while robot carers have been introduced to nursing homes , high-value devices that could become lucrative exports.\n\nGratton says Japan is at the forefront of developing robotics and machines that assist the elderly while \"over-55s are spending more than anybody else\" in the country.\n\nHowever, she adds that countries globally must also begin to plan for a future in which the traditional three-stage life of study, work and retirement no longer applies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"People have got to be much more proactive,\" she says.

RODRIGO ARANGUA/AFP/Getty Image\n\nThe Panama Canal, labeled one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the American Society of Civil Engineers, has played a huge role in Panama's evolution.\n\nBefore it existed, ships were forced to navigate around Cape Horn, a hazardous journey near the tip of South America.\n\nAlthough France began the building process back in the late 1800s, the canal was eventually completed in 1914 by the United States, which had been granted control of the 10-mile-wide Canal Zone in exchange for $10 million, as well as annual payments.\n\nThe project wasn't without its costs, both human and financial.\n\nRelated content Berlin: The city where anything goes\n\nMore than $375 million, equivalent to about $8.6 billion today, was spent by the United States to finish it. The bigger price was the five thousand lives lost as a result of diseases or accidents during the US construction period.\n\nWith the canal subsequently owned and operated by America for 70 years, it wasn't until December 1999 that Panama gained complete control of this vital waterway that split the country in half.\n\nToday, more than 15,000 vessels travel through the 82-kilometer canal each year.\n\nIt makes a contribution of up to 40% of Panama's economy, registering a total of $2.238 million in toll revenues during fiscal year 2017 alone.\n\nNew identity\n\nBenaim believes that Panama experienced a rebirth when it was granted free control of the canal.\n\n\"Historically Panama is just over a hundred years old, but it's really only been independent since the Americans left,\" he says.\n\nAbner Benaim: \"Panama is a very young country.\" CNN\n\n\"That's the first time that Panama stood on its own. It's a very young country in that sense. Growing up is hard. Being left alone and being independent is very hard.\"\n\nHowever, Panama has been carving out an identity of its own in the nearly two decades since then.\n\nNowhere is this more prevalent than in Panama City, which is home to around half of the country's residents and the only capital city in the world that holds a rainforest within its city limits.\n\nWhile its old town has been lovingly restored, a gleaming skyline of tower blocks and skyscrapers has emerged victoriously.\n\nThe latter has become a defining point of Panama City.\n\nPanamanian real estate developer Octavio Vallarino played a significant role in modernizing the city and has five buildings under construction.\n\n\"Even though I'm a Panamanian, it impresses me to see the skyline,\" says Vallarino. \"I think it's a reflection of prosperity, a reflection of confidence.\"\n\nThe capital city is also home to Central America's first urban rail system -- the Panama Metro -- which launched in 2014.\n\nHappy place\n\nVallarino is extremely proud of the progress Panama has made, but holds a somewhat controversial viewpoint on the reasons behind this.\n\n\"The invasion by the US gave Panama a good housekeeping seal that makes us one of the safest places in the world,\" he says. \"If the Americans had not been here, Panama would not be what it is today.\n\n\"It's why we have a lot of foreigners that come to live here and do business.

    "text": "Athens (CNN) \u2014 A decade ago, the streets of Athens were in tumult. Protests raged amid clouds of tear gas as the European financial crisis pushed Greece to the brink of financial collapse.\n\nToday, the city's cafes are bustling with cheerful and lively conversation, its art scene is thriving and people seem happy.\n\nHappy because all the drama is over right? Nope, happy because it never ended.\n\n\"Greeks lately are enjoying life a lot because they see that we're going down the drain, and the only way to survive is just to have fun,\" says Pantelis Melissinos , a local craftsman.\n\nKnown as the Poet Sandal Maker for his skills making footwear and writing verse, Melissinos's family has been making sandals in the style of the ancient Greeks since 1920. His grandfather and father also penned plays and poems alongside their day job.\n\nThey've also witnessed the upheaval that regularly visits Athens. The last two centuries have seen coups, invasions, a monarch in exile and more recently, Europe's biggest financial crisis.\n\nThe most recent drama -- \"i krisi\" (the crisis) as it's referred to by locals -- saw Greece teetering towards bankruptcy due to years of overspending. Bailout loans of $300 billion from the European Union and the IMF were needed to keep it afloat.\n\nMaking problems\n\n\"The only way to survive is just to have fun,\" says Pantelis Melissinos. Amanda Sealy/CNN\n\nThe crisis has been a defining moment for the Greek people. A decade full of grinding austerity and civil unrest has made life for many incredibly difficult.\n\nGreeks say they've always suffered misery but they're ingrained with the spirit of making the most of whatever situation they face.\n\nLife goes on and the cafes are busy as ever, with locals sipping strong coffees and discussing Greek politics with a fierceness, a favorite pastime for many.\n\n\"Nothing really has changed I think,\" says Melissinos of his city's past turbulent decade. \"But the Greeks have decided that this is how things are going to be, and they decided to have fun.\n\nRelated content Best of Greece: Beautiful places and tastiest foods\n\n\"You know this is a very Greek way of dealing with a problem. If you cannot beat the problem, you just join the problem. And maybe you become part of the problem. And maybe you give a problem to the problem.\"\n\nIf anyone embodies this very Greek concept of \"making problems for the problem,\" it's Yanis Varoufakis.\n\nThe former economics lecturer was finance minister of Greece for six months during the heady days of 2015 when his austerity-ravaged country was negotiating with its creditors. He unsuccessfully campaigned against accepting a new bailout deal that increased debt levels.\n\nYanis Varoufakis, left, tells Richard Quest that Greece is in a \"permanent coma.\" Amanda Sealy/CNN\n\nTo some Greeks, Varoufakis is now a hero -- a champion of the Greek cause who stood up to the European Union. To others he was a menace, a villainous mischief maker partly responsible for the Greek financial crisis.\n\nVaroufakis points finger of blame elsewhere: \"The lenders and the Greek regime of oligarchs that created the crisis in the first place and have been managing the recovery since 2010.\"\n\nHe adds: \"They put the patient into a permanent coma and called it stability.\"\n\nAnd yet, adds Varoufakis, relaxing in the home overlooking the shimmering sea on the island of Aegina, where he spends his summers plotting against today's establishment, the way the Greek people have handled this adversity offers inspiration.\n\n\"This is a great place to revive your human spirit,\" he says, \"Because if people can have such fun in miserable circumstances, then there is hope for all of us.\"\n\n'We are back'\n\nAthenians say the city's endurance of recent turbulent times prove that its a great place to revive the human spirit\n\nAthens does feel like it's emerging from the dark cloud of the financial crisis. Cafes can charge Parisian prices for a cappuccino, and restaurants are busy with young, aspiring chefs who have brought international flair to traditional Greek cuisine.\n\nVisitors to Greece are expected to number 32 million in 2018, a record year, according to the country's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Many are coming not just to the Greek islands but to Athens too.\n\nThere's also an increase in investors putting their money into the Greek economy.\n\nAn area coined the \"Athens Riviera\" -- a southern suburb of Athens -- is welcoming new upscale hotels. The Four Seasons Astir Palace Hotel is currently under construction and due to open in March 2019.\n\n\"Every year, Athens looks a little better,\" says former mayor Dora Bakoyannis. Amanda Sealy/CNN\n\n\"Every year, Athens looks a little bit better,\" says Dora Bakoyannis, a former Greek foreign minister who served as the city's mayor when it enjoyed its biggest overhaul in modern history in preparation for the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\n\"Today, Athens has tourism which we didn't have for years, which means we are back,\" she adds. \"And we can be back even better with a higher level of tourism, which is what we need.\n\n\"But we have to work for it and we have to have a strategy. Nothing happens if we just wait and say we are the most beautiful country in the world, people will come to us.\"\n\nLiving in a tragedy\n\nPoet Thomas Tsalapatis: \"We live in a tragedy.\" Amanda Sealy/CNN\n\nThe arts scene is also thriving, with many artists priced out of other European capitals now calling Athens home.\n\nCreativity has taken off, welcoming a new generation of artists such as poet Thomas Tsalapatis. Now 34, Tsalapatis saw nearly half of his friends leave a decade ago when the crisis hit. But things have changed and the Athens arts scene is happening, he says.\n\n\"The numbers say that it is true,\" he adds. \"I mean we have many shows, theatrical shows I think more than New York now, like a thousand a year something like that. You have another thousand books published, poetry books published every year. It's a huge number.\"\n\nMajor arts institutions have cropped up in Athens throughout the crisis, mainly funded by the government before the crisis started or donated through private philanthropic organizations.\n\nRelated content 23 ancient cities that have survived more than just time\n\nOverlooking the magical and most famous landmark of Athens is the beautiful glass-covered Acropolis Museum which opened in 2009 (and was mainly funded by the European Union).\n\nThe most recent example of cultural prowess is the massive Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre. It opened in 2016 with five acres of green space surrounding a complex that is home to the Greek National Opera and hosts facilities for the National Library of Greece.\n\nFrom atop the complex, views across the road lead to a harbor full of superyachts and the island of Aegina in the distance.\n\nThough it's a sign of optimism and recovery, poet Tsalapatis is typically Greek about whether or not things have improved overall for the arts in Athens. \"I think now it is not better because we live in a tragedy,\" he said.\n\nPhoenix rising\n\nHow the spirit and traditions of the Greek way of life have carried the city through its tough times\n\nOne unusual twist in the Greek drama of recent times has been the return of members of its royal family. Prince Nikolaos was born in Rome two years after the 1967 military coup which forced his father into exile and led to the abolition of the Greek monarchy.\n\nFive years ago, after never setting foot in the country, Nikolaos moved to Greece with wife Tatiana. The decision prompted mixed reactions among Greeks, but Nikolaos is focused on the positives. The former Fox News journalist is just delighted to be here.\n\n\"I often wake up in the morning, I look out my window and I pinch myself to say how happy I am to be here with [Tatiana],\" he says. \"Because it was a lifelong ambition of mine to move here.\"\n\nPrince Nikolaos and his wife Tatiana moved to Greece five years ago. Ian Gavan/Getty Images\n\nNow working to promote various charities, the couple see themselves as having a key role in helping Greece emerge from the woes of its recent past and waving the flag for their family's homeland, particularly Athens.\n\nRelated content Berlin: The city where anything goes\n\n\"Athens is a city that's booming, a phoenix rising from the ashes,\" says Tatiana. \"There's a lot to discover.

In the steaming hot Hoochie Koo club, the temperature shifts up a couple of extra degrees.\n\nA pair of feather fans hide her nearly naked breasts as she continues her dance. Eventually, even these are cast aside as, with a smile on her face, the act reaches its big reveal.\n\nIt's a typical night in Berlin, a place where, says Pavlova, anything goes.\n\nAs the summer sun sets over the city, it certainly seems that way. The crowds pack into nightclubs like uber-cool Berghain or the bondage and erotica-themed KitKatClub to sweat and grind to some of the planet's hottest techno music.\n\nAnja Pavlova performs a burlesque dance in Berlin. Kevin Broad/CNN\n\nLong after dawn the next morning, they'll scatter through the streets, either rolling into bed to get some rest until the next party starts, or powering on through until night descends once more.\n\nThis is no new phenomenon.\n\nBurlesque dancers were disrobing on stages here back in the 1920s and '30s as part of a scene that inspired the musical \"Cabaret.\" The city's dusk-til-dawn hedonists have always found somewhere to do their thing, no matter what that thing is.\n\nExistential crisis\n\nAside from the dark days when a wall divided the city between the communist East and capitalist West -- and, of course, the darker days of Nazi rule -- laid back Berlin has always been a city that knows how to enjoy itself.\n\nFew cities have been so marked by recent history. A visit to Berlin has to include taking in some of the 20th century troubles.\n\nIt has also long enjoyed a double life. While the city revels in its countercultural cred, Berlin also has a deeply square side. It serves as the capital of the most powerful economy in Europe -- a federal bureaucracy with a reputation for stability and a passion for risk adversity.\n\nRelated content Visiting Berlin? Insiders share tips\n\nThis coexistence is what makes Berlin such an intriguing city to visit, but how does it sustain such a split identity?\n\nCan its bohemian nature survive as hipsterization drives up living costs? And will it weather Germany's wider existential crisis over the record number of migrants and asylum seekers who now call the country, and Berlin in particular, home?\n\nTo understand how Berlin has evolved -- and how it continues to reinvent itself in the face of repeated crisis -- involves diving into its very turbulent history, and meeting the folks who now embody its diverse and irrepressible spirit.\n\nEsra Rotthoff: \"Berliners are less materialistic.\" Barry Neild/CNN\n\n\"Berlin is not Germany,\" says Esra Rotthoff , a photographer who, as a child of a Turkish mother and German father, is about as Berlin as anyone can get. \"It's always been different from the rest of Germany.\"\n\nUnlike other Germans, she says, Berliners typically shy away from materialistic pursuits.\n\nRotthoff should know. She's an artistic collaborator with the Maxim Gorki Theater , a downtown playhouse named after a Soviet author that's known for political productions. The theater's walls are adorned with the deadpan faces of actors photographed by Rotthoff.\n\n\"It's more about what you bring to the city in terms of concepts maybe as an artist, or in terms of ideas,\" she says. \"That's my feeling. That's the general culture... maybe.\"\n\nLive for today\n\nDJ Peggy Gou came to Berlin to master techno music. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nOne of those bringing artistic talent is Peggy Gou , a Korean-born DJ who made techno music powerhouse Berlin her home three years ago. She's one of the latest wave of millennial creatives who have poured into a city now seen as the pinnacle of European cool.\n\n\"When I moved to Berlin,\" Gou tells CNN while spinning vinyl in a corner of hip members club Soho House Berlin . \"I remember, I was on the street. I was trying to ask some questions, but I met no one who was actually from Berlin!\"\n\nFor Gou, Berlin was an education. Working in a record store and frequenting techno clubs like Berghain, she mastered her craft. Now she's a relatively big-name DJ, commanding decent money to play sets around the world.\n\nBurlesque and techno would be odd bedfellows in any other city, but in Berlin it's par for the course.\n\nThe city's biggest lesson? Not surprisingly for a place that's survived two world wars and the isolation of the Berlin Wall, it's the hedonistic mantra of \"live for today.\"\n\n\"Berlin made me understand that you have to be in the right place, for the right DJ, right crowd, right sound system,\" she says.\n\nBut, from the front line of fashion, Gou can sense a change coming as the money pours into her adopted home, professionalizing what was once an underground scene.\n\n\"Three years ago I was like, 'yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm learning a lot, I'm experiencing a lot, I'm still new in the city,'\" she says. \"But now, when people ask me, 'do you like living in Berlin?' I say, 'I like living in Berlin because I'm not there all the time.' \"\n\nAdmittedly, three years is a long time in this city.\n\nIt's barely recognizable from the place that emerged from the collapse of the Berlin Wall -- one side a gray, communist sprawl, the other a garish island of capitalism, lousy with spies. So much so, it's often hard to believe the events that happened here so recently.\n\nOrderly chaos\n\nThe relics of that era still dot the city, Checkpoint Charlie , the TV tower and sections of the Wall like the graffiti-covered East Side Gallery . In the heart of the city, the Brandenburg Gate , once bullet-scarred and hidden behind the Wall, is now a proud symbol of unity.\n\nOverlooking the gate, the posh Hotel Adlon Kempinski , disliked by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler because of its international clientele and left to rot under East German communist rule, has now risen once again. Its modern presidential suite has hosted Britain's Queen Elizabeth -- twice.\n\nLest anyone forget the grimmest of all chapters of Berlin's recent history, a short stroll from Brandenburg is the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe , a bleak and compelling 4.7 acre site covered with a grid of gray concrete slabs.\n\nBerlin's Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nBuilt in 2005 by architect Peter Eisenman, it's attracted complaints from those who say its blocks dehumanize the depravity of the Holocaust. Critics also say it fails to adequately address how and why those victims died.\n\nBut walking through the oppressive center of this memorial, taking its size and scale, visitors might get a fleeting sense of the orderly chaos created by the Nazi machine as, from its seat of power in Berlin, it set out to annihilate millions of men, women and children.\n\nBerlin certainly isn't afraid to confront its past.\n\nRelated content New Berlin Wall section found in Germany\n\nIn the upscale suburb of Wannsee, where locals escape the summer heat to swim in and sunbathe around an idyllic lake, a rather grand villa has, since 1992, been open to the public as another memorial to the terrible crimes of the Nazis.\n\nOn January 20, 1942, the villa -- now known as the House of the Wannsee Conference -- hosted a meeting of 15 Nazi figures including Adolf Eichmann and Reinhard Heydrich as they gathered to discuss their plans for eliminating 11 million Jews across Europe.\n\nThe House of the Wannsee Conference: Idyllic setting for an act of evil. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nThe chilling detachment with which they contemplated mass slaughter stands out in the documents preserved from the event, written in the banal language of middle management.\n\nThere's the initial communication from Heydrich: \"I invite you to attend such a meeting... to be followed by breakfast.\"\n\nThere's also the minutes of the discussion, laying out in no uncertain terms what was wanted. \"In the course of the practical implementation of the Final Solution, Europe will be combed through from west to east.\"\n\nWarnings of the past\n\nStanding in the very room where the nuts and bolts of the Holocaust were decided -- followed by brandy and cigars -- it's hard to conceive how these men could plot the extermination of millions of people.\n\nThe villa's beautiful setting only serves to make the enormity of their actions more incomprehensible.\n\nIt also raises the question: How can a city move on from such evil?\n\nOne remarkable woman who can answer that question is Margot Friedlander , a 96-year-old Holocaust survivor who, despite the persecution, torment and loss inflicted on her before and after World War II, decided to return to Berlin in 2010, decades after moving to New York.\n\nFriedlander survived for one year and three months in hiding in Berlin as the Nazis rounded up the city's Jews, sending many to their deaths in concentration camps. The willingness of non-Jewish Berliners to offer shelter saved her life many times.\n\nMargot Friedlander: \"I still love Berlin.\" Barry Neild/CNN\n\nDespite her age, she's an incredibly active woman, proudly showing a fully booked calendar of speaking engagements, mainly telling young people about her experiences in the hope that a new generation will heed the warnings of the past.\n\nSo why come home?\n\nPartly, Friedlander tells CNN, because she felt a need to speak on behalf of those who perished in the Holocaust -- something she does in her book \"Try to Make Your Life,\" named after her mother's parting instructions as she was taken by the Nazis.\n\nBut also because, she says, for all her experiences, Berlin is her hometown and its people once did their best to spare her a terrible fate.\n\n\"I had a different feeling for Germany because I met Germans who did something that was very, very much forbidden,\" she says. \"It could have cost their head. And this was also part of my decision to come back to Berlin, because I met some good people.\n\n\"And now again, I met wonderful people whom I'm very happy to reach out to because they are grateful [that I] do what I do, to come back. And because they say, 'Here you do belong too.'\"\n\nBourgeois and bohemian\n\nOne consequence of Friedlander's return to Berlin is the recent decision to make her an honorary citizen of the city in recognition for her work. She gleefully points out that she's survived considerably longer than previous recipients of the title.\n\n\"Hitler, Goering and Goebbels were also honorary citizen,\" she says. \"And today a Jewish woman gets to be an honorary citizen.\"\n\nShe adds: \"I still love Berlin and I wish I would be a little younger to be more able to take part of all the things.\"\n\nThose things may or may not include Anja Pavlova's burlesque performance at the Hoochie Koo, a regular night staged in Berlin's Roadrunner Rock & Motor Club.\n\nSituated right by the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin's luxury Hotel Adlon Kempinski has witnessed some of the city's most tumultuous events.\n\nPavlova, a Russian who moved to Berlin in 2017 to tap into the city's exotic cabaret scene, speaks eloquently about how the different sides of the city manage to live alongside each other.\n\nRelated content Abandoned Berlin: The story behind its forgotten places\n\nIn the former West Berlin, \"you have these bourgeois German grandmothers in their furs and pearls,\" Pavlova tells CNN. And 20 minutes away by train in the former East, \"moms at the playground with the tattoos on their necks and dreadlocks ... on their phones and drinking beer in broad daylight while their kids play around naked.\"\n\n\"They just coexist. They just happen. And they don't really influence each other, and that I find the most charming thing about Berlin.\"\n\nCan that coexistence, that winning blend of bourgeois and bohemian -- that sense of openness -- survive as the city continues to gentrify, prices rise and the world moves on?",

    "text": "San Francisco (CNN) \u2014 An icon of the San Francisco Bay Area, the Golden Gate Bridge is more than a means for drivers to cross between the city of San Francisco and Marin County to the north.\n\nA grand presence in California since it first opened after four years of construction in 1937 at a cost of $27 million, the bridge has made its appearance in film (\"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\") and poetry (\"The Changing Light\" by beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti) and contributed to local folklore.\n\nAnd yet it's also a working bridge, with about 200 employees working around the clock maintaining the bridge for more than 100,000 cars crossing daily, as well as pedestrians, bikers and people riding the bridge's ferries and buses.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge DeAgostini/Getty Images\n\nFrom the engineers and ironworkers and electricians who maintain the bridge to the painters who keep it coated in International Orange, there's as much life under and around the bridge as there is moving over it.\n\n\"You get those nice days where it's 75 degrees out here and it's clear, and you can see the Farallons (islands), I could see Alcatraz, I could see the whole city,\" says bridge painter Brian Russell.\"If we have a job on the cables, you get to walk the cables and you're all like, \"you know what I have a pretty cool job.'\"\n\nIronworker Darren McVeigh loves to see the bridge when the sun is rising or setting. \"When the moon is behind the bridge in the morning, it's really nice and it's really calm, clear skies. It's just a beautiful, beautiful sight,\" he said. \"My favorite part is just to be able to say that I work on the Golden Gate Bridge. I love it out here.\"\n\nCNN Travel spent a day climbing into and around the bridge, learning these 10 secrets from the people who know and love it best.\n\n1. Why is it called the Golden Gate Bridge? It's not golden.\n\nUnder the bridge Channon Hodge/CNN\n\n\"The Golden Gate Bridge gets its name because it spans what is called the Golden Gate Strait,\" said Paolo Cosulich-Schwartz, spokesman for the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, which operates the bridge.\n\n\"It's a three-mile-long and one-mile wide body of water that connects the Pacific Ocean to the San Francisco Bay.\n\n\"The bridge had been an idea since the mid-19th century but people thought that it was impossible to build. The waters were too rough and too deep.\"\n\n2. What color is the bridge? It looks red.\n\nInternational Orange close up. Channon Hodge/CNN\n\nIt's not red, although you're not crazy to think so. Visitors \"all call it red,\" said Russell.\n\nBack in the day, the US Navy, then part of the War Department, oversaw the waterways and wanted to paint this bridge black and yellow for high visibility, like a bumblebee, said fellow painter Jarrod Bauer.\n\nAs the bridge was being erected in the 1930s, the steel brought to construct the bridge had a coat of red lead on it. The husband-and-wife architect team of Irving and Gertrude Morrow liked that color against the landscape here, Bauer said.\n\nThey ended up mixing paint to create the color International Orange, which is similar to the color of red lead, he said.\n\n\"When we're working on this side people will want us to paint their shoes, or their jackets,\" said Russell. \"They're all, 'Can you put some paint on me?'\"\n\n3. Can I paint my house the same color?\n\nDo you really want to? We can't predict your family's reaction to International Orange -- never mind the neighbors -- but yes, you can. Copy the paint formula listed on the bridge's website -- it's free! -- and take it to your local paint store.\n\n\"Download the color matrix or scheme, and actually go to your paint shop and have them mix it for you,\" says Cosulich-Schwartz. \"You can paint whatever you like International Orange.\"\n\n4. Does the bridge get entirely painted every year?\n\nNope, and it doesn't need to be.\n\nIt's true that the top coat has been fully repainted over time with new and environmentally-improved International Orange top coats.\n\nHowever, there are ares that haven't been stripped to bare metal and completely repainted, said Bauer.\n\n5. What gets painted?\n\nThe bridge area being painted is sectioned off. Channon Hodge/CNN\n\nEvery two years, the bridge's engineers conduct an inspection of every inch of the bridge, Cosulich-Schwartz said. \"That creates a work plan for where we need to do painting\" and other maintenance work required to keep the bridge in good working condition.\n\nOnce a work plan is developed from those inspections, the painters know where they'll paint next. Then the bridge's ironworkers will rig up scaffolding to create the job site. They create containment areas for painters to change into and out of their protective gear. The areas also keep contaminants getting outside to the public, which are sometimes traveling just a few feet from the job site.\n\nThat's when the painters start sandblasting the area to be painted to remove all of the old paint. Then they prime the area to a thickness of 10 milliliters, followed by an intermediate coat and two top coats. (It can take months, depending on the size of the area.)\n\n6.How long will the paint last?\n\nFor the most part, however, \"we're hoping to get 25, 30 years of life out of this paint job,\" said Bauer.\n\nIt depends on which part of the bridge is being painted and how exposed it is to the elements. \"There are certain parts of the bridge that still have lead paint on them that don't need to be painted yet,\" said Bauer. \"The lead paint was a good paint as far as holding up in integrity of the paint.\"\n\n7. What's that sound I hear on a foggy day?\n\nAaron Kozlowski, chief opperating engineer at the Golden Gate Bridge Channon Hodge/CNN\n\nIt's the bridge's unique ring tone, created by four fog horns using 80 pounds of air pressure to blast 165 decibels of sound. With a range of up to six miles, it's activated when it's too foggy for ships' crews to see the bridge.\n\nOf course, it's a backup: Ships have their own GPS systems, and specially trained local ship's pilots direct the large container ships through the strait. But no one wants to take a chance with the damage large ships could do to the bridge.\n\n\"The fog can be so thick here you cannot see maybe 15 feet in front of you,\" said Aaron Kozlowski, the bridge's chief operating engineer. \"The fog horn stays on during that set pattern until we call it, until an employee here notices and says, 'Hey, the fog's cleared.'\"\n\nThe bridge staff tried to use automated systems to turn on the fog horns, but the salt air damaged the equipment.\n\n8. Who performs bridge rescues?\n\nMcVeigh and his fellow ironworkers, the so-called \"Cowboys of the Sky,\" have that responsibility. McVeigh has lost count of how many troubled souls he's been called to rescue over the past 17 years.\n\nIf people aren't willing to listen to police officers, they send the ironworkers out to go over the rail and get them. \"We'll set up a high line, tie off, go over the rail, and then we just start walking in slowly to them, and start talking to them ourselves, to try to get them to come back over the rail.\"\n\nMcVeigh will soon have help.\n\nIn September in 2018, the bridge started constructing a suicide deterrent system , also known as the safety net, to keep people from jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. While it's designed to catch people who try to jump off, its very existence becomes a deterrent, bridge officials said.\n\nIt's expected to be completed in 2021.\n\n9. Does the bridge really have a poem?\n\nActually, it has two, both written by Joseph P. Strauss, who submitted preliminary sketches for the Golden Gate Bridge in 1921 and served as chief engineer during construction. He attended the official opening of the bridge to automobile traffic in May 28, 1937 but died the following May of coronary thrombosis in Los Angeles.\n\nUpon the completion of the bridge, he wrote \"The Mighty Task is Done\" and \"The Golden Gate Bridge.\"\n\nIf you visit the bridge\n\nThe Lodge at the Presidio has a firepit with a view. Paul Dyer\n\nThis isn't really a secret: It's easy to walk or bike on the Golden Gate Bridge if you're visiting the San Francisco Bay Area. It's also fun to ride the ferry, which is also operated by the Golden Gate Bridge, for a ride across the strait. (Just avoid rush hour.)\n\nNational Park Service aficionados will enjoy a visit to Crissy Field to spot the bridge and play in the grassy area, which is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area , the second most popular NPS area in the country last year.\n\nThere's farm to table cuisine nearby at the Presidio , a former military base turned National Park Service site. Chef Traci Des Jardin has opened the Spanish-influenced The Commissary with Eric Minnich as executive chef. (A salute to the bridge, the International Orange cocktail is a mix of gin, ros\u00e9, pamplemousse, grapefruit bitters and soda.)\n\nWant to sleep with a view of bridge? The Presidio is now is home to the Lodge at the Presidio and Inn at the Presidio . Make sure to ask for a room with a view.",

    "text": "Los Angeles (CNN) \u2014 Tea has an image problem in the US, and there's an Angeleno trying to fix that.\n\nJosh Zad, a Los Angeles native, is the founder of Alfred Tea (named for the butler in Batman), and he is ready to change your mind about tea.\n\nThis isn't your grandmother's hot cup of water and tea bag kind of tea. This is the real deal, and Zad, who enlisted the help of a tea consultant to legitimize his offerings, has gone to great lengths to ensure that the Alfred Tea experience is different, unexpected and absolutely delicious.\n\nZad asked me to meet him at Alfred Tea's second location in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles (the first LA spot is going strong on Melrose Place) on opening day in September 2018.\n\nThe drinks are colorful and pretty, but Alfred Tea prides itself on using quality ingredients and teas as well. Mary Costa\n\n\"This is probably the thirtieth drink we've made all day,\" Jordan G. Hardin, the company's food and beverage director said, pointing out that my iced matcha with coconut milk was approximately \"lucky number 30.\"\n\nThe shop is an Instagram story's dream (even without the pink balloons out front celebrating its debut), and Zad openly embraces the trend of people posting pictures of their pretty little drinks on the visually-driven social media platform.\n\n(At the time of this writing, Alfred Tea's Instagram following is a not-too-shabby 66.9K.)\n\n\"I figured if I can get people in here for a cup and for the photo opportunity, Jordan can sell them on the world of tea \u2014 that it's more than what you imagined.\" If they can accomplish that, Zad's pretty confident they'll come back for more.\n\nBoth Zad and Hardin agree that tea deserves its time in the spotlight. Coffee easily commands respect, but there's room for tea they say (even if they admit they may be a little ahead of the curve).\n\nWhile Hardin is busy perfecting the craft \u2014 the tea offerings themselves \u2014 Zad's paying attention to the overall look and feel of the shop. Outfitting it in pink tile, cool d\u00e9cor, trendy sayings and items for purchase, Alfred Tea is memorable.\n\nBut first, coffee\n\nWhile you may have seen this catchy phrase before (a coffee shop in this writer's Brooklyn neighborhood frequently displays it on its chalkboard), it is, in fact, trademarked and belongs to Alfred coffee.\n\nCoffee is the first thing many of us want in the morning, and it's also the first beverage that Zad built a business around.\n\nIn spite of, or maybe because of, coffee's stronghold in the US \u2014 unlike tea, it's reputation tends to be strong \u2014 entering the coffee game was a bit risky, Zad will admit. There are no shortage of coffee shops, especially in a city like Los Angeles.\n\nRelated content These may be the best tacos in L.A.\n\nIn Silver Lake, on Los Angeles's Sunset Boulevard alone, there are at least half a dozen \"boutique coffee shops\" to choose from. Zad acknowledges it's a \"coffee mecca.\" And yet on a recent visit, Alfred was packed inside and out. Credit the cool vibes, the expertly made drinks or the now-ubiquitous avocado toast, the LA cafes are consistently abuzz.\n\nBut with the coffee market in Los Angeles somewhat cornered \u2014 it may not be as pervasive as Starbucks, but you don't have to wander far before you stumble into a shop hawking fair trade beans \u2014 Zad decided to turn his attention to something that was beginning to seem obvious to him, even if it wasn't so obvious to everyone else.\n\nAlfred Tea's motto is cute and a little punk all at once. Mary Costa\n\nThe more tea drinks that Alfred coffee made, the closer Zad came to the vision of the LA tea house. He brought in Hardin to help see it through.\n\nHardin, who has worked in the food and beverage industry since he was a kid, says that beverages is where he really found his focus. When he saw the job listing for tea consultant, he thought \"this is amazing.\" He came in to consult, and the two developed a vision of a modern, urban tea house.\n\nNow Hardin, whose knowledge of tea is indeed vast, oversees the development, training and menu-building at Alfred Tea Room. He was an integral part in the company's expansion to Japan.\n\nTea yes, you maybe\n\nThe tea house's motto is cheeky, cute, a little punk \u2014 just right, according to Zad.\n\nHe says it's gone over well in the LA locations, but notes that it's really taken off in Japan: \"There's been a decade-long trend of female empowerment [in Japan] and making sure there's equal status and so on. So they've taken it, since it is a little more pink and a little more feminine, they've taken it to be kind of this empowerment motto.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, people are having more fun with the motto, but the tea itself is actually quite serious, which is not to say that it's inaccessible.\n\nThe Brentwood location opened in September 2018; it is just down the street from an Alfred coffee. Mary Costa\n\nYou won't find any snooty baristas or tea gurus in Alfred. Says Zad, \" I want the barista to be like, 'Have you been here before? What's your preference? What do you normally order?'\"\n\nHe wants there to be a conversation, wants people to discover new teas and flavors and even side effects of drinking tea.\n\nWhile the healing properties of tea are somewhat well known, Hardin's goal is to get people to drink it on the regular \u2014 not just when they're in a health-conscious mood.\n\nHardin's guidance is this: \"Start your day with coffee, and then just switch to matcha later in the day, and you'll be fine. You'll be great.\"\n\nWhat he means by this is that by making the switch from caffeine to theanine (the alpha wave brain-boosting chemical that physically relaxes you), you avoid the crash that many coffee drinkers are all too familiar with.\n\nThe tea houses are filled with cool d\u00e9cor and trendy sayings. Mary Costa\n\nAnd it's a convincing argument: \"I can drink matcha all day and be alert, be focused, and never crash. It's just a good feeling,\" says Hardin.\n\nPlus, it's delicious.\n\nBut matcha, Hardin believes, is just the beginning. Hardin wants to introduce woul-be tea consumers to the other four pillars of tea as well: Kombucha, Hot & Iced Tea, Chai/Tea lattes, and Milk Tea/Boba. \"Milk Tea and Boba typically go hand in hand, but many enjoy Milk Tea without Boba, which is an optional add-on,\" he explains.\n\nHardin says there are a lot of great boba places in LA, and given the city's strong Asian communities, who've been drinking boba tea for decades, standing out as a quality place to get boba among the discerning Asian community is no small feat. And neither is convincing new groups of people, especially ones who aren't sold on tea in the first place, that boba isn't just a trendy phenomenon.\n\nAlfred Tea Room's strategy is to create boba tea that's really special. Each batch, which takes an hour to make, is created with high-end freshly brewed teas and no syrups.\n\nDrink to this\n\nBut Zad isn't satisfied with just fixing tea's image problem. He's got other plans, and they involve Mexican beer.\n\n\"I've had this idea for a while that no one does anything really exciting in the beer space,\" Zad explains. His response was to develop Calidad Beer. The word Calidad means simply \"quality,\" and it's a Mexican-style beer made in California -- which is to say it's a basic, easy-drinking lager.\n\nThe pair believes that the IPA craze \u2014 super hoppy, bitter beers \u2014 will be coming to an end soon, and in its place, they'll be offering a beer that \"tastes like Pacifico,\" aka light and refreshing.\n\nIt's wholesale-only, though there'll be a tasting room in West Hollywood when it launches this month.\n\nFirst there was coffee, then there was tea, and now there's beer. It may not seem like the perfect trifecta at quick glance, but Zad isn't concerned. \"People trust me with Alfred now, so I'm saying I'm making Mexican beer. What's the worst than can happen?\"\n\nPart of Zad's confidence stems from the fact that he knows his city. He grew up in Beverly Hills and was determined to open an Alfred there, even though brokers suggested that he was crazy based on previous businesses' failure to succeed in the neighborhood. He persisted, trusting his familiarity and instinct: \"I'm born and raised in LA. I know it like the back of my hand.\"\n\nHe never considered launching his business anywhere but his hometown.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 If you've tried one dish that hails from Vietnam , it's most likely pho.\n\nMade with rice noodles, the beef noodle soup is a must-try on the streets of Vietnam -- not to mention readily available overseas. But there's much more to Vietnam's diverse noodle scene than this familiar food.\n\nHiding in plain sight of travelers is another delicious noodle dish: bun, as surprising, variable and seductive as jazz.\n\nThe joys of b\u00fan\n\nRelated content Egg coffee? Why this Hanoi specialty has everyone rushing for a caffeine fix\n\nIn Vietnamese, \"b\u00fan\" refers to rice vermicelli. It's basically Asian spaghetti. It's slurpable and versatile, with endless combinations that make it taste new every time. You can eat bun with fish sauce or tomato broth, snails or grilled meats, wrapped in a spring roll, or woven into mini-b\u00fan blankets of joy in the form of banh hoi.\n\n\"What I love about the variety of Vietnamese noodle dishes is that while they may have some crossovers in ingredients and herbs, they often have totally different compositions, and certain ingredients that truly make each noodle dish special,\" Mark Wiens, a \"full time travel eater\" who runs the Migrationology food travel blog, tells CNN.\n\nBroth basics\n\nOf course, all noodle dishes aren't created equal. According to Helen Le, the host of Helen's Recipes on YouTube, the best way to judge a noodle dish is by examining and tasting the broth and fish sauce.\n\n\"The best broth is clear -- (in Vietnam), we don't like cloudy broth s ,\" says Le.\n\nThe clearer it is, the better the balance of flavors -- salty, sweet, sour and bitter -- which is essential to a good dish. Ready to slurp some soup? Here are five dishes that showcase the best of Vietnam's bun noodles and where to try it in Hanoi, the capital city:\n\n1. B\u00fan ri\u00eau\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about B\u00fan ri\u00eau -- a meat or seafood vermicelli soup -- is its red hue. Dan Tham\n\nB\u00fan ri\u00eau is a meat or seafood vermicelli soup with a distinctive crimson color. The broth gets its appearance from tomato paste and annatto oil, made from achiote tree seeds.\n\nFreshwater crabmeat and blanched tomatoes are the soup's star players. Tamarind paste lends sourness to the broth, while airy bits of fried tofu contribute crunch.\n\nDepending on the region, b\u00fan ri\u00eau might also come topped with beef, pork, snails or fish. Vermicelli noodles swim in the soup, adding balance to a dish that's both colorful and light. Add to that the requisite plateful of lime wedges, chili and greens -- like banana blossoms and mint -- and you have a perfect meal.\n\nWhere to try it in Hanoi: B\u00fan ri\u00eau street stall run by Ms. Thu, located in Th\u1ecd X\u01b0\u01a1ng Alley, near St. Joseph's Cathedral\n\n2. B\u00fan ch\u1ea3\n\nA cold noodle dish, b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 features hunks of charcoal-grilled fatty pork. Dan Tham\n\nB\u00fan ch\u1ea3 is a local lunchtime obsession in Hanoi. A cold noodle dish, b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 features hunks of charcoal-grilled fatty pork -- cha -- bathing in a blend of the ubiquitous fish sauce, vinegar, lime and sugar.\n\nVermicelli noodles, fruits and veggies, such as carrots and green papaya, accompany the glorious pork.\n\nWhere to try it in Hanoi: B\u00fan ch\u1ea3 C\u1eeda \u0110\u00f4ng, 41 C\u1eeda \u0110\u00f4ng Street, Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District; +84 90 458 1964\n\n3. B\u00fan c\u00e1 H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng\n\nOne of the most popular dishes in Haiphong is b\u00fan c\u00e1, literally meaning \"fish noodles.\" Dan Tham\n\nOn the way to the Pandora-like islands of Ha Long Bay, you'll pass Hai Phong, one of Vietnam's most important seaports and, by extension, one of the best places in the country for seafood.\n\nBun ca Hai Phong, literally \"fish noodles of Hai Phong,\" is much subtler than other, more flamboyant Vietnamese dishes.\n\n\"It's the contrast of textures that makes this dish interesting,\" says Le.\n\nThe fish -- usually mackerel, carp, or catfish -- is pounded into fishcakes then deep-fried. Traces of dill, tomatoes, green onions and perilla -- a mint-like herb -- combine for a light meal.\n\nWhere to try it in Hanoi: An Bi\u00ean, 111 Tri\u1ec7u Vi\u1ec7t V\u01b0\u01a1ng in Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng District; +84 4 3974 0571\n\n4. Ch\u1ea3 c\u00e1\n\nCh\u1ea3 c\u00e1 brings together vermicelli noodles with turmeric-spiced catfish.

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Walk down any street in Vietnam , and it quickly becomes apparent this is a country that's crazy about coffee. From people sipping and sitting on low plastic stools on the sidewalk while gossiping with friends, to those who prefer the pricier, hipster-style cafes popping up around Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, the need for caffeine is inescapable.\n\nEveryone at Hanoi's humble Cafe Giang however, is after something more than just a caffeine fix. They've come for \"c\u00e0 ph\u00ea tr\u00fang,\" or egg coffee, a Hanoi specialty in which a creamy soft, meringue-like egg white foam is perched on dense Vietnamese coffee.\n\nWhile destinations across the city now serve it, this cafe claims to have invented it.\n\nThere are hot and cold versions. The former is served as a a yellow concoction in a small glass. It's consumed with a spoon and tastes almost like a coffee flavored ice cream -- more like a dessert than coffee.\n\nThe hot version comes resting in a small dish of hot water to maintain its temperature. The strong coffee taste at the bottom of the cup seeps through the egg -- the yellow layer on top -- and is quite thick and sweet, though not sickly.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nA family secret\n\nCafe Giang is packed on both levels and in the center of the premises, at the bridge between the lower and upper levels, sits Nguyen Van Dao, keeping track of the plentiful orders in a large notebook and giving orders to those serving.\n\nBehind him, there's a modest, open-plan kitchen where a modern, red mixing machine is whirring constantly, whisking up eggs and other parts of the recipe. Van Dao visibly swells with pride when asked about the cafe's most famous drink.\n\nHe says it was his father, Nguyen Van Giang who invented the recipe while working as a bartender at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel in 1946. At the time, there was a shortage of fresh milk in the country so whisked egg yolk was used as a substitute.\n\n\"All the foreigners and the Vietnamese in the hotel liked it,\" says Van Dao. \"So he decided to leave the hotel to start selling egg coffee and create his own brand.\"\n\nWhen pushed on the recipe Van Dao begins listing the ingredients while counting on his fingers.\n\n\"Egg, condensed milk, coffee powder, some butter, some cheese... but I can't tell you everything, it's a secret recipe\" he chuckles.\n\n'I've never had a client not like it'\n\nMark Lowerson, who runs Street Eats Hanoi, takes tourists from all over the globe on food tours and says egg coffee always goes down well.\n\n\"For the vast majority of our clients, the egg coffee experience is a revelation\" he says. \"The wow factor is high. When I start describing it, they can't put two and two together. 'Egg' and 'coffee', together? It's pretty hard to get a coherent image of those two ingredients in a cup together. It's always fun.\n\n\"I've never had a client not like it. Most devour it and swear they're coming back for one every day they're in Hanoi. Even people who are not normally coffee drinkers can be surprised.\n\nThat said, he admits some people find it too rich to finish. \"It is a very decadent way to get a caffeine hit, let's face it.\"\n\nVietnamese coffee culture\n\nInfluenced by the Chinese, who ruled the country for 1,000 years, traditionally Vietnam was a tea-drinking nation.\n\nSo what makes coffee so popular today?\n\nRelated content Vietnam by motorcycle: History and culture on two wheels\n\n\"I can't really answer that with complete confidence, but I do believe it started with French influence, which makes sense given the popularity of bread and cheese,\" says Will Frith, a specialty coffee consultant who has worked n in Dalat in the central highlands of Vietnam.\n\n\"The French introduced coffee to Vietnam, mainly as a way to supply their own colonial expat populations. As Vietnam became influenced by other economic forces and collaborators from Europe -- the French in 1860s through the early 20th century and the Germans mid-century, which opened them up to instant coffee production -- coffee started to make its way into cities, where popularity has increased ever since.\"\n\nNowadays coffee culture is very much entwined in Vietnamese life.\n\n\"The older generation prefer to sit at sidewalk cafes, smoke cigarettes and socialize,\" explains Frith. \"Many will sip on coffee all day long. The younger generation is into the more European-influenced cafe experience, going out to be seen in cafes and to socialize with friends. Many of these cafes are decorated like discotheques, with loud club music to match.\"\n\nAs for some of the new coffee trends in Vietnam, Frith says there's a growing interest in all things natural and specialty.\n\n\"Hand-crafted goods, elegant presentation and novel experiences are sought after and specialty cafes are popping up all over Ho Chi Minh City, with other cities also starting to see a little activity in this segment,\" he says.\n\n\"Anything mixed or blended with milk and sugar will find an enthusiastic audience.\" Something that Cafe Giang's Van Dao knows all too well.\n\n\"I feel very honored and happy to have so many tourists come here and know our brand,\" he says, motioning to his packed cafe full of both locals and tourists.\n\nSo what makes his egg coffee stand out from the others offering the same drink across the capital?\n\n\"The difference is in the recipe,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"Many others have tried to copy it but the taste is just not the same.\"\n\nOther Hanoi cafes to get an egg coffee fix\n\nDinh Cafe\n\nOwned by Mr Van Dao's sister, this is perhaps the second best place in Hanoi to savor some c\u00e0 ph\u00ea tr\u00fang and features views of Hoan Kiem lake.\n\n13 Dinh Tien Hoang, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi; +84 (0)4 3824 2960\n\nOriberry Coffee\n\nSelling Fair Trade coffee by utilizing farmers co-operatives from regions throughout Vietnam to provide poor farmers with better working conditions and incomes, Oriberry has two locations in the city.\n\n25 Xuan Dieu, Tay Ho, Hanoi; +84 (0)4 6275 8669\n\n36 Au trieu, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi; +84 (0)4 6275 8669\n\nLeu Coffee\n\nQuirkily decorated, this cafe/bar with an underground vibe draws mostly a local crowd and serves great coffee and drinks.\n\n2nd Floor, No.1, Ta Hien Street, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi; +84 (0)98 453 03 82\n\nLoading T\n\nSet in a gorgeous colonial mansion, Loading T is perhaps one of the most charming spots to grab a cup of coffee in the city.

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Diwali is one of the most important Hindu festivals in India , but the colorful customs and meanings associated with it can vary depending on where you travel in the country.\n\nIn the north, Diwali is often a raucous affair, marked by a cacophony of firecrackers on the streets and a flourish of ceremonial gambling in the home.\n\nThe wealthier urban dwellers splurge on gold, jewelry, clothes and expensive gifts such as electronics, which they buy for themselves and their loved ones.\n\nIn the quiet villages, such as those dotted around the vast state of Maharashtra in the west of India, the Festival of Lights celebration is generally a simpler affair, defined by humble offerings and wholesome feasts.\n\nFew, if any, firecrackers are burst and many follow their own particular tribal traditions. Most villagers try to buy new clothes, but few can afford gold, jewelry or elaborate gifts.\n\nThe annual dates of Diwali are as fluid as types of revelry you'll find. It's generally celebrated for five days, with the biggest day being the third one.\n\nIn 2018, northern India marks that day on Wednesday, November 7. However, it falls on Tuesday, November 6, in southern India, where it's called Deepavali.\n\nHere's a look at some of the most popular ways to celebrate.\n\nCommon traditions\n\nSome Diwali rituals are common across most of the subcontinent.\n\nIn both city and countryside, small oil lamps made of clay (diyas) are placed at the thresholds of homes, shops and offices throughout the five-day affair to celebrate the legend of the return of the Hindu god, Lord Rama, to his kingdom after 14 years in exile. According to mythology, his people lit diyas to welcome his return.\n\nIn villages, the rangolis are sometimes drawn on top of fresh cow dung. AFP/Getty Images\n\nHindus in cities and villages also believe that during Diwali the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, will visit their homes if they are lit, clean and beautifully decorated.\n\nWindows and doors are left open to let the goddess in, and homes are cleaned from top to bottom.\n\nBrightly colored rangolis are drawn using fingers on the ground at the entrances to homes and offices. These geometric designs are usually symbols of nature. Their purpose is to welcome guests and to encourage Lakshmi inside.\n\nRelated content 6 things you should know about Diwali\n\nGambling card games are often played in villages and cities, as it is generally considered auspicious to gamble during Diwali.\n\nThis springs from a legend that a Hindu deity played a dice game with his consort on the fourth day of Diwali and she won. Some Hindus believe Lakshmi can be invoked through gambling.\n\nPlace your bets\n\nGambling parties are an especially popular pastime during Diwali in Mumbai. The parties typically start at 10 p.m. in bungalows and farmhouses and continue until 5 a.m.\n\n\"People don't mind losing -- it's part of the ambiance and people are having fun,\" says Vikram Mehta, founder of Red Om Entertainment in Mumbai. \"Everyone dresses up, everyone is on holiday, everyone is inviting each other to their homes, there is a lot of warmth.\"\n\nVarious games are played. The most popular is Teen Patti (three-card brag), and blackjack and poker are also favorites.\n\n\"People sit on mattresses on the floor. There are rooms where the kids play for fun and then other rooms with the higher stakes,\" Mehta says. The houses are decorated with diyas, people dress in traditional Indian dress, servants wander around with platters of kebabs, biryani and Indian sweets, he adds.\n\nAcross the country, Indian sweets -- known as mithai -- are exchanged and people have large family gatherings in their homes.\n\nNew year, new accounts\n\nDiwali marks the start of the new Hindu financial year and many businesses open new accounts books. AFP/Getty Images\n\nDiwali also marks the start of the new Hindu financial year, and many businessmen, traders and shopkeepers open new account books. Business people in certain states, particularly Gujarat, worship their account books.\n\nThere are various other rituals celebrated in towns and villages on each of the five days. For example, on the last day of Diwali in many parts of India, a sister cooks for her brother and he bestows gifts on her in celebration of the love between siblings.\n\n\"The modern world is changing, and festivals are the only way to keep our culture and traditions alive. For us, Diwali is the victory of good over evil, the returning of good back into our lives and starting a new year with a positive approach and forgetting all the bad that has happened,\" says Mumbai housewife Heena Damle.\n\n\"You have tables ready with sweets to offer if someone comes to your home,\" adds her nephew Pranav Damle.\n\nLighting up the night\n\nTypically firecrackers are set off from dusk, often throughout the night. The noise is believed to herald the defeat of evil and catch the attention of the gods.\n\nRag picker Santosh, whose family migrated from a Maharashtrian village to Mumbai, says: \"People in the villages have limited means, so it's not very spectacular. In Mumbai, the rich celebrate it with a lot of pomp. We witness huge fireworks and can get such fancy crackers.\"\n\nSome, however, are concerned that the original traditions of Diwali are being lost in cities.\n\nInir Pinheiro is managing director of Grassroutes , which promotes responsible village tourism, and takes urban Indians on trips to tribal villages. He says many of them want to \"see an unadulterated way of celebrating Diwali, a less noisy place and to reconnect with the people.\"\n\n\"I think people in the cities are beginning to realize there is a lot of show in the way it is celebrated and a large materialistic aspect to it. People want to see if there is something more to the celebration,\" Pinheiro says.\n\nRelated content India's 30 most beautiful places\n\nHopes for the harvest\n\nIn the 500-person village of Purushwadi in Maharashtra, families of five typically live in stone houses of two bedrooms. Dutta Kondar, a farmer from the Mahadeo Koli tribe, says that Diwali is a \"celebration of the end of the harvest of kharif (rain-fed crops).\"\n\nSince harvest is when the villagers make money, villagers carry out Lakshmi puja (prayer ritual) on their assets at Diwali, giving thanks and praying for a good harvest to come.\n\n\"We conduct a small puja of our cattle, grain and cash,\" Kondar says. Family members hold a plate of offerings to the gods and chant prayers while rotating the plate around the assets, he explains.\n\n\"To make sure our bodies are prepared for the winter, we eat lots of oil and sweets,\" Kondar adds.\n\n\"Whenever anyone enters their house, the villagers offer each other sweets. But they don't buy presents for each other -- money being a big constraint,\" Pinheiro says.\n\nVillage values\n\nLike many rural villages across India, Purushwadi has its own particular rituals. Pinheiro says one of the most popular is the local singing ceremony.\n\n\"This is when children go round the houses holding hand-made lanterns made of sticks and twigs and they sing Marathi songs for the benefit of residents of the homes. In return they are given oil and grain,\" Pinheiro says.",

This reckless act will leave your face as red as the dish.\n\nLee Kang-sun Silbijip, founded over 45 years ago, has four spiciness levels.\n\nThe restaurant is in the Mugyo-dong district in Jongno-gu. The area has been synonymous with the classic spicy dish since the '60s and '70s.\n\nSocial heat: If you're willing to let your companion see you during this meal -- with your red face and belly bulging with liquids you drank to dilute the spice -- it's true friendship.\n\nHave your stomach suffer at:\n\nLee Kang-soon Silbijip, 75-1, Cheonggyecheon-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul; +82 2 737 7880\n\n2. Jjambbong (Seafood noodles)\n\nSpice rating: 4/5\n\nThe first thing you're told when you sit down for jjambbong (a ridiculously hot seafood-based noodle dish) is to eat the noodles first.\n\nOnce you hit the broth, infused with four different chilies from Korea, China, Vietnam and India, the fire becomes too fierce to put out through standard means.\n\nOne mouthful of noodles is enough to cause acute pain on the tongue.\n\nAdd a spoonful of broth and your entire head may feel that it's been set on fire.\n\nThe version served at Shingildong Spicy Jjambbong is immensely rich.\n\nI found myself dabbling dangerously into the soup and noodles even as I experienced gut-wrenching pain.\n\nA sign in the restaurant politely requests customers to use the restaurant's bathroom if they feel the need to throw up, rather than purge themselves on the street.\n\nThe stack of milk cartons in front of the famed noodle shop is testament to the satanic levels of spice inside.\n\nSocial heat: Expect some bonding over the noodles as you watch each other wince and writhe in pain.\n\nIf you need to make amends with colleagues at work, invite them out for a team-building experience.\n\nCry for your mama at:\n\nShingildong Spicy Jjambbong, 10-1, 62 Road, Singil-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul; +82 10 5395 1151\n\n1. Onnuriye Donkatsu (Pork cutlet)\n\nThose who finish the Drop-Dead Donkatsu inside 20 minutes get their face on the Wall of Fame. Jiyeon Lee /CNN\n\nSpice rating: 5/5\n\nThe innocent restaurant name, Onnuriye Donkatsu (\"Pork Cutlet Around the World\"), is deceiving.\n\nThis place is actually known for serving the Donkatsu of Death, aka the Drop-Dead Donkatsu, by far the spiciest dish I've ever endured.\n\nThe pork cutlet is drenched in an ominous dark red sauce made from a rich broth of Asian herbs and what owner Song Jung-won claims is the spiciest chili on earth.\n\nSong keeps the recipe for his over-the-top sauce a close secret.\n\n\"I want to make it the utmost difficult challenge for only 0.1 percent of the population,\" he says.\n\n\"There's something about the spiciness that draws people to it even though they're in pain. They usually think 'how spicy could it possibly be?'\"\n\nOne thumb-sized slice of the donkatsu was enough to make me give up.\n\nThe restaurant dares diners to eat the Drop-Dead Donkatsu within 20 minutes, but be warned: They won't serve the dish unless you bring a carton of milk with you.\n\nThe brave few -- and they are few -- who complete the challenge get their face on the Wall of Fame.\n\nSocial heat: There won't be any conversation after a bite of this dish. Come alone, or with someone you wish to hurt.\n\nFind out how worthless and weak you really are at:\n\nOnnuriye Donkatsu, 355-23 Sindaebang 2-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul; +82 2 823 8589\n\nHow to handle spicy food\n\nEat something before the real meal. Just as you are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol when you haven't eaten, spice can attack an empty stomach.\n\nPrepare the right drink. When it comes to alleviating the pain of spicy food, water is no help. It only rolls the spice around in your mouth and momentarily relieves the pain.\n\nMilk or other dairy drinks help take the heat out of your mouth and also comfort your burning stomach.\n\nPlan ahead. The effects of spicy food can linger long after actual consumption.\n\nEmbarking on a spice challenge when you have an important meeting, exam or travel plans coming up is not a bright idea. You never quite know when the afterburn will kick in.\n\nPick the right companion. Spicy food can cripple your social skills.\n\nYou're not exactly charming when your eyes are watering, you're blowing your nose every three seconds and the only sound you can produce is a groan of pain.\n\nConsume heat only with friends who understand that sometimes we all need a good cry.\n\nDon't be overly ambitious. Or proud. Yes, everyone will be impressed with your ability to eat the chilies straight out of the kung pao bowl ... for about five minutes. But you've got to live with that scorched stomach for the rest of your life.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 The city of Tongyeong, located on the southern coast of South Korea , is a popular weekend destination year-round.\n\nIts lures? Fresh seafood, picturesque seascapes and quaint fishing village charm.\n\nPart of the Hallyeohaesang National Park, this hilly city serves as a base for exploring the nearby islands. It's easily reached by express bus -- a four-hour ride from Seoul or an hour from Busan , South Korea's second-largest city.\n\nShowing off the pristine coastal charms of South Korea, it's the perfect place to kick off an island-hopping journey. Here are eight things to see when you travel to Tongyeong:\n\n1. Gangguan Port\n\nMost of Tongyeong's traditional markets, restaurants and shops are located in and around Gangguan Port. Dusk is a great time to take in the lively vibe of this fishing port.\n\nOnce the sun starts to go down, the evening lights illuminate the area and nearby fish markets and restaurants come alive to prepare for the dinner rush.\n\n2. Traditional fish markets\n\nFor the freshest catch of the day head to Jungang Traditional Market, located across the street from Gangguan Port. It's lined with stalls that kick things off in the afternoon and stay busy well into the evening. You can pick out your own fish, which will be cleaned on the spot.\n\nFor a small fee, diners can grab a table nearby and enjoy a traditional Korean raw fish meal. The price includes a spread of condiments, such as dipping sauces, and greens for vegetable wraps.\n\nFor early risers, Seoho Traditional Market is bustling at dawn. This is the place to enjoy shirakguk, a hearty radish leaf soup and rice eaten by local fishermen and fishmongers for breakfast.\n\nYou'll find fresh fish at both markets, although the smaller Seoho Market has a bigger selection of dried seafood.\n\n3. Dongpirang Village\n\nDongpirang: A village saved by art. Shin Kim\n\nWhen this hillside working-class village behind the Jungang Traditional Market was marked for demolition back in 2007, art students were commissioned to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThis village was soon filled with beautiful wall murals -- too beautiful to tear down.\n\nRelated content South Korea's most beautiful places will leave breathless\n\nIt's since become hugely popular and is packed with tourists on weekends. The tight alleyways are filled with colorful, quirky murals, sculptures and art studios. There are cozy cafes at the top of the village offering views of Gangguan Port.\n\nKorean drama fan? The village was used as a set in \"Padam Padam\" and \"The Innocent Man.\"\n\n4. Mireuksan Mountain\n\nFor a stunning 360-degree view of Tongyeong and Hallyeohaesang National Park, which is dotted with islets, take a 10-minute cable car ride up to the top of Mireuksan Mountain . There are different viewing points.\n\nDuring summer, it's a popular destination to take in the area's golden sunsets. After you return to the foot of Mireuksan Mountain, it's worth visiting Donghwasa Temple.\n\nOriginally built in 632, it was reconstructed several times in the 19th century after being destroyed by avalanche and fire.\n\n5. Jeon Hyuck Lim Museum of Art\n\nTongyeong is home to some of South Korea's most famous contemporary artists, including novelist Pak Kyongni, poet Yu Chi-hwan and composer Isang Yun.\n\nFrom the foot of Mireuksan Mountain, a five-minute walk takes you to the private art museum of painter Jeon Hyuck Lim (1916-2010), a celebrated Tongyeong artist referred to as \"magician of colors, painter of the sea.\"\n\nThe museum was built on the grounds of the painter's house, where he lived for 30 years. It's covered in 7,500 ceramic tiles featuring motifs of works by Jeon Hyuck Lim and his son.\n\n6. Island hopping -- on foot?\n\nTo truly appreciate the beauty of Hallyeohaesang National Park's marine ecosystem, visit one of the nearby islands.\n\nSomaemuldo Island, a 1.5-hour ferry ride from Tongyeong Ferry Terminal, is famous for its striking seascape views. There's a coastal hiking path that leads to its tiny neighbor, Deungdaeseom Island (Lighthouse Island).\n\nBut there's a catch. The 150-meter-long trail appears for only for a few hours, twice a day, when the tides ebb. Other nearby islands worth visiting include Bijindo, Jangsado and Hansando.\n\nPro tip: Visit the ferry terminal the day before your trip to check the schedule as it changes daily because of weather conditions.\n\n7. Yi Sun-Sin Park\n\nAdmiral Yi Sun-sin's monument. Shin Kim/CNN\n\nAdmiral Yi Sun-sin (1545-1598), who led battles against the Japanese navy to victory on the Korean peninsula's southern coast, is a highly respected national hero.\n\nTributes to Admiral Yi are found everywhere in Tongyeong and surrounding areas, from shrines to shops named in his honor. There's even a replica of his turtle battle ship in Gangguan Port.\n\nYi Sun-sin Park is worth a visit for anyone who enjoys beautiful coastal views -- there's a nice walking path -- or has an interest in Korean history. Admiral Yi Sun-sin's monument is located a short but steep walk from the parking lot.\n\n8. The flavors of Tongyeong\n\nIn addition to that aforementioned raw fish market meal, there are plenty of restaurants serving local specialties such as sea squirt (meonggae) bibimbap, grilled fish and spicy hairtail stew -- all served with sides of seasonal, local produce and seafood.\n\nIf you're taking an early morning ferry to a nearby island pick up some chungmu kimbap -- mini rice rolls wrapped in seaweed with a side serving of spicy calamari salad and big chunks of radish kimchi.\n\nThis local specialty is found in about a dozen shops by the ferry terminal.\n\nRelated content 7 Korean dishes that are super spicy -- and tips for eating them\n\nLucky enough to be in Tongyeong with a group of people who can hold their drink? Try the \"dajji\" style of dinner. You pay a set price per person for beer and soju, which comes with an array of fresh seafood and side dishes.",

    "text": "Zao Onsen, Japan (CNN) \u2014 As the cable car glides up the mountain in Japan's Yamagata prefecture, the snow-covered fir trees below begin to transform, taking on a bulkier appearance as their green coats disappear under a mass of white.\n\nSoon they become unrecognizable, completely engulfed in fluffy piles of snow.\n\nThe volume in the car increases a few decibels. Passengers excitedly raise their voices, snowboards and skis scraping across the floor as riders shuffle to move into better viewing positions to take in the incredible landscape below.\n\nIt's a common reaction among those first encountering the legendary \"snow monsters\" of Zao Onsen -- or \"juhyo\" in Japanese.\n\nThe excitement intensifies when passengers exit the tram and set out to explore the mysterious figures up close -- some on foot, others clutching their riding gear, ready to glide through the monsters as they make their way down the mountain.\n\nDo you want to build a snowman, Tim?\n\nThe juhyo phenomenon is the result of some pretty harsh weather systems.\n\nAs notoriously heavy winter storms rush though the Zao Mountain Range, blown in by a Siberian jet stream, trees on the upper sections of some peaks begin to collect thick, juicy layers of snow and ice.\n\nThe trees are eventually frozen into the fascinating forms that have turned this small village into a popular winter destination.\n\nMuch like staring into the clouds, part of the fun of exploring Zao's snow monsters includes playing the old \"what do you see\" game -- a snowy version of the Rorschach test.\n\nThe covered trees stand defiantly, bearing poses resembling everything from a cougar frozen mid-roar to a white witch pointing her long bony finger into the blue sky on the horizon.\n\nMany are grotesquely beautiful, deserving of a role in a Tim Burton film.\n\nWe see a wild cat roaring at a zombie as a large woman looks upon the scene disapprovingly. You? Karla Cripps/CNN\n\nRising popularity among foreigners\n\nThough the area is popular with Asia-based tourists, Western ski enthusiasts have traditionally been few in number.\n\nThat's slowly changing says Lyndell Keating, co-director of Powderhounds.com , an online powder skiing guide that also offers ski and snowboarding tours around the world, including in Japan.\n\nRelated content Tohoku: Beautiful scenes of an overlooked region\n\n\"Zao is definitely increasing in its popularity with foreigners,\" says Keating.\n\n\"Seven years ago, we didn't see any other gaijin [foreigners] and no one in the restaurants or our hotel spoke English. Whilst it's not as high-profile as many other Japanese ski resorts for foreigners -- e.g. Niseko, Hakuba, Nozawa Onsen, Myoko Kogen -- there are certainly more visiting now and English is more widely spoken.\"\n\nIndeed, Zao Onsen might not be the first choice for those in search of fresh powder and world-class ski runs.\n\nAt night, the Zao Snow Monsters are illuminated. Zao Ropeway\n\nBut it offers one of the easiest ways to experience the snow monsters, which are found in other parts of Japan though often require substantial efforts to access.\n\n\"If you haven't seen them before they can look pretty impressive and rather dramatic,\" says Keating.\n\n\"What sets Zao apart from other areas is that there are so many snow monsters in peak season, that non-skiers can readily view them, that they host evening illuminated sessions, and that there is a piste run through the middle of them.\"\n\nLay of the snow monster land\n\nTo reach the snow monsters, visitors take two connected, enclosed cable cars, the first of which starts from the main Zao Ski Resort ropeway base.\n\nFor skiers and snowboarders, access to the cable cars is included in the Zao Snow Resort lift package. For those on foot, there's a separate round-trip ticket.\n\nOnce at the top, visitors on foot can head out of the observation area to a roped-off section and roam freely among the snow monsters.\n\nThose planning to ski down the mountain head left to a separate trail that connects with Zao Ski Resort's other runs.\n\nThere are washrooms and a cafeteria-style restaurant in the observation center.\n\nAdvice for skiers/snowboarders\n\nSkiing through snow monsters at Zao Onsen. Courtesy JNTO\n\nZao Ski Resort , which is spread over several peaks, is a mid-sized facility that's ideal for beginner and intermediate riders. Its longest downhill course is a 10-kilometer stretch that starts up at the snow monster observation area.\n\nIt has 42 lifts -- three ropeways, one cable car and 37 chair lifts -- though the layout \"is not particularly ideal and some poling or skating may be required in places,\" says Powderhounds in its review of the resort.\n\nOverall, however, it's an excellent destination for anyone looking for a great day of riding in beautiful scenery.\n\nRelated content Where to find the world's best sake\n\nThe trail leading away from the snow monsters is not for newbies, which means visitors wanting to ski amongst them should evaluate their own abilities first.\n\n\"What's most scary about the snow monsters is that lots of ski tourists like to head down this trail, even if they are only beginners (it's an intermediate rated trail). You have to keep your wits about you,\" says Keating.\n\nAnd of course, bear in mind there's a reason the trees look like this -- the weather can get ugly. So if possible, plan your trip around the forecast.\n\nSome slopes are open for night skiing, excluding the trail leading from the snow monsters. Lessons are available, though those requiring an English instructor are advised to reserve ahead.\n\nRental gear can be found at the ski resort as well as various Zao Onsen shops and some of the bigger hotels.\n\nThis includes snowboards, skis, jackets and pants. Some shops offer helmet and goggle rentals as well, though helmets are not mandatory on the slopes. Gear quality and price varies.\n\nZao Onsen village\n\nZao Onsen itself is a small, walkable mountain village with huge charms, offering a classic small-town Japan experience.\n\nThis being an onsen (hot spring) town, the smell of sulfur is rich in the air -- a scent that can please or repel depending on individual tastes.\n\nIn addition to several public onsens, some hotels have their own in-house hot spring facilities.\n\nAccommodation options range from small inns to a few bigger resorts like Zao Shiki no Hotel , where guests can choose between traditional Japanese or Western-style rooms.\n\nZao Onsen has public hot spring bath houses, though many of the area's hotels offer in-house onsen facilities. Courtesy JNTO\n\nBreakfast and dinner is included as part of the room rate at some accommodations. If you're lucky you'll receive a serving of the phenomenal Yonezawa beef, which is raised in the same prefecture.\n\nIn the village, there are several quality restaurants serving the usual Japanese fare as well as classic izakaya-style bars.\n\nNeed a break from Japanese food? The adorable Craftbeer&Pizza Quantum serves up delicious pizza, has a great selection of beer and plays snowboarding videos.\n\nBut if it's nightlife you're after, you'll be partying on your own. This is not a party town and the streets are fairly dead when the sun goes down.\n\nRegardless, it's worth taking a nighttime stroll.\n\nAfter dark Zao Onsen adopts its own spooky vibe, with steam from the onsen waters rising in big white poofs out of the drains and streams that trickle through the town's hilly slopes. In some areas, colorful lights illuminate the steam.\n\nGetting there and when to go\n\nZao Onsen is worthy of a three-night stay, which will allow you ample time to fit in a bit of riding, hot spring soaking and snow monster exploring. If possible, go during the week -- we had the mountain to ourselves and lift lines were non-existent. Weekends are another story.\n\nThe best time to see the monsters is late January to early March, before the spring warmth seeps in.\n\nFrom January 27 to March 4 the cable cars run from 8:30 a.m. until 9 p.m for those wanting to see the snow monsters illuminated at night.\n\nThe easiest way to get to Zao Onsen is by train and bus. Bullet trains run direct from Tokyo to Yamagata Station throughout the day. The ride takes just over 2.5 hours. Some resorts offer pickups direct from Yamagata Station, which is about 16 kilometers away.\n\nOtherwise, buses depart every hour for Zao Onsen and the journey takes about 40 minutes. At Yamagata Station, follow the signs to the main exit and take a left to the bus station, which is part of the same building.",

    "text": "(CNN) \u2014 It's a chilly Saturday afternoon in February and temperatures are creeping just above the freezing mark -- a time of year when most seaside destinations are devoid of leisure travelers.\n\nBut this is Matsushima, one of the fabled \"Nihon Sankei\" -- or \"Three Views of Japan \" -- and it's buzzing with tourists.\n\nIts fame dates back a few hundred years, to Japan's Edo period, when a Confucius scholar named Hayashi Gah\u014d traveled the country by foot.\n\nRelated content Tohoku: Beautiful scenes of an overlooked region\n\nIn 1643 he published a book based on his journey in which he called out three destinations that, in his eyes, offered incredible scenic beauty -- Amanohashidate, Miyajima and, you guessed it, Matsushima.\n\nIt's easy to see why he deemed this little fishing town in Japan's Miyagi prefecture as worthy of inclusion.\n\nMore than 260 tiny, pine tree-covered islands dot the waters of Matsushima Bay, creating a scene that's been the muse of dozens of Japanese poets and artists through the ages.\n\nMore recently, in 2013 it was inducted into the France-based \" Most Beautiful Bays in the World \" club.\n\nBut the winter visitors we've spotted are not just here for scenic views. They're more interested in the beautiful creatures being cultivated below the surface of the bay's blue waters: Oysters.\n\nMatsushima: One of Japan's three \"most scenic views.\" JTB Photo/UIG via Getty Images\n\nIt all begins with colliding currents\n\nThe window of opportunity to enjoy the region's famed oysters is open from October to March.\n\nAccording to award-winning author Hiroko Shimbo , an expert on Japanese cuisine who organizes culinary tours through the country, Miyagi prefecture is second only to Hiroshima in terms of both sales and volume of cultivated oyster production.\n\nRelated content Where to find the world's best sake\n\nWithout getting too scientific, there are a few reasons Matsushima's oysters in particular are so prized.\n\n\"In the sea off Miyagi prefecture, a warm current travels north from Taiwan along the east coast of Japan,\" Shimbo explains.\n\n\"A cold current that contains nutrient-rich water travels down the coast from north to south. The two currents collide at around the Sanriku area, which includes the coast of Miyagi Prefecture.\"\n\nThe mixing of these currents leads to plankton blooms, which attract migrating fish.\n\n\"This same nutrient- and plankton-rich water makes Matsushima Bay oysters delicious,\" she says, adding that wild oysters were first discovered as a culinary delight and harvested from Matsushima Bay back in the 17th century.\n\n\"After two centuries of intensive harvesting, fishermen found that the wild oysters were almost gone. Then the local government built a laboratory and began the study of cultivating oysters, collecting natural oyster larvae in water and then learning how to farm them under controlled conditions.\n\n\"By 1926 a complete system of oyster aquaculture was developed, and this resulted in the increased quality and production of oysters in the Matsushima Bay area.\"\n\n\n\nMatsushima FIsh Market's oyster shack, pictured on the left, is located in the parking lot. Pongpat Patumsuwon/CNN\n\nAll-you-can-eat oysters\n\nTrue obsessives head straight for the all-you-can-eat oyster shacks.\n\nOn weekends, these small buildings are crammed with mollusk-mad visitors.\n\nDiners pay upfront and are seated at one of the many grilling tables. Armed with a knife, they toss on a glove and dive in, shucking then plucking the sweet, delicate meat from the shell with chopsticks.\n\nSteam fills the space as staff make the rounds, piling the grills high with fresh oysters.\n\nRelated content The ultimate all-you-can-eat noodle binge\n\nPrefer to eat your oysters raw? Head for one of the many restaurants in the town, which serve a variety of oyster-based dishes.\n\n\"Raw oysters are eaten just as is or served with ponzu sauce (soy sauce, mirin, yuzu citrus fruit juice) or with lemon juice and grated daikon spiced with red chili pepper,\" says Shimbo.\n\n\"We also deep-fry them after dredging in panko bread crumbs. This dish, called 'kaki furai', is a popular lunch dish at inexpensive restaurants everywhere in the country. We also make a miso-flavored hot pot with oysters, called 'kaki no dotenabe.'\"\n\nOne Matsushima cruise company even runs special oyster hot pot cruises around the bay, allowing culinary tourists a chance to eat the delicious delicacies while taking in the area's famous views.\n\nAnything else to eat?\n\nOther local specialties include salmon, tuna, pike and clams. JNTO\n\nCan't visit during oyster season? Matsushima's got plenty of other seafood that will not disappoint.\n\n\"Seafood in the Matsushima area is considered of the highest quality because the seafood harvested in the area benefits from the nutrient-rich water and plankton found off its coast,\" says Shimbo.\n\n\"In addition to oysters there are such local specialties as salmon, skipjack tuna (katsuo), Pacific pike (sanma), northern clam (hokkigai), asari clams, abalone (awabi), scallops (hotategai) and the best-quality wakame sea vegetable -- don't call it seaweed!\"\n\nThe small but substantial Matsushima Fish Market is a fine place to kick off a culinary tour of the town.\n\nYou can order from a variety of vendors serving everything from ramen to sushi and oyster burgers.\n\nRelated content Welcome to Sendai, beef tongue capital of the world\n\nElsewhere, you'll have no trouble finding a busy seafood restaurant serving local specialties. After dark, however, once all the day trippers have departed, things get really quiet.\n\nThere are a few restaurants open in the evening but we recommend heading for Isozushi (4-12 Isozaki, Matsushima, +81 22-353-2826), a gorgeous little sushi joint tucked down a small road about one kilometer from the fish market.\n\nRun by a charming couple in their sixties, the restaurant's menu is no frills, meaning the seafood is the star.\n\nThe pair can't speak much English and there are no photos on the Japanese menu but if you just say \"omakase\" -- which basically means \"you can decide\" -- the chef will prepare a fantastic selection of local highlights for a decent price.\n\nWhat else is there to do?\n\nWhen you're not busy eating, you're going to want to spend some time exploring this walkable town and its famed bay.\n\nMany travelers visit Matsushima just for the day from nearby Sendai -- the capital of Miyagi prefecture -- but it's worth an overnight visit. There are a variety of inns and bigger, higher-end hotels. These include Matsushima Ichinobo , a large four-star property with lovely outdoor onsens (hot spring spas) overlooking the bay.\n\nTo truly appreciate Matsushima's beauty, head straight for the shore near the Matsushima Kaigan train station.\n\nSeveral islands are connected to the mainland by photo-worthy red bridges, such as the exquisite Fukuurabashi Bridge, which leads to Fukuurajima Island\n\nHome to more than 300 species of flowers, plants and trees, the island's network of walking paths leads to several viewpoints. Tickets can be purchased at Cafe Bayland, which is connected to the bridge's entrance.\n\nNearby, the beautiful Godaido Temple, founded in 807, sits on another small island that's also connected to the mainland via a series of red bridges.\n\nTo explore further afield, cruises depart from Matsushima Pier every hour. The 50-minute tour takes travelers around the bay, passing islands and oyster farms. A prerecorded narration offers info on the area in both English and Japanese.\n\nTickets can be purchased in the bay, near the Fukuurabashi Bridge.\n\nOther local attractions worth visiting include Saigyo Modoshi no Matsu Park (it offers great views of the bay) and a handful of picturesque temple complexes such as Entsuin and Zuiganji.\n\nGetting there\n\nMatsushima is located just under three hours by train from Tokyo Station. Travelers will need to transfer to the JR Senseki Line from Sendai Station and get off at Matsushima Kaigan Station, which is actually closer to the main sights than the main Matsushima Station.",

In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 80 confirmed cases of the illness, and 219 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them.",

    "text": "(CNN) For 10 years, some residents in Denmark, South Carolina, have been suspicious of the rust-colored water coming from their taps. They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.\n\nBut through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.\n\nThe state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do.\"\n\nPhotos: Residents don't trust their tap water CNN's Sara Ganim, left, with Denmark residents Eugene Smith and Paula Brown.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled. But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment.",

    "text": "(CNN) An Oklahoma jury has awarded $25.5 million to the family of a cancer patient denied coverage by Aetna, with jurors saying that the insurer acted \"recklessly\" and that the verdict was meant as a message for Aetna to change its ways.\n\nThe award is believed to be the largest verdict in an individual \"bad faith\" insurance case in Oklahoma history, one court observer said, and could have major ramifications across the country for a form of cancer treatment called proton beam therapy.\n\nThe case revolved around the 2014 denial of coverage for Orrana Cunningham, who had stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer near her brain stem. Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians. Many radiation oncologists express frustrations about the denials, and websites exist offering tips and recommendations on how to try to get insurance companies to pay for coverage of proton therapy.\n\nOther cancer patients often turn to sites like GoFundMe to raise money for their treatment. Some insurers eventually agree to cover therapy for adult patients after a lengthy appeals process.\n\nRon Cunningham said that his wife was his \"rock\" and that the verdict was justice.\n\nDaniel E. Smith, executive director of the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access , applauded the verdict and called on insurance commissioners in all 50 states to make sure the treatment will now be covered by insurance companies when treating doctors believe that it is the best available treatment for their patients.\n\n\"We applaud Ron Cunningham for standing up to Aetna, and the jury for recognizing and holding Aetna to account for their broken system,\" Smith said in a statement. \"We've seen a similar pattern of betrayal across the industry, where insurers use outdated information and medical staff with little knowledge of proton therapy to ultimately deny as many as four in 10 patients seeking the treatment. It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire. He'd come home, place his head in her lap and tell her everything on his mind.\n\n\"She was a rock for me, especially through my bad times,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe past two weeks at trial, he said, were especially hard because it brought back so many memories. Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said.",

    "text": "(CNN) The world's total fertility rate has been cut in half since 1950, but the population is still rising, according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet.\n\nThe total fertility rate -- or the average number of children a woman would have if she lived through all her reproductive years -- declined from 4.7 live births in 1950 to 2.4 in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the global population has nearly tripled since 1950, from 2.6 billion people to 7.6 billion, the report says. An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked.",

    "text": "(CNN) It sounds simple enough: juice a bunch of celery, drink it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, and wait for the health benefits to roll in.\n\nA search for #CeleryJuice on Instagram returns over 35,000 posts, not including all the variations on the hashtag. Some social media users say that drinking celery juice has cured them of mental health problems and infertility . Others credit it with healing eczema that nothing else could cure. One website even claims that it can prevent cancer. Stories touting its \"potent healing properties\" have appeared on Gwyneth Paltrow's controversial lifestyle site, Goop\n\nBut are these health benefits real?\n\n\"It's not a surprise to me that anything a celebrity or an influencer with lots of followers would mention would get a lot of attention,\" Lisa Drayer, a registered dietitian who writes about nutrition for CNN, said of the celery juice trend.\n\nCelery certainly has health benefits, according to Drayer. \"There are some beneficial flavonoids that have been discovered in celery that have been shown to perhaps play a role in reducing inflammation in the brain or reducing age-related memory decline,\" she said.\n\nCelery also provides a healthy dose of fiber, as well as vitamins C and K and potassium, and it is a very low-calorie snack.\n\n\"A 5-inch stalk has only three calories, so that's very low-calorie. A cup of chopped celery has only 20 calories,\" she said. But turning it into juice can change this.\n\n\"Any time you concentrate a vegetable or a fruit, it's going to be higher in sugars and carbohydrates and calories,\" Drayer said. A cup of juiced celery jumps to 42 calories.\n\n\"I'm much more likely to recommend celery as a snack. It's crunchy, it's low-calorie, and it will fill you up,\" Drayer said. In fact, she often advises it this for people who are trying to lose weight.\n\nResearch around the benefits of celery and celery juice is limited, she noted, and we \"really can't say there's anything magical about celery that's going to help cure cancer or help you to quickly shed pounds.\"\n\nJuicing celery has other drawbacks beyond raising the calorie count.\n\n\"Juicing celery (and any other vegetable) strips away the beneficial fiber that helps you feel fuller longer, improves intestinal health and feeds the health bacteria in your gut,\" Malina Malkani , registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , wrote in an email.\n\nCelery juice does lend itself to \"gorgeous\" social media images.\n\nAlthough she agrees that there are several health benefits to eating celery, she also agrees that there is little evidence to back up the claims made by some supporters of the juice trend.\n\n\"There isn't much scientific evidence to support the majority of health claims about drinking celery juice,\" she said. \"In general, if a food fad, diet or service sounds too good to be true, you can assume that it is.\"\n\nThere's something else about celery juice that could explain its popularity on social media: \"The beautiful green color of celery juice also lends itself to gorgeous photos in an Instagram feed,\" said Malkani, who is also creator of the Wholitarian Lifestyle, which promotes foods that \"are nutrient-dense, minimally processed, plant-based and as close as possible to their original state when first harvested.\" However, she pointed out that this doesn't mean there is evidence behind the health claims.\n\nNeither Drayer nor Malkani thinks that drinking celery juice is problematic, but they stress that it is probably not a miracle cure.\n\n\"If you enjoy the flavor of celery juice, have at it!\" Malkani said. \"But don't jump on the Instagram bandwagon, hoping that celery juice will be the cure-all you've been searching for all your life.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBoth suggest that celery should be eaten as part of a balanced and inclusive diet and that everyone should be wary of celebrity-endorsed food trends.\n\n\"In general, just because a celebrity is touting a food or a beverage for particular reasons doesn't mean it's backed by sound science, even beyond celery juice,\" Drayer said. \"What I always tell people is that there's no one magical food or beverage that will be able to totally make over your health or cure an illness.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) An important transition is happening across the United States: Cancer was the leading cause of death in more counties in 2015 than 13 years earlier, a new study finds. However, the opposite was true for heart disease during that period; fewer counties reported it as the top killer.\n\nIn fact, cancer will replace heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States within two years, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projections referenced in the study, published Monday in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\"We're just on the cusp of the transition from heart disease to cancer as the leading cause of death,\" said Dr. Latha Palaniappan, lead author of the study and an internist, professor and clinical researcher at Stanford University Medical Center.\n\nShifts in socioeconomic, ethnic groups\n\nA decades-old theory described a shift that occurred in health and disease patterns in the United States during the last century. Early in the 100-year period, infectious diseases including tuberculosis, diphtheria and flu took more American lives than other illnesses. Yet by the end of the century, chronic diseases, including heart disease and cancer, had become the leading cause of death. The theory described these complex patterns and suggested that such shifts stemmed from economic and social conditions.\n\nRecent data suggests that the nation is experiencing a new transition, this time within the chronic disease category itself. To understand these changes, Stanford Medical School researchers examined more than 32 million death records across 3,143 American counties for 2003 through 2015. The research team looked not only at medical information but at demographic data, including income and race.\n\nOver the 13-year study period, the mortality rate decreased in the total population by 12%, from about 823 deaths per every 100,000 people to roughly 724 deaths per 100,000.\n\nIn more than three-quarters of all counties (79%), heart disease was the leading cause of death in 2003, yet this remained true for only 59% of counties in 2015.\n\nBy contrast, cancer caused the most deaths in about two of every 10 counties during 2003, with the same true for four of every 10 counties in 2015.\n\nWhile the overall heart disease mortality rate decreased by 28%, high-income counties experienced a 30% drop, versus a 22% fall in low-income counties. The cancer mortality rate also dropped, though less dramatically: It declined by 16%, with an 18% drop seen in high-income counties versus 11% in low-income.\n\nAccording to the researchers, lower-income areas may see a slower shift in the cause of death due to socioeconomic, geographic, demographic and other factors that influence health and death.\n\nThe researchers also compared shifts in patterns for racial and ethnic groups. Here, they found that among Asian-Americans, Hispanics and whites, cancer replaced heart disease as the leading cause of death. However, a similar pattern was not seen among American Indians/Alaska Natives or blacks.\n\nEconomic factors also affect the new pattern of mortality rates across the nation. Heart disease surpassed other causes of death in the lowest-income counties for all racial and ethnic groups during 2015, the researchers found, yet only Asian-Americans, Hispanics and whites in the highest-income counties saw cancer outpace heart disease as the leading cause of death in 2015.\n\nMaking improvements in cancer care available to all\n\nThe research \"provides another lens\" for interpreting dynamics related to the transition in mortality patterns, wrote Silvia Stringhini, a researcher at Switzerland's Lausanne University Hospital, and Dr. Idris Guessous, a practicing physician and epidemiologist at Switzerland's Geneva University Hospitals, in an editorial published with the study.\n\n\"The driving force behind the transition from the age of 'pestilence and famine' to the age of 'manmade diseases' is improvement in socioeconomic conditions, such as standards of living, health habits, hygiene, and nutrition,\" Stringhini and Guessous wrote.\n\nHow genetic testing, screening and personalized medicine affect cancer rates is still unclear, they noted. New and expensive cancer therapies are being introduced, yet they might contribute to \"increasing social inequalities in cancer survival, with better-off persons experiencing more rapid decreases in mortality,\" they added. And the same may be true of genetic testing and cancer screening, they noted.\n\nIt's likely that any differences in mortality trends could be explained by differences in smoking, obesity and diabetes trends among high and low income groups, the authors stated. \"For example, between 1960 and 2015, the prevalence of smoking in the United States decreased from 39% to 6% among college graduates but from 46% to 23% among persons who did not complete high school,\" they wrote.\n\nWith cancer about to overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death, what do most Americans need to know?\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Undergo all of the recommended cancer screenings,\" Palaniappan advised, and adopt \"lifestyle prevention practices, such as healthy diet and exercise, which are beneficial in lowering both cancer and heart disease mortality.\"\n\n\"The investments in research in both heart disease and cancer have paid off over the last decades because both heart disease and cancer rates are going down,\" she said. \"Without all of the wonderful new therapies that we have now, this would not have happened.\"\n\nStill, there's more work to be done, she said: \"We need to work harder in lower income areas of the US so they can see the same improvements in mortality. We need to focus more on heart disease and cancer prevention and treatment efforts in African-American populations particularly.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) New cholesterol guidelines recommend a more personalized approach in risk assessments, a returned focus on LDL target levels and new drug options for those at highest risk for cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were announced Saturday during the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference.\n\n\"High cholesterol treatment is not one size fits all, and this guideline strongly establishes the importance of personalized care,\" Dr. Michael Valentine, president of the American College of Cardiology, said in a press release\n\n\"Over the past five years, we've learned even more about new treatment options and which patients may benefit from them,\" he said. \"By providing a treatment roadmap for clinicians, we are giving them the tools to help their patients understand and manage their risk and live longer, healthier lives.\"\n\nCriticism of previous guidelines\n\nThe new recommendations address many of the concerns raised when the guidelines were last updated five years ago.\n\nThose 2013 guidelines were troublesome for a number of reasons, explained Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic: The previous guidelines used a risk calculator that left out crucial components such as family history; they didn't address the issue of people older than 75 or younger than 40; they overhyped the risks many patients faced while lowering the threshold needed to warrant statin drug therapy; and they did away with the use of LDL (bad) cholesterol target levels, which helped patients set meaningful goals.\n\nPeople with LDL levels of 100 or lower, \"tend to have lower rates of heart disease and stroke, supporting a 'lower is better' philosophy,\" according to a statement from the medical organizations about the new guidelines.\n\nA level of above 160 is considered \"very high,\" according to a release from Johns Hopkins Medicine , which also outlined the new guidelines. For high risk patients, the recommendation is to lower \"bad\" cholesterol to levels below 70.\n\nIf statin therapy fails to lower LDL levels adequately, in patients who've already had a heart attack or stroke, the new guidelines suggest adding other drugs -- ezetimibe, which is available as a generic -- to the regimen. If that combination doesn't work sufficiently for patients who are at a very high risk, a PCSK9 inhibitor can be added.\n\nThe new approach encourages increased collaboration between doctors and their patients. Doctors are encouraged to discuss a broad range of factors that may increase risks, such as family history and ethnicity, as well as other conditions including metabolic syndrome, premature menopause and chronic kidney disease.\n\nImpact of high cholesterol on all age groups\n\nDoctors are also being urged to look at the lifetime of patients and how high cholesterol takes a toll. Children born to especially high-risk families can be tested when they are as young as 2. For most children, though, the recommendation is to have an initial test between ages 9 and 11, and then a follow-up test between the ages of 17 and 21.\n\nAnd just as cholesterol levels in younger people shouldn't be ignored, the same goes for those over 75, the new recommendations say.\n\n\"They now acknowledge that it might be appropriate to treat older people,\" something they didn't do in 2013, said Nissen, who was highly critical of the last round of guidelines. \"Today's 75-year-old can live a long time.\"\n\nAll of these developments are good signs, \"a step forward,\" Nissen said. \"It took five years to fix the problems with the last set of guidelines, but I'm glad they've been addressed.\"\n\nNissen offered just one criticism of the new recommendations: the suggestion that coronary artery calcium scores be used to help determine the need for cholesterol-lowering treatments in patients for whom the need isn't clear. This score shows plaque buildup in arteries and is determined through a CT scan, which can cost between $800 and $1,000, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"You're radiating somebody in order to decide whether to use a drug that costs as little as $3 a month, and you're spending a lot of money to do it,\" he said. \"I just don't think it's prudent.\"\n\nBut other than that issue, Nissen is pleased. \"The big picture is this is a reasonable set of guidelines,\" he said.\n\n\"Having high cholesterol at any age increases that risk significantly,\" Dr. Ivor Benjamin, president of the American Heart Association, said in a written statement. \"That's why it's so important that even at a young age, people follow a heart-healthy lifestyle and understand and maintain healthy cholesterol levels.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) I often tell people to steer clear of alcoholic beverages when trying to lose weight. After all, they don't exactly provide nutritious calories, and consuming them can make it increasingly more challenging to lose weight. But that doesn't stop people from asking me, \"what is the best drink to have on a diet?\"\n\nClearly, some alcoholic beverages are more waistline-friendly than others. So the short answer is: If you're looking to shed pounds, some of your lowest-calorie bets are a shot of spirits (for example, a 1.5-ounce shot of vodka, gin, rum, whiskey or tequila contains an average of 97 calories), a glass of champagne (about 84 calories per 4 ounces); a glass of dry wine (approximately 120 to 125 calories per 5 ounces) or a traditional martini, with an average of 124 calories for a 2.5-ounce serving. A light beer (approximately 100 calories) or a glass of reduced-calorie wine (about 90 to 100 calories) are other lower-calorie options.\n\nBut if you want to know why some alcoholic beverages contain more calories than others, read on.\n\nPure alcohol contains 7 calories per gram -- that's less than a gram of fat, which has 9 calories, but more than protein and carbs, which have 4 calories per gram each -- but other variables of your drink influence the calorie count. The amount of alcohol, the total volume of a beverage, the amount of carbohydrates and sugars and mixers all play a role.\n\nGenerally speaking, the biggest difference in calories in beverages comes from the alcohol content, but the presence of carbohydrates in alcoholic beverages also contributes largely to its calories, according to Dwayne Bershaw, who teaches winemaking classes in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) Most of you have probably never heard of fascia, or if you have, it may be in the context of \"blasting\" it to treat cellulite. But talking about fascia has become trendy recently, and not only in the context of looking better in your swimsuit.\n\nA Google search returns more than 79 million hits for the term, and there is even a conference, now in its fifth year, that is entirely devoted to fascia research.\n\nWhat is fascia?\n\nAccording to Stedman's Medical Dictionary, fascia is \"a sheet of fibrous tissue that envelops the body beneath the skin; it also encloses muscles and groups of muscles and separates their several layers or groups.\"\n\nBut this definition is incomplete. Fascia can actually be classified into four types, each with different properties, functions and characteristics. The superficial fascia surrounds the body and includes subcutaneous fat; the deep fascia surrounds the musculoskeletal system; the meningeal fascia surrounds the nervous system; the visceral fascia surrounds body cavities and organs.\n\nIn mainstream medicine, fascia is rarely considered in isolation as the cause of chronic pain disorders. One exception is plantar fasciitis, a painful and relatively common condition in which the fascia that is responsible for maintaining the arch in your foot is inflamed. The inflammation is directly attributed to a stiffening and a decrease in the flexibility of the fascia, according to orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine physician Dr. Shabi Khan.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic references fascia when describing myofascial pain syndrome (\"myo\" is short for muscle), but according to Khan, there is \"little sophisticated knowledge in terms of the functionality or treatment of problems with the fascia,\" and \"when compared with the muscle and tendon structure, fascia has a much less dynamic role.\" He does note that fascia, like most connective tissue in the body, stiffens with age, overuse and injury. The direct role of fascial changes in causing pain and structural changes in conditions such as chronic lower back pain, headaches and cellulite is less clear.\n\nSome body work practitioners including massage therapists, osteopaths, Rolfers, craniosacral therapists and physical therapists claim that fascial restrictions (essentially tightening) -- caused by injury, inflammation, trauma, disuse, overuse, misuse or abuse -- play an important role in contributing to the pain associated with a wide array of conditions including migraines, fibromyalgia, headaches, lower back pain and women's health issues.\n\nFascia specialists claim that treating these fascial restrictions with a variety of methods, including proprietary bodywork methods and/or specialized tools, is an important aspect of overcoming these chronic and painful conditions.\n\nBut what does the science say? Is fascia really that important, and if it is, is there anything we can do to \"fix\" the fascia and get rid of the pain?\n\nIs fascia real science?\n\nDespite the growing interest, the science of fascia, its clinical relevance and how best to treat it (assuming it is clinically relevant) remains controversial, and there is very limited high-quality research to evaluate and support it.\n\nAfter interviewing nearly a dozen experts including medical doctors specializing in anatomy, pathology and orthopedic surgery, and bodywork experts including massage therapists and a physical therapist, I have come to the conclusion that there are two major challenges to fascia research and scientific validation.\n\nFirst, there are major issues with the definition of fascia. Many in traditional medicine consider fascia as simply the tough, fibrous connective tissue surrounding muscle tissue and separating soft tissue areas (including fat) throughout the body. But those who focus on treating it have a broader definition that includes a more dynamic component of fascia (not just the less flexible fibrous tissue), called the extracellular matrix, which is made up of fluid, proteins and carbohydrates.\n\nLending support to this broader definition, pathologist Dr. Neil Theise published a study this year in which he described newly discovered features of the interstitium: fluid-filled spaces within and between all tissues in your body. Thiese believes that interstitium is a component of fascia, and since it is fluid, it can be manipulated.\n\n\"Traditional medicine was wrong to dismiss that idea\" that fascia is more than merely connective tissue, Theise said. \"Nomenclature is an issue: If you focus on the connective tissue, you call it 'fascia'; if you focus on the fluid, it's 'interstitium.' We have a lot of talking and work to do across disciplines to sort this out.\"\n\nThough many fascia manipulation advocates claim that lengthening the restricted fascia is the key to successful treatment, Tom Myers, a prolific author, practitioner and educator of fascial and myofascial anatomy and treatment for more than 40 years, has changed his position over the past decade and now admits that the fibrous component of fascia is actually very difficult to lengthen through manual therapy. He still believes in the clinical relevance and treatment of fascia, but he admits that skin, nerves and muscle are also involved.\n\nAre fascia treatments proven?\n\nMyers' approach to treating fascial restrictions evolved from the work of Ida Rolf, a pioneering female scientist in the 1920s who developed a method of treating fascia called Structural Integration (commonly referred to today as Rolfing.) According to the official Rolfing website, the method works \"to release, realign and balance the whole body, thus potentially resolving discomfort, reducing compensations and alleviating pain.\" Myers claims that this type of treatment, performed over a number of sessions, improves the movement between layers of fascia surrounding structures including tendons, nerves, muscle and ligaments.\n\nPhysical therapist Valerie McGraw, who has worked closely for 28 years with John Barnes, the creator of the Myofascial Release Approach (MFR), supports the concept of modifying the fluid component of fascia. According to the official MFR website , \"Myofascial Release is a safe and very effective hands-on technique that involves applying gentle sustained pressure into the Myofascial connective tissue restrictions to eliminate pain and restore motion.\"\n\nMcGraw describes improvements in the fascial fluid as one of the benefits of their manual technique that differs from others, she says, in that it reaches deeper into the tissue and manually engages it for three to five minutes or more before moving on, rather than sliding on the surface like other forms of bodywork. In a way, it is similar to yoga in that the pressure in a specific region is held for longer, just like yoga poses can be held for longer periods instead of the rapid movement of weight lifting or running.\n\nMcGraw also explained that myofascial release practitioners incorporate numerous treatment methods including elongation stretching, a form of cupping (using a sustained pull for three to five minutes or more), and self-treatment utilizing simple pressure tools such as a small air-filled ball and a foam roller into their treatment plans.\n\nThough manual therapies like Myofascial Release and Rolfing are probably not modifying the length of the fibrous component of the fascia, they might be affecting the flexibility of fascia, which could provide the purported beneficial effects. In fact, a very small 2017 study in healthy men using dynamic ultrasound imaging found that myofascial release decreased the stiffness of the fascia in the lower back, and another study found 20% greater stiffness of the lower back fascia in subjects with chronic lower back pain. Another study evaluated two sessions of fascial manipulation added to standard care after hip surgery and found a modest improvement in the flexibility in the hip joint. There are other case reports of the benefits of various fascial treatment methods , but overall evidence of the effectiveness of treatment is limited.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnother major issue with putting so much emphasis on fascia and how to treat it effectively is that it is highly unlikely that fascia ever works or can be treated in isolation from other tissues. Muscles, tendons, ligaments and nerves play an essential and more clearly established role in many chronic pain conditions. The complex interaction and interconnection of all the tissues involved presents a significant challenge to defining and isolating the relevance of fascia.\n\nWhat's the bottom line? If a bodywork practitioner or specialized tool claims to be treating your fascia to relieve your chronic pain (or help you get rid of cellulite), you may indeed get the hoped-for results, but it's a lot more complicated than just fixing the fascia.",

    "text": "(CNN) This might sound strange, but I found talking to my dog much less stressful than talking to my babies. They had a lot in common: Both were non-verbal, both relied on me for their well-being, and both were in possession of what Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz called \" baby schema .\"\n\nThis is the combination of large head, round face and big eyes that we humans find irresistibly cute and motivates us to care for vulnerable and needy creatures.\n\nThe difference between dog and baby, though, is potential consequences. Nobody tells you how important it is to talk to your dog. Everybody tells you how crucial it is to talk to your baby.\n\nAccording to the mountain of research on the importance of talking to babies and toddlers , the first three years of a child's life are a period of rapid and expansive brain development. Talking to young children helps fire up the connections that will allow them to process language. The more words they hear, the stronger those connections get.\n\nWhen there's a lot at stake, performance anxiety tends to kick in. Do I have to be in constant narration mode when chatting with my 18-month-old, like a Werner Herzog of my own life? \"Now, Mommy wets her toothbrush. Now, Mommy puts the toothbrush in her mouth ...\" Or is it OK to let it all unfold a bit more organically, including regular breaks for -- dare I say it? -- silence?\n\nMake it a conversation\n\n\"Back and forth responsiveness\" is the most important thing when talking to a baby or toddler, according to Alice Honig, professor emerita in the department of human development and family science at Syracuse University and co-author of \" Talking With Your Baby .\" \"It's about real intimate connection.\"\n\nFor young babies, this means making a small \"coo\" sound and waiting, patiently, for the baby to make a \"coo\" in response. She said parents and caregivers should try this out early on, even if the baby doesn't \"coo\" back right away.\n\n\"It sends them the message that 'I'm important. Somebody is talking to me. I have to focus.' Before one month, they can focus when we talk to them.\"\n\nHonig said that as babies mature, it is appropriate to move from \"coos\" to words to sentences. However, do not stop speaking in the kind of baby talk experts call \"parentese.\" This is that high-octave, musical, long-voweled \" schmoopy \" tone that we associate with affection.\n\nAnother important thing to remember is that even if children can't speak yet, they can still communicate.\n\nHonig noted the distinction between expressive language and receptive language. The former is being able to talk back. The latter is being able to understand what was said.\n\nMy 18-month-old's expressive language skills are at an age-appropriate minimum. But his receptive language skills are not bad! The other day, my husband and I were talking about how it was time to feed the dog, and our toddler, without instruction, went and grabbed the dog bowl and walked it over to where the food is.\n\n\"Receptive language is the one you want to be alert to,\" Honig said, explaining that it is how we know the child really understands what is happening around her and what is being said to her.\n\nHonig encourages parents and caregivers to work on cultivating these receptive skills, largely by asking questions. She said toddlers can benefit from being asked questions with one-word answers. Apple or pear? Truck or ball? Happy or sad? (Emotion questions are doubly effective, because they teach them how to label, and ultimately understand, their feelings.)\n\nParents should also be asking open-ended questions that push young children to think critically and creatively, which communicates that their opinion matters. Ask toddlers whether they can figure out how to get around a puddle in a park or what they can do with a pile of blocks or with a handful of clay. Many will respond through their bodies, even if they don't have the words.\n\nAs to the right timing for all these stages, Honig says, it depends. \"Let your child teach you where your child is at,\" she said.\n\nQuality can matter more than quantity\n\nIn 2003, education researchers Betty Hart and Todd R. Risley coined the term \" word gap \" based on their findings that low-income children hear, on average, 30 million fewer words by the age of 3 than their wealthier counterparts. As a result, their language skills tended to be less-developed, and they were less likely to succeed in school.\n\nTheir findings have been both critiqued and confirmed over the years, and many nonprofits and government initiatives were set up to increase the number of words children heard in their early years.\n\nThough both this study and many of the interventions inspired by it are important, the conversation around the word gap is often misleading. The takeaway is that, when it comes to talking to young children, it's the volume that matters.\n\n\"My sense is that we are coming to a consensus in the field, and a number of studies have found, that the types of conversations we have with children matter more than the number of words,\" said Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, professor of psychology at Temple University and author of a number of books on early childhood development.\n\nLike Honig, she said that the key is to make talking to your young children feel like a conversation as much as possible. \"I responded to you, and you responded to me, and we both listened to what the other was saying. It is really important to human species; think about it is as human glue. ... This matters for building brain area, whereas the number of words don't.\"\n\nHirsh-Pasek said parents shouldn't feel as though they have to narrate their lives for their children. It's perfectly acceptable to, say, push a small child in a cart down an aisle in a supermarket and not speak out loud the name of a single item on the shelf.\n\nHowever, as that worry recedes another one should replace it: screens. \"There is a lot of talk about kids' media use, but the real issue, with respect to language and conversations, is not kids' media use [but rather] adult media use. The more we are constantly looking down at our cell phone, the more we turn off, the more they get detached from conversation,\" she said.\n\nHirsh-Pasek encourages parents to put their devices away as much as possible during the evening or on weekends . Not only will they be better suited to participate in conversations, they'll be more likely to start one themselves.\n\nEnjoy it\n\nAs crazy as it is to compare talking to a young child to talking to a dog, I think my early puppy days might have actually taught me a thing or two on how to communicate with bipeds. After looking at the research and speaking with experts, I see that the best way to tell if you are communicating productively with a baby is to ask yourself: Am I enjoying this?\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nChances are, if you are feeling a connection, immersed in one moment shared by two, then your baby is probably feeling the same. That uninhibited ease with which I approached talking to my dog is, it turns out, not a bad place to start with our children, as well. Seek joy, indulge curiosities, and chances are that all the pieces will fall into place.",

    "text": "(CNN) The woman had used oxycodone for almost a decade but told her doctors she had been sober for two years. She never touched narcotics during her pregnancy, she said, and had completed rehab.\n\nBut her newborn son was in withdrawal: jittery, screaming and requiring an infusion of morphine to stay alive. The infant craved drugs, but why?\n\nAmid an opioid epidemic , the boy's doctors didn't blame heroin, fentanyl or other illicit substances. Instead, they said, the infant had grown dependent on a controversial herbal supplement: kratom.\n\n'A false sense of safety'\n\nAccording to a case report published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics, both the unnamed woman and her infant passed urine drug screens that looked specifically for oxycodone and other opioids. But those tests didn't look for kratom, a legal drug that has opioid-like effects at high doses.\n\nThe plant, which is native to Southeast Asia, is typically used to treat pain and curb opioid cravings. Acting on the same brain receptors as morphine and similar drugs, it is hailed by some as a solution to the opioid epidemic but derided by the US Food and Drug Administration as a potentially dangerous psychoactive drug.\n\nThe mother denied using any substances during her pregnancy -- legal or otherwise -- but her husband told doctors that she drank kratom tea daily to treat her withdrawal symptoms and help with sleep.\n\n\"I fear that women making genuine commitments to overcome their dependency may develop a false sense of safety by using a substance that is advertised as a non-opioid alternative,\" said Dr. Whitney Eldridge, a neonatologist for BayCare Health System in Florida who was lead author on the case report.\n\nThe mother might have been well-intentioned, but because tests showed no other drugs in her or the infant, her doctors said kratom probably caused her son's condition, known clinically as neonatal abstinence syndrome. On his eighth day of life, after he had been weaned off opioids and observed without any medications, the boy was discharged to his parents.\n\nIt's rare, but FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that \"this case is not unique.\" He said the FDA \"is aware of four other cases involving neonates exposed to kratom while in utero who experienced neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome after term delivery.\"\n\nof Gottlieb, whose agency has issued a variety warnings on kratom, called the new report \"a tragic case of harm\" and said it \"further illustrates the concerns the FDA has identified about kratom, including the potential for abuse and addiction.\"\n\nAnd though Eldridge hopes more research will help lawmakers better regulate kratom, she believes that physicians today \"need to counsel women who are pregnant about the risk of kratom such as they would any other legal substance that can have ill effects on their newborn.\"\n\nExperts urge caution, cast doubt\n\nSome experts are hesitant to draw any conclusions from the report. They note that although maternal kratom use could theoretically cause neonatal abstinence syndrome, the case did not explicitly link kratom to the infant's withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that this is possible,\" said Dr. Andrew Kruegel, an associate research scientist at Columbia University, \"because kratom certainly has opioid effects and can induce tolerance in users, especially at higher doses.\"\n\nBut Kruegel, who has studied the plant for seven years, noted that doctors weren't able to test the purported kratom itself. \"The main limitation is that we don't know anything about the dosage that the mother was taking,\" he said. \"Without that information, you can't really extrapolate too much.\"\n\nAnd the mother might not have been taking kratom at all, said Dr. Edward W. Boyer, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"It's the husband who reported the kratom use,\" he said. \"The wife who actually ingested the product, who thought it was kratom, and the authors of the case report itself, none of those people actually verified that she was ingesting kratom.\"\n\nKratom's rocky past and uncertain future\n\nDespite the FDA's warnings, kratom is easy to buy and is sometimes sold as a tea in caf\u00e9s . The nonprofit American Kratom Association estimates that 3 million to 5 million Americans use the substance, and the group says it's open to warning labels on kratom products.\n\n\"We believe that, as in many supplements, there should be a warning that pregnant women shouldn't take this,\" Dave Herman, the association's chairman, said. \"That's not because we think it's detrimental. It's because it's a safety measure.\"\n\nKratom acts on opioid receptors, which the FDA says is evidence of its potential for abuse. The agency points to 44 deaths associated with kratom, but Kruegel said that \"if you look at those 44 deaths, the vast majority of them involve other substances, including other strong opioids.\"\n\nBoyer said kratom may have other risks, such as seizures, but he noted that it might be safer than most opioids because \"there does not seem to be respiratory depression when kratom is used alone.\"\n\nRespiratory depression -- slow and ineffective breathing -- is what makes opioid overdoses so deadly. That's why Boyer believes well-regulated kratom could one day be used in the fight against opioid addiction, steering users away from more dangerous drugs.\n\n\"If you do the right thing and do the rigorous studies, then there is no reason why [kratom] shouldn't be a prescription pharmaceutical that serves as a bridge to formal drug treatment, particularly for individuals who can't get into therapy,\" Boyer said.\n\nChallenges to developing kratom-based drugs\n\nThe American Kratom Association says there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to study kratom as a potential prescription drug, especially because they can't patent the raw plant.\n\n\"If I'm a drug company, I think that it costs somewhere, depending on who you speak to, between $1.2 and $1.8 billion to bring a new drug to market,\" Herman said. \"Who would spend that kind of money when some other guy can just get on a boat, ride down a river and grab it off a tree?\"\n\nBecause kratom is considered a dietary supplement , manufacturers don't need FDA approval to sell it as long as their products don't claim to cure or treat specific conditions or symptoms.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut some companies have done just that, drawing the FDA's ire for saying their products could \"relieve opioid withdrawal\" or \"treat a myriad of ailments.\" The association says those cases are anomalies.\n\n\"The reality is, our belief is, this is America,\" Herman said. \"And if a product is useful for your health and well-being, you should have the right to take it, as long as it doesn't harm you. And we haven't seen any evidence of that harm.\"\n\nThe FDA, however, continues to warn against kratom, even suggesting that it could worsen the opioid epidemic.\n\n\"Kratom has never been studied in humans,\" Gottlieb said in the statement. \"What consumers and health care providers need to understand is that there are no proven medical uses for kratom. Instead, as the FDA has warned, kratom can cause serious harm and is contributing to the opioid crisis.\"",

    "text": "Hate speech is all over the internet. Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race -- or anything, really -- has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they'll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it's just part of internet life mean that it's critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They'll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it's hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they're drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment -- unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what's OK and what's absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today's kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech -- which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can't stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet's be clear: The internet didn't create hate speech. Although it may change some people's minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn't account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people -- and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can't -- and shouldn't -- rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don't have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family's values -- around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other -- sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.",

    "text": "(CNN) Vitamin D and omega-3 supplements do not prevent cancer or heart disease, a new study finds, the latest in the years-long debate over their benefits.\n\nThe trial enrolled more than 25,000 Americans of various ethnicities who were over the age of 50 and had no history of cancer, heart attack, stroke or other forms of heart disease.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned a daily dose of vitamin D, omega-3 or a placebo. After more than five years, no significant heart disease or cancer difference was seen between those taking supplements and those taking a placebo.\n\nLead researcher Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medincine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the study distinguishes itself because it is the world's largest randomized trial of its kind.\n\nPrevious research has looked at bone health or used high-risk populations, she added, but her study had the \"the primary aims to look if vitamin D and omega-3 could reduce risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease\" in typical people with no history of such conditions.\n\nThe results of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL -- known as VITAL -- were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2018 in Chicago and published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nVITAL's initial trial took place last year and included more than 8,000 participants.\n\nResearch has suggested that the fatty acid omega-3 could prevent cancers and cardiovascular diseases, the study says, and vitamin D has been suggested to reduce cancer risks because there are fewer cancer cases in countries with high sun exposure. Such observational studies are susceptible to confounding factors for a lower cancer rate in places where there is greater sun exposure, because people who spend more time outside are most likely also engaging in other healthy habits such as exercise.\n\n\"If you're already taking one or both of these supplements, there's no clear reason to stop. If you want to consider starting, our recommendation is to talk with your health care provider, but this does not need to be done on an urgent basis,\" Manson said.\n\nLittle protection from vitamin D\n\nThe study was a large clinical randomized trial, noted Brian Power, honorary senior dietitian at University College London Hospital and lecturer in nutrition who was not involved in the research. He described it in an email as \"the gold standard for evaluating effectiveness of interventions of this sort; bias and confounding are reduced.\"\n\nLooking at moderate to high dosages of 2,000 IU of vitamin D, 1,617 people developed cancer; of these, 793 were regular vitamin D takers, and 824 were in the placebo group.\n\nAlso, 905 participants developed major cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart attack or death from cardiovascular disease. Of them, 396 were taking vitamin D supplements daily; the placebo group had 409 cases of a major cardiovascular event.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the difference is too small and says there is no link between vitamin D and a lowered risk of major cardiovascular events or invasive cancers.\n\nAnastasia Z. Kalea, senior lecturer at the Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics at University College London who was not part of the study, said the results are \"very important but not surprising.\" Both conclusions were suspected, and the trial supports them, she added.\n\nThe study shows that it is not possible for vitamin D supplements to prevent cancer, and the differences in the placebo and vitamin D groups are minimal, Kalea said.\n\nHowever, over the course of the study, deaths from cancer were significantly reduced, by 25% for those who took vitamin D supplements. This finding needs further research, but Manson thinks it can be explained with vitamin D affecting tumor biology, making it less likely that the tumor grows and spreads.\n\nRecent research also disproved the theory that vitamin D improves bone health and prevents fractures, but some experts disagree with this, citing small time periods and sample sizes as well as insufficient dosages.\n\nSome benefit from omega-3\n\nIn the omega-3 analysis, invasive cancers were found in 820 participants taking daily supplements of 1 gram of omega-3 and in 797 who received a placebo.\n\nAlso, 386 people taking 1 gram of omega-3 experienced cardiovascular events during the study, as did 419 people taking a placebo.\n\nBut for heart attacks specifically, findings showed an overall 28% reduction in those taking omega-3 supplements. For African-Americans, the study found a 77% reduction in heart attacks linked to daily of omega-3 supplements.\n\nIn people who don't eat the recommended one or two servings of fish a week, the supplements were linked to a 40% reduction in heart attacks. But for people who followed the recommendation, there was no such association.\n\nManson recommends trying to get omega-3 from a healthy diet that incorporates fish.

    "text": "(CNN) A five-minute neck scan could predict a person's risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge, researchers have said.\n\nThe test, which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck, could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline, according to the study by scientists at University College London (UCL), who presented their work Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference.\n\nA group of almost 3,200 patients, aged 58-74, had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002, before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years, from 2002 to 2016.\n\nPeople with the most intense pulses, which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow, were up to 50% more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions, the research found, because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brain's network of blood vessels.\n\nPulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down -- usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use -- and can no longer \"cushion\" the blood flow coming from the heart.\n\n\"If you can detect [the risk] in people in mid-life, it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle,\" said Dr. Scott Chiesa, post-doctoral researcher at UCL.\n\n\"What's good for the arteries is good for the brain,\" he added in summary of his findings. \"Dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging. How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.\"\n\nIf the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.\n\nAnd the scans would be \"well set up for routine testing,\" according to Chiesa. \"It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.\"\n\nWhen healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.\n\nBut damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.\n\n\"What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,\" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.\n\nVascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.\n\nDementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.\n\nAround 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide, according to the World Health Organization , with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050.\n\nIn the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\n'Promising findings'\n\nThe study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.\n\n\"Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,\" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.\n\nBut he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: \"The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.\"\n\nThere is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.\n\n\"Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.\"\n\nPrevious studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level , but its effects remain largely incurable.\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.\n\n\"While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,\" said Routledge.\n\nRoutledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.",

    "text": "(CNN) Last year, President Donald Trump's doctors screened him for heart disease using a test unfamiliar to many Americans . Now, research shows that that test, either alone or combined with other evaluation methods, is better at predicting whether a symptomatic patient required heart surgery than the standard evaluation.\n\nThe test, a scan for coronary artery calcium or CAC, provides patients with a simple score or a quantifiable measure of how hardened their arteries have become. By contrast, the standard evaluation that doctors use to measure heart disease risk includes blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body weight, blood glucose and lifestyle factors, such as smoking status.\n\n\"If you're concerned about your risk of heart disease, then you should ask your doctor about the coronary artery calcium score,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Anderson , lead author of the new study, presented Monday at the American Heart Association Scientific Session conference. He is also a clinical and research physician and past director of cardiovascular research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nA measure of actual plaque\n\nLast year, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson revealed that as part of his physical exam, Trump had undergone a coronary calcium CT scan, a test that has been around since at least 1990. The president's score was 133, which indicates that some plaque is present and would place him in the middle-risk category as defined by the new study. The lowest-risk category includes patients with scores of zero, and the highest-risk category includes patients with scores of 1,000 or higher.\n\nAnderson said the study questioned which of three types of evaluations is the best predictor of either a major coronary event, including heart attack, or the need for surgery to place a stent or perform a bypass. He and his colleagues looked at 1,107 symptomatic patients at Intermountain Medical Center who had been referred for a positron emission tomography (PET) test.\n\n\"These are patients with low-risk symptoms. Some have coronary disease; most don't,\" Anderson explained.\n\nThe first evaluation is the current standard used by doctors. The second includes all the same factors as the standard evaluation method, along with a patient's CAC score. The third evaluation was a CAC score alone.\n\nThe researchers followed the patients in the study for 1\u00bd years to nearly three years. They discovered that the CAC score alone and the evaluation plus the CAC score did a better job of predicting who eventually needed to have bypass surgery or a stent placed than the evaluation method without the score, Anderson said.\n\nThe CAC score gives actual \"anatomic information,\" he said. \"You're actually seeing plaque -- not all the plaque, not the soft plaque, but advanced plaque where calcium is present.\"\n\nNone of the three evaluation methods did a good job of predicting heart attack risk, the study found.\n\nHeart association urges use\n\n\"I would anticipate, based on this study and the guidelines, that this will broaden the use of CAC scoring for patients at risk\" for heart attack, said Walsh, who was not involved in the study. \"And my hope is that with the guidelines coming out and this growing evidence, that patients will have Insurance coverage for the study as well.\"\n\n\"When CAC scoring was initially done, there was pretty significant radiation exposure,\" said Walsh, who is also the American College of Cardiology's immediate past president. The technology has improved today, so \"it's about the same equivalent radiation as getting a mammogram.\"\n\nThe test is like any CT scan, in which a patient lies on a table in a scanner and pictures are taken, she said. \"It doesn't cause pain. You don't have to have an IV in,\" she said. \"What we're able to see from the heart is the degree of calcification of the heart artery.\"\n\nThe higher the CAC score, the more calcium a patient has in his or her arteries and the higher the risk, she said. A score of zero shows no calcification in the coronary artery.\n\nGenerally, people who have risk factors such as \"abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, family history of heart disease, hypertension, smoking -- all those traditional risk factors -- those people have a higher chance of having an abnormal CAC score,\" Walsh said.\n\nShe noted that a high CAC score is \"not a natural progression with aging,\" though if you took a random sample of 80-year-olds, there would be more likelihood that they would have some calcium. \"But what predicts higher calcium levels is the other risk factors,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn recent years, she said, she's seen billboards advertising a \"Father's Day special\" in which people could gift their dads a CAC screening test.\n\nThough hospitals appear to have pulled back on them recently, these ad campaigns were aimed at reassuring people who feared a heart attack, she said.\n\nThe new study, combined with the new recommendation to use the test in asymptomatic patients in the middle-risk category, when \"put together, show us that this is going to be a test we're going to use more in the future,\" Walsh said.",

    "text": "(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration says another heart medicine is being voluntarily recalled after tests showed that it was tainted with a potential cancer-causing chemical.\n\nThe recall includes one lot of Sandoz's losartan potassium hydrochlorothiazide 100 milligram/25 milligram tablets with the lot number JB8912. Patients use these drugs to keep their high blood pressure in check.\n\nThe drug is being recalled because the active ingredient has tested positive for N-Nitrosodiethylamine or NDEA, a suspected human and animal carcinogen that is used in gasoline as a stabilizer for industry materials and as a lubricant additive, according to the National Institutes of Health\n\nThe ingredient was made by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Company Co. Ltd. The FDA placed the Chinese company on an import alert at the end of September, meaning all of its active pharmaceutical products and finished products will not be permitted to enter the United States. The FDA made that decision after an inspection of the facility.\n\nSeveral pills that contain valsartan , another drug used by heart patients, have been under a recall since July. The drugs were tainted with NDEA or NDMA, N-nitrosodimethylamine, an impurity that is also considered a possible carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency\n\nNDMA is an organic chemical used to make liquid rocket fuel and is a byproduct of manufacturing some pesticides and processing fish. It can be unintentionally introduced into manufacturing through certain chemical reactions.\n\nThe FDA is testing all heart drugs known as ARBs for these impurities.\n\nNot all medicine containing valsartan is recalled. The FDA keeps an ongoing list of products that are recalled and a list of the valsartan products that are not recalled.\n\nThe latest recall impacts less than 1% of the total losartan drug products in the US market, according to the FDA.\n\nIf your drug is on the recall list, the FDA suggests taking it until your doctor or pharmacist provides a replacement. Because not all valsartan and irbesartan drugs are involved in the recall, you might be able to switch to a version by another company.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what the cancer risk is if you take the contaminated valsartan pills; the FDA believed that the risk was low with the valsartan recall.\n\nIt estimated that if 8,000 people took the highest dose of valsartan (320 milligrams) containing NDMA from these recalled batches daily for four years, there may be one additional case of cancer over the lifetimes of 8,000 people. Many patients take a much lower dose of valsartan, and therefore their risks are theoretically much lower.\n\nThe FDA said it will continue to test all products containing valsartan and similar drugs for the presence of impurities.",

    "text": "(CNN) It's fall migration season, when millions of birds pass through our cities and towns on their trek south for the winter.\n\nFor me, though, the excitement about birds is year-round. Few things pull me out of a funk like the sudden appearance of a bluebird in my backyard, the vivid blue against a green magnolia tree like an exclamation point.\n\nI scramble for binoculars to get a closer look, and as I turn the focus wheel, my cloudy, scattered mind refocuses, too. The tiny indigo beauty rewards me with a chest puff, a rust-colored breast popping against the brilliant blue.\n\nThe sound of bird song and rustling leaves lead me to take a deep sip of fresh air, and the tightness in my chest disappears. My spirits, low since my mother's death, lift for now. I look skyward for the next flutter.\n\nBirding to calm the mind\n\nWhen you're birding, \"you're almost in a different world,\" said Heather Wolf, a bird guide for NYC Audubon in New York.\n\nIt's a skill of fine-tuned observation, which rewards the birder with a new perspective.\n\n\"All of the things that might be weighing you down in your daily life, it's an escape. You forget about them when you're birding,\" Wolf said.\n\nOn a recent fall Saturday, Wolf leads a group through Brooklyn Bridge Park, a mini birding oasis, complete with a stunning backdrop.\n\nShe leads the binocular-wearing birders through a paved path surrounded by foliage. You can hear the tweeting as birds dash between bushes or hop up tree trunks.\n\nWolf excitedly points out species along the walk: \"A phoebe just landed.\" \"Oh wow!! that's a woodpecker. It's a downy woodpecker. Everyone see that?\"\n\nPhotos: The joys of birdwatching Birdwatching \u2013 A bluebird is spotted in an Atlanta backyard on April 1, 2017.

Many of the birders on this walk are in their 30s, as birding increasingly draws a younger crowd.\n\nWhile 45 million Americans say they regularly observe birds, according to a US Fish and Wildlife survey, Audubon's research found that 9 million of them are between the ages of 18 and 35.\n\nCameron Shore, a 30-year-old architect, says he finds birding to be meditative -- better than even yoga -- because it's outside in nature.\n\n\"Just being able to move around and pick out a particular sound or a particular thing to watch, I find it to be more focusing than anything else,\" he said.\n\n\"I actually have a lot of difficulty calming down in the city, with all the background noise and just everything that's going on. It's a nice time to come out and spend an hour or two kind of in silence.\"\n\nEric Hazeltine, a software program manager living in Brooklyn, is on the walk with his pregnant wife.\n\n\"You really have to use all of your senses when you do it,\" he said. \"You can't even be listening to music or listening to podcasts. You have to keep your ears open and your eyes open.\"\n\nBirdwatching and your health\n\nstudy from the University of Exeter in England last year found that people living in neighborhoods with more birds and tree cover are less likely to have depression, anxiety and stress.\n\nThe study, published in the journal BioScience, surveyed more than 270 people from towns throughout southern England. Researchers found a positive association between the number of birds and trees in a neighborhood and residents' mental health, even after controlling for a neighborhood's poverty level and other demographic factors.\n\nThe study's author says the need for more exposure to nature comes at a time of unprecedented biodiversity loss, which includes more than 300 threatened bird species in North America alone.\n\nAnother study in the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that just listening to bird song contributes to perceived attention restoration and stress recovery.\n\nAnd beyond birds, there are hundreds of studies that show the health benefits of sustained exposure to nature, according to Dr. Nooshin Razani, a pediatrician and director of the Center for Nature and Health at UCSF's Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Within minutes of being in a natural setting things like cortisol, a stress hormone, improve,\" Razani said.\n\n\"Within 15 minutes, the ability to solve puzzles and cognitive benefits are seen. Even attention seems to get better. At around that time, blood pressure improves and so does pulse.\"\n\nRazani notes that a lifetime of regular exposure to nature -- whether walking in a park or camping in a forest -- is associated with improvements in cardiovascular disease and longevity.\n\nThen there are the health benefits of birding in a group, since multiple studies show that social connections and friendships are key to a long, healthy life. Sharing a hobby you're passionate about can connect you to others.\n\n\"A lot of times, when you're birding, you'll notice someone else with binoculars, and you can make new friends that way,\" Wolf said.\n\nAnd there's a huge birding community awaiting you.\n\n\"I follow a few people's blogs and Instagram to see what birds they're seeing,\" said Amanda Warco, a 33-year-old Brooklyn educator who goes birding with her husband. \"I like that it is a community and it's another way to get to know people who live around me that I probably wouldn't have any other interaction with.\"\n\nGrab some binoculars and look up\n\nYou don't have to take a trip to Costa Rica to go birding. You can do it in your own backyard. In fact, backyard birders are the largest group of wildlife watchers in the country ; 39 million Americans do it that way.\n\nOr you can explore your own city. Birding can take you to new neighborhoods.\n\n\"I really would encourage anyone to just take a closer look at the trees in your neighborhood, especially around fall and spring,\" Wolf said.\n\nBrie Stotler, a 39-year-old physician, hopes that as more Americans develop an interest in birdwatching, they'll become more concerned about the environment.\n\n\"Caring about the birds, you naturally start to think ... 'Well, do they have things to eat? Do they have a place to go?' And then that takes your thoughts to, 'What kind of parks do I have in the city?' or 'Are we preserving their natural habitat where they go to breed?' \"\n\nMy bird habit started with observing flashes of blue, red and yellow through my sunroom windows. My partner bought me some binoculars, and my interest grew.\n\nI was surprised to see so many colors and types of birds visiting every day. I ran to my bird guides to learn their names and match the pictures with my observations. Now, I know many of them by heart: robins, blue jays, Carolina wrens, titmouses, phoebes and my favorites, the tiny warblers, all 4 inches of them.\n\nThey flit so fast from branch to branch, often showing flashes of yellow, that it takes all my focus to capture them in my sights. This pulls into the moment, face to face with nature. Each bird has a sweetness, and their behavior becomes familiar and reassuring.\n\nNow, I photograph them, too.\n\nRecently, a surprise visit from a red-tailed hawk, whose soaring wingspan threw a shadow over my yard, drew me out of the house with binoculars to look skyward. His majestic soaring across the clouds lifted my spirit once again.",

    "text": "(CNN) After her 15-year-old son ended up \"in critical and life-threatening condition\" from an adenovirus outbreak at a New Jersey health care facility, one mother is suing those who she believes allowed her son to end up in the ICU, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\n\nPaula Costigan's son, William DelGrosso, was one of dozens of medically fragile children who were infected with the virus beginning in late September at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, New Jersey.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, DelGrosso came down with a fever on October 11 and was transferred to the intensive care unit at Hackensack University Medical Center on October 18 with \"serious respiratory complications.\" He is still there now, according to the family's lawyer, Paul da Costa.\n\n\"As a mother, it's hard enough to not have your child under your own roof and have to trust and rely on a facility to care for your child,\" da Costa said, adding that Costigan \"feels as if the facility was trying to hide the fact there was this serious virus spreading like wildfire.\"\n\nThe Wanaque Center declined a request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\n'Kids like William'\n\nCostigan doesn't know where her son will go when he's stable enough to be discharged from intensive care, da Costa said.\n\nDelGrosso, who has a seizure disorder, has required a ventilator to breathe since he was about 10 years old, when he went into cardiac arrest after a major seizure, da Costa said.\n\nThere are four long-term care facilities in New Jersey that cater to children, according to a state health department database. This includes the Wanaque Center and the Voorhees Pediatric Facility, where seven kids have been infected with a milder strain of adenovirus, according to the state health department. There have been no deaths among the Voorhees patients.\n\nCostigan doesn't want her son to go back to the Wanaque facility, but she's been told that the other centers in the state that accept Medicaid and are equipped to take care of a ventilator-dependent child like her son may have up to a one-year wait list, according to da Costa.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the facility neglected to provide the care DelGrosso needed when it came to preventing such an infection from spreading.\n\n\"At the time of the initial case of adenovirus,\" the lawsuit alleges, the facility \"did not have proper infection prevention and control programs, protocols, or procedures in place to remedy the infection and prevent it from spreading throughout its pediatric residents.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that the facility didn't send patients to acute care hospitals in a timely manner or notify parents earlier, around the time when it first contacted the state health department about the outbreak, on October 9.\n\nCostigan told da Costa that \"she was never informed that her son had high fevers several days before they ultimately told her that he needed to be transferred immediately to an acute care hospital\" on October 18, he said. And she wasn't notified about the adenovirus outbreak until a form letter arrived in the mail four days later, he added.\n\nIn statements last month, the Wanaque facility said that it's working alongside health experts to investigate the outbreak and that it \"promptly notified all appropriate government agencies when the virus was initially identified.\" The facility did not respond to earlier requests for further comment.\n\nDa Costa says the lawsuit isn't just about Costigan's son; it's about \"kids like William who have the inability to speak for themselves and to care for themselves.\"\n\nThe lawsuit references health inspections dating back several years, including an unannounced inspection on October 21 that found deficient hand hygiene practices among staff. This inspection was conducted after health officials had been alerted by the facility but before the health department publicly announced any deaths.\n\nThe facility has received and corrected other deficiencies in the past, including improperly stored syringes, which were used to measure liquid medication, and over-bed tables and medication trays that were not properly cleaned and disinfected.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last month, New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal described these as \"low-level, self-limited deficiencies\" that were resolved when health inspectors rechecked.\n\nIn a review by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Wanaque Center was awarded an above-average ranking in overall quality but a below-average health inspection rating. The rating is based on two years of inspections before November 2017. The Wanaque facility's deficiencies have consistently been lower in number than the US average.\n\n\"It is rare that in any inspection a facility would come out with no citations,\" Elnahal said. \"If it's a number of citations, all of which are low-level, we ask for a plan of correction. We make sure the facility follows through -- and that's what this facility did here.\n\n\"If the findings are severe enough to take further action, we will,\" he added.\n\nThe infections and deaths come amid questions -- from former Wanaque Center employees , the mother of one of the children who died, and Elnahal himself -- about whether current facility standards are high enough and whether more could have been done to prevent this from happening.\n\nElnahal previously said in a statement that the findings of the most recent health inspection at the Wanaque facility \"raise questions about whether these general longterm care standards are optimal for this vulnerable population of medically fragile children.\"\n\n\"We also need to think about whether there is more we can do as healthcare leaders to protect immunocompromised children, such as those served at Wanaque Center,\" he said.\n\n\"Every year in the state, there are hundreds of outbreaks at healthcare facilities.\"\n\n'We are taking aggressive steps'\n\nAdenoviruses are often spread by touching a contaminated person or surface, or through the air by coughing or sneezing. They are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments for long periods of time, and they may not be eliminated by common disinfectants, but they rarely cause severe illness in healthy people.\n\nHowever, people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk for severe disease, and they may remain contagious long after they recover, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSymptoms may appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus.\n\nAt the Wanaque facility, the patients with confirmed cases became ill between September 26 and November 8, according to the health department. The number has risen from 18 cases, including six deaths, announced last month by the health department.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe outbreak in the Wanaque facility was caused by adenovirus type 7. This type is \"most commonly associated with acute respiratory disease,\" according to the CDC. Other types of adenovirus infections can cause flu-like symptoms, pinkeye and diarrhea.\n\nHealth officials say they are stepping up efforts to strengthen infection control at such facilities in the state. The health department announced plans last week to deploy a team of infection control experts to visit University Hospital and four pediatric long-term care facilities this month, including the Wanaque and Voorhees facilities, where experts will train staff and evaluate how these facilities prevent and control infections.\n\n\"Facility outbreaks are not always preventable, but in response to what we have seen in Wanaque, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the chance they occur among the most vulnerable patients in New Jersey,\" Elnahal said in a statement last week.\n\nThe facility has been \"instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance,\" according to the state health department. State health officials have said the outbreak can be declared over only when four weeks pass without an additional case.\n\n\"It can be difficult to impossible to know how the virus got to the facility, what its source was, or what its specific mechanism of spread is from person to person,\" Elnahal said.",

She also revealed how she was left to give herself the necessary shots when her husband was off fulfilling his duties in the state Legislature.\n\n\"I felt lost and alone, and I felt like I failed,\" she told Robin Roberts in an interview that ran Friday on \"Good Morning America .\" \"I didn't know how common miscarriages were, because we don't talk about them. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we're broken.\"\n\nWhat Obama articulates is \"so universal, not just throughout the US but around the world,\" says Dr. Zev Williams, director of the Columbia University Fertility Center. \"There's a real sense of self-blame and guilt and a reluctance to discuss it with other people.\"\n\nWilliams co-authored a 2015 study looking into public perceptions of miscarriage . Even though he says miscarriage or pregnancy loss occurs in at least 20% of all pregnancies, 55% of those who responded to his survey thought miscarriage was rare, occurring in 5% or less of pregnancies, and some believed that they occur \"in under 0.1% of pregnancies,\" he said.\n\nNot only are miscarriages common, they are \"in almost all cases\" not the mother's fault, Williams added.

As well, they turn to these approaches for a general sense of wellbeing,\" Richard Nahin , the lead epidemiologist at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and co-author of the reports, wrote in an email.\n\nThe reports, which were compiled using data from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Health Interview Survey , looked at the use of yoga, meditation and chiropractors between 2012 and 2017.\n\nThe practice of yoga rose from 3.1% of the overall child population in 2012 to 8.4% in 2017 and from 9.5% to 14.3% in adults, equating to about 4.9 million children and 35.2 million adults doing yoga in 2017.\n\nMeditation use went up from 0.6% of children in 2012 to 5.4% in 2017 and from 4.1% of adults in 2012 to 14.2% of adults in 2017.\n\nThe use of chiropractors in children stayed essentially the same -- about 3.5% of children visited chiropractors in both years. There was a small difference for adults, from 9.1% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2017.\n\nMore females are doing yoga in both age groups in 2017: 11.3% of girls, compared with 5.6% of boys, and 19.8% of women, compared with 8.6% of men.\n\nMeditation and chiropractors were more popular with adult women surveyed, but in children, the rates of use between boys and girls were similar.\n\nAmong children, those between 12 and 17, were the most likely to either meditate or visit a chiropractor.\n\nFor adults, yoga was found to be most popular with 18- to 44-year-olds, and meditation and chiropractors were used most by those in the 45-to-64 age group.\n\nRacially, white non-Hispanics were the most likely to use all three methods in both age groups.\n\nThough the patterns of use were the same as in previous years for children, according to the report, there were changes in adult usage.\n\n\"The popularity of meditation surpassed that of seeing a chiropractor to become the second most-used approach among those examined in 2017,\" the report said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAll three methods of complementary medicine appear to have health benefits, Nahin said.

    "text": "This story was investigated by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and edited and published in partnership with CNN.\n\nKandahar, Afghanistan (CNN) As the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq evolved, military doctors grappling to treat soldiers maimed by roadside bombs began facing another challenge: Their patients were developing almost incurable, multidrug-resistant infections in their wounds. They couldn't be treated with the usual antibiotics the doctors had on hand.\n\nUS Army Col. Clinton Murray, 48, an infectious-diseases doctor, was deployed to the region four times between 2003 and 2015, working in military hospitals and clinics across the country.\n\nHe said that drug-resistant or \"superbug\" infections meant some soldiers had problems for years after their initial life-altering injuries. When common antibiotics failed, higher doses of antibiotics, new drug combinations or alternative drugs with severe side effects were tried, but many had repeat and prolonged infections. Others had to undergo extra surgeries or amputations to stop the bacteria from spreading further.\n\nThe US Army soon realized that drug resistance was a serious problem and, from 2009, introduced programs to reduce drug resistance in its military hospitals -- but the problem was just as bad, if not worse, in nearby civilian hospitals.\n\nWhen things got really bad for the Army, soldiers were evacuated to two US hospitals. One was Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas, where Murray also ran the infectious-diseases department.\n\nCivilians, however, had fewer resources and no way out.\n\nAfghan citizens are dying because of the war, and drug resistance will mean even more deaths, said Dr. Nasimullah Bawar, head of health programme at BRAC Afghanistan , a nongovernmental organization providing drugs and maternity, child health, immunization, nutrition, mental health and malaria and TB-control services in four provinces.\n\nBawar compares superbugs to another scourge, the Islamic State or Daesh, because it will disrupt the country and kill many citizens: \"This is going to be another Daesh, I can say.\"\n\nMaking the situation even tougher is 40 years of conflict.\n\nA military struggle against 'Iraqibacter'\n\nMilitary doctors started noticing an influx of patients with multidrug-resistant infections from 2003, two years after the Afghanistan war started, but it was years before the Army identified the scope of the problem.\n\nInfections from a resistant form of one type of bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, became so common in Iraq and then Afghanistan that the soldiers gave it a nickname: \"Iraqibacter.\" The bug had usually been a problem in older or very sick patients who had spent months in the hospital, but doctors were now seeing it in young, fit soldiers, commonly in blast wounds.\n\nAt the peak of the problem, between 2004 and 2006, the budget for one class of last-resort antibiotics called carbapenems, used for severe and multidrug-resistant infections, went up more than 400%.\n\nThe use of another drug, colistin, called the \"last hope\" drug because of its use on critically ill patients, became so common that the Army had to restrict it.\n\nSomething had to change.\n\nTargeted control programs were introduced in 2009 and included guidelines on antibiotic use, better surveillance of drug resistance, improved record-keeping and better infection control. Resistance was reduced to pre-war levels within six years.\n\n\"I have folks I've been following for 10 to 15 years,\" Murray said. \"First couple of years, we wrestled with infection. Then, for the next 11, they've done great. They live functional lives.\"\n\nSpecialist care meant soldiers were being saved from superbug infections.\n\nMurray recalls one patient who lost both his legs after being hit by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Three weeks after the blast, after evacuation to the US, infections developed in his stumps.\n\nDoctors swabbed the wounds and found a plethora of dangerous organisms, including three types of multidrug-resistant bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as Staphylococcus aureus. To stem these infections, they had to give him antibiotics that caused kidney failure, though his organs recovered after the drug therapy was stopped a few days later.\n\nBut the patient went on to develop more infections.\n\nOn one occasion, the antibiotics poisoned his bone marrow, which affects the body's immunity and clotting. He was given a different antibiotic that cleared the infection in that stump, and fortunately, the poisoning did not turn out to be permanent. However, he soon developed an infection in his other stump.\n\nDoctors suggested more surgery to cut away the infected part of his leg, but he opted instead to take antibiotics long-term to quash the infection.\n\nNow, 12 years after being hit, he still has to take antibiotics to keep the infection at bay, but he lives a normal life with prosthetic legs. \"His kids and my kids knew each other, and now they're in college and doing great,\" Murray said.\n\nBut the gains made in military hospitals were not transferred to public facilities, which still struggle with drug-resistant infections.\n\nThe health system in Afghanistan has been fragmented by decades of war. Civilian hospitals are understaffed, underfunded and overburdened, and superbugs made the civilian population in war zones an object of fear, said Dr. Christian Haggenmiller, a former senior NATO medical officer in Afghanistan.\n\nThough Army staff were prioritized at military hospitals, some Afghan citizens were also treated there because so many were injured in the conflict and local hospitals were often inaccessible or in poor condition. Many military facilities carried out life-saving treatment on locals but then referred them to public hospitals for rehabilitation.\n\nMilitary medical facilities sometimes rejected civilian patients because of fear that they carried resistant bacteria that could infect the intensive care unit for military personnel, Haggenmiller said. As a result, they were often treated separately in isolation tents, away from the main medical facilities.\n\n\"It's your worst nightmare, having a drug-resistant strain in your health facility that you can't control. It's like a new disease,\" Haggenmiller said.\n\nAntibiotic addiction\n\nAfghanistan has some of the worst health outcomes in the world. One woman dies every two hours from pregnancy-related causes, according to conservative estimates by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), and one in 25 newborn babies dies, the third highest neonatal death rate in the world, UNICEF figures show.\n\nLife expectancy at birth is 64, compared with 79 in the US and a global average of 72. There is a shortage of doctors, especially in rural areas, and infection control is poor.\n\nDrug resistance has become one of the world's greatest public health crises, estimated to cause 700,000 deaths worldwide and expected to kill 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken.\n\nFueling the superbug problem in Afghanistan is the unregulated sale of antibiotics in human medicine and in agriculture. Drugs are advertised on television and available to buy over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription or diagnosis from a doctor.\n\n\"They give them out like sweets,\" said Dr. Doris Burtscher, a medical anthropologist at Medecins Sans Frontieres. Burtscher compiled a report in 2015 about attitudes to antibiotics at a public hospital in Kabul and found that the drugs were taken for such issues as bruised knees, nosebleeds and body pain, as well as by women after menstruating.\n\nA 'typical case'\n\nDrs. Niamatullah Lodin and Younas Joyan describe a typical case from April at Mohmand hospital in Kandahar, the country's second-biggest city.\n\nMohmand is a glass-fronted private hospital that provides free public health care during the month of Ramadan and thus treats a surge of patients during this time.\n\nA 35-year-old woman was brought to the hospital, unconscious and in a coma, by her family. She had given birth three days earlier and developed an infection. The bacteria got into her bloodstream, causing life-threatening septic shock. Lodin and Joyan gave her three antibiotics -- ceftriaxone, vancomycin and metronidazole -- but there was no improvement.\n\nPatients at Antoni Infectious Disease Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nThe two doctors checked her white blood cell count, an indicator of immune activity in response to microbes in the blood. A normal level is between 400 and 1,000. Hers was 19,000 and didn't fall as expected after being given antibiotics. She had a severe and resistant infection.\n\nThe woman had lost a lot of blood after giving birth; her blood volume fell rapidly, and her kidneys began to fail.\n\nThe doctors were forced to give her linezolid, an antibiotic used only for serious and resistant infections, as it is toxic and can have dangerous side effects. A long course will suppress the bone marrow, which will cause bleeding due to a low platelet count, anemia due to a lack of red blood cells and increased susceptibility to further infections due to a low white blood cell count. The drug is also poisonous to the kidneys and can cause severe skin rashes. Patients have died from the side effects.\n\n\"Giving linezolid to the patient was a difficult decision for us because it is a very strong antibiotic,\" said Joyan, an internal medicine specialist. \"But when we saw her resistance against vancomycin and ceftriaxone, we were obligated to give her linezolid, because it was the last option for us. If we didn't give her linezolid, she would have died.\"\n\nFortunately, this antibiotic worked; the woman's pulse returned to normal, and she started eating again a day later. \"The patient and her family were too pleased for what we did,\" said Lodin, a pediatric specialist at Mohmand. As the family was poor, the hospital didn't charge for care.\n\nBut not all patients who arrive at the hospital are so lucky.\n\nLodin and Joyan said they see patients with drug-resistant infections from Streptococcus and Klebsiella bacteria who have died. Around 15% of infections are drug-resistant, commonly in patients with pneumonia, kidney infections and digestive system infections that do not respond. The most common multidrug-resistant infections seen are from E. coli or TB bacteria, they said.\n\nAn estimated 1,400 people developed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Afghanistan in 2016, according to WHO, although only 138 were detected and treated.\n\n'Other doctors not having the guts to work here'\n\nIn Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, Dr. Mohammad Saber Hotak is head of pharmaceuticals at the public Antoni Infectious Disease Hospital.\n\nThe hospital is cramped and unclean. Very ill or unconscious patients lie in beds, their hospital gowns and sheets stained with fluids. It smells of vomit and illness. There is nowhere for families to sleep, so they do so outside the hospital. Just one of the hospital's two machines to give the results of a full blood count, needed to diagnose certain infections or diseases and monitor the effects of treatment, is functional.\n\nHotak says the number of multidrug-resistant infections he has seen has increased by 20% in the past five years.\n\nDr. Mohammad Saber Hotak is head of pharmaceuticals at Antoni Infectious Disease Hospital.\n\nAbout 150 patients a day are treated at the Antoni, many in very poor health. The hospital deals with a daunting range of infections including rabies, meningitis, TB, malaria, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, yellow fever, anthrax, bubonic plague, measles, chicken pox, polio and respiratory infections like pneumonia. It also has to contend with outbreaks of cholera.\n\nIn addition, the hospital battles these contagious diseases with a very limited supply of medicine. It has basic supplies of antibiotics and fluids, but all other drugs have to be purchased by patients or their caretakers, usually from the pharmacy outside. This is the case in most hospitals in Afghanistan, though in other developing countries, patients hospitalized with infections rarely pay for drugs or supplies.\n\nAbout 15% of patients treated at the Antoni have an antibiotic-resistant infection. Hotak said most infections are resistant to \"normal\" antibiotics, and his teams are now seeing resistance to vancomycin, the last-resort drug used to treat multidrug-resistant infections from enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThe vancomycin-resistant form of these two superbugs is on WHO's list of bacteria for which new antibiotics are urgently needed.\n\nHotak, 48, has worked at the Antoni hospital for nearly 20 years. \"That is due to other doctors not having the guts to work here due to the nature of the hospital, contagious diseases, and those of us who work here had to stay, I guess,\" he said.\n\n\"When you see a patient dying because of complications or resistance to drugs, it makes me feel sad that I couldn't do anything to treat him or her,\" said Dr. Mohammad Sadiq Naimi, head trainer and doctor at the Antoni hospital. \"It has its negative impacts on the brain.\"\n\nOveruse and misuse\n\nOveruse and misuse of antibiotics is the main factor fueling resistance worldwide.\n\nIn Afghanistan, there is a strong cultural trend toward taking antibiotics, Burtscher said.. There is a belief that the dirty and dusty environment in the country causes \"disease\" in the body and that antibiotics are needed to \"clean\" it. People take them for nonbacterial conditions, like colds or general body weakness, while women are given them after delivering a baby, she said.\n\nPatients travel miles to buy drugs, and families stockpile them for when relatives get sick.\n\nAntoni Infectious Disease Hospital in Kabul.\n\nIn addition, pharmacists do not always follow the regulations around prescribing the right drug or the full dose, which further fuels resistance. Patients are able to buy just one tablet of an antibiotic if they wish, but taking an incomplete course of antibiotics means the infection is not killed, and the most drug-resistant bacteria survive and replicate.\n\nThere is also a problem with counterfeit and substandard antibiotics smuggled in from Pakistan or Iran. These contain either none of the active ingredient or less than the advertised dose, again fueling resistance because a low dose means not all the bacteria will be killed by the drug, and the resistant ones will survive and spread.\n\nThe perception of substandard drugs can also cause some doctors to prescribe higher amounts.\n\nAn unknown scale\n\nLike most public hospitals in Afghanistan, the Antoni does not have a formalized database to keep track of patients, their illnesses or resistance patterns to antibiotics, and so there is no empirical data to enable useful surveillance. Information is captured in handwritten books.\n\nTo find out how many patients have died, you would have to go through the notebooks one by one, Naimi said.\n\nSimilarly, across Afghanistan, nobody knows the scale of the superbug problem because there is no centralized system for recording the most common infections and their resistance patterns.\n\nDr. Mohammad Sadiq Naimi, head trainer and doctor at the Antoni hospital, in his office.\n\nThe US military was in the same position during the first eight years of the war. Dr. Emil Lesho, a retired colonel who led the US Army's antimicrobial resistance program, found that Army medical records had no code to record resistant infections, so nobody knew the true scale of the problem. Many facilities didn't have the ability to identify resistant bacteria.\n\nIn 2009, he set up a centralized laboratory to which all branches of the military could send bacteria samples, which also acted as a surveillance system: the Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network.\n\nDoctors could find out exactly what was causing a patient's infection and the antibiotics that would be effective, so they could provide more targeted treatment.\n\nLesho credits the network with reducing hospital infections and improving infection control through monitoring bacteria and giving feedback to facilities.\n\nThe same has not been possible in public hospitals, as data is much more scarce.\n\nA handful of studies show an emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in public hospitals in Afghanistan, echoing trends across the Middle East. One study , from two public hospitals in Kabul, found that 56% of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were resistant to methicillin, the main drug used to fight it, with the majority of these bacteria resistant to multiple drugs. Across the US, the proportion is 46%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nTo quantify the problem, you need a surveillance system like the military's, with laboratories equipped with the technology and staff to grow microbes and perform tests to see which antibiotics will work against them. Afghanistan has only 14 public microbiology labs in seven provinces. More labs are set to open this year, but even then, 20 out of 34 provinces will still have no access to public facilities.\n\nAmongst the existing labs, the quality between public and private labs can vary, meaning doctors do not always send samples of a patient's infection to a lab.\n\n\"Some of them, and they say 'Oh, if I send a sample to the laboratory, I don't rely on the evidence,' \" said Dr. Safiullah Nadeeb, WHO's lead on antimicrobial resistance in Afghanistan. Stressed doctors are often also trying to treat 100 patients a day and so don't have time to send off for tests, he added.\n\nLab staff at the Antoni hospital examine a urine sample.\n\nNadeeb is trying to improve infection control in Afghan hospitals by introducing guidelines on how to perform procedures in a sanitary way, how to clean the hospital adequately and how to dispose of waste hygienically, as well as establish a surveillance system for resistant bacteria.\n\nThe country has also enrolled in WHO's Global Antibiotic Surveillance System, in which countries all around the world will submit data under the same protocols. Four sites in Afghanistan have been selected and will gather data to international standards. \"Maybe by next year, we will have very good data,\" Nadeeb said. Until then, \"we are not able to report resistance, and we are not able to address the issue.\"\n\nImproving surveillance and infection control were two of the key changes made by the US Army in its program to reduce superbugs -- a luxury that civilian hospitals cannot imagine.\n\nFinding solutions during a war\n\nThe US military's Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research program paved the way for how superbugs to be controlled in the absence of new drugs.\n\nOver six years, doctors worked to lower resistance rates: improving hygiene and infection control, isolating patients when they came into the hospital until they had been tested for drug resistance, introducing better record-keeping around the antibiotics patients had received and reducing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nThe program started with an annual budget of a $1.5 million, which doubled within a year. It spent an additional $6 million on genetic testing of microbes, linking the results to clinical data.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor public hospitals in Afghanistan, implementing even low-cost infection control measures has been difficult. More than 88,000 civilians have been killed or injured during the conflict since 2009, when the UN started reporting casualties.\n\n\"If you go to some hospitals and say 'why can't you apply these measures of infection prevention,' they will say, 'I don't have chlorine. I don't have gloves,' \" Nadeeb said.\n\nEven in a top-down, command-and-control system like the US military, it still took six years for improvements, some very basic, to take effect, highlighted Liz Tayler, a technical expert on antimicrobial resistance with WHO.\n\n\"The fact that it still took so much time in a military setting shows what a tough time developing countries are going to have in tackling the problem,\" she said.",

    "text": "(CNN) Voters in 37 states had more than candidates to choose Tuesday. There were more than 150 statewide measures on ballots this midterm election , and several involved health-related issues such as taxes on feminine hygiene products, Medicaid expansion, abortion access and legalizing the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana. Based on the preliminary vote results, here's what some voters went for and what they rejected.\n\nAbortion\n\nAlabama's Amendment 2 adds language to the state Constitution to give a fetus the same rights as a human who has been born.\n\nAbortion rights supporters worry that the amendment could be used to criminalize some forms of in-vitro fertilization and contraception. There are also concerns that should the US Supreme Court end Roe v. Wade, this amendment would be a \"trigger ban,\" meaning abortion would be outlawed in some states.\n\nThis \"personhood\" ballot measure doesn't have exemptions like in other states' laws that carve out the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1 narrowly passed . Also known as the No Constitutional Right to Abortion Amendment, it explicitly states that its Constitution has nothing in it that \"secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" Unlike Alabama's law, it has an exception for rape, incest, fetal anomaly or threats to the woman's life. It also restricts Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nMarijuana\n\nAdult recreational users of weed will be able to use it legally in another state.\n\nAccording to preliminary results, more than 54% of voters i n Michigan said yes to the initiative that imposes a 10-ounce limit for Michigan residents, creates a state licensing system, will allow for retail sales subject to a 10% tax and changes several weed-related violations to civil infractions.\n\nThat makes 10 states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington -- plus the District of Columbia that allow for recreational use.\n\nOther states' weed-related initiatives focused on medical marijuana; prior to the election, 31 states and the District of Columbia had laws that legalize or decriminalize it.\n\nMissouri had three medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot this year. Voters gave a definite yes to Amendment 2 , which legalizes medical marijuana, taxes it at 4% and guarantees that the money will be spent on health care services for veterans. Amendment 3 and Proposition C , which would also have legalized medical use but would have spent the tax revenue differently, failed.\n\nHealth care\n\nmostly Republican-dominated states, voted yes to expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level. In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase. Voters in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska mostly Republican-dominated states, voted yes to expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level. In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase.\n\ndoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion. Montana voters appear to be rejecting Medicaid expansion, but they are still counting votes on this initiative. Montana's I-185 would have also raised taxes on tobacco products to help fund the expansion and other health care programs. The tobacco industry has spent millions in the state to fight the initiative since it would havedoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion.\n\nOther health care initiatives were on the ballot in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada.\n\nauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Voters gave a resounding yes to California's Proposition 4 , which willauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Proposition 11 , which requires people who work on ambulances to stay on call during breaks and require employers to give EMTs and paramedics additional training and some paid mental health services.\n\nCalifornia voters rejected Proposition 8 , which would have required dialysis clinics to refund patients for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care.\n\nthe number of patients assigned to It appears that voters rejected Question 1 in Massachusetts that would have limitedthe number of patients assigned to registered nurses working in a hospital.

MUST WATCH The history of running records 01:06\n\nThe world often hears the inspiring stories of elite athletes who finish first after running 26.2 miles in marathon races. For instance, Olympic medalist Shalane Flanagan broke the finish line tape at the New York City Marathon last year, becoming the first American woman to do so in 40 years. This year's marathon is scheduled to kick off Sunday morning.\n\nYet there are equally inspiring stories among the athletes who make up the back of the pack. As Peter Ciaccia, director of the New York City Marathon , puts it, \"for every runner, there's a story.\"\n\n\"They have their own reasons why they're doing what they're doing and they're putting in all that time and energy to train,\" he said. \"Every one of those folks that crossed the finish line are inspiring, from the first to the final finish.\"\n\nOn average, it takes bout 4\u00bd hours for men and women to complete a marathon, Ciaccia said, but that time can vary drastically among racers.\n\nIn honor of Sunday's New York City Marathon , where more than 50,000 people traveled through the five boroughs, here are four inspirational stories from the last racers in half- and full marathons.\n\nOne thing they have in common: They never gave up.\n\n'Even when I was able-bodied, I took plenty for granted'\n\nAs Simon Kindleysides, 34, took his first steps in the London Marathon in April, it felt as if magic was in the air.\n\n\"As we were walking toward the first mile, we actually started blending in with all the runners,\" he said. \"Everyone was on the streets, cheering, and that was a magical moment.\"\n\nAs time went on, the crowds and other racers dispersed. Kindleysides and his team of eight supporters continued walking.\n\nSimon Kindleysides became the first paralyzed man to complete the 2018 Virgin Money London Marathon on foot.\n\nKindleysides, who is paralyzed from the waist down and typically uses a wheelchair , was equipped with an exoskeleton to help him walk. His supporters walked with him to change the batteries in his exoskeleton so he could keep moving.\n\n\"I can walk up to four miles consecutively on one charge of the battery,\" he said.\n\nIn 2013, Kindleysides was diagnosed with a brain tumor -- a benign glioma -- that was growing in a way that pressed on certain nerves, leading to him losing feeling in his legs. He was told he would never walk again.\n\nBefore his paralysis, the London-based singer and dancer had \"always wanted to run a marathon,\" he said, but he never made the plans to do so -- until this year.\n\n\"Even when I was able-bodied, I took plenty for granted,\" Kindleysides said. \"You realize the time you wasted on things you didn't need to waste your time on.\"\n\nDuring the London Marathon, the last two miles were the hardest.\n\n\"At that point, I was exhausted. It was freezing cold, and I was hurting and emotional,\" Kindleysides said, but he kept going.\n\n\"I guess I didn't want to let people down. I had a team of eight of us, and I was raising money for The Brain Tumour Charity ,\" he said. \"I didn't want to let them down, myself down, and I thought if I'd get this far, I'd have to continue.\"\n\nSo he continued and made history as the first paralyzed man to complete the London Marathon on foot.\n\nOnce Kindleysides crossed the finish line, a live news crew interviewed him, and \"I said, 'I need a full body massage and a J\u00e4gerbomb.' I pinch myself. Why would I say that on live TV? I don't know. I wasn't really thinking,\" he said. \"My brain went mashed potato.\"\n\nThen, recovering at home, he shared his accomplishment with his three children.\n\n\"I was called RoboCop, Terminator and every superhero you can possibly imagine,\" Simon said.\n\n\"They used to say I'm the only dad in their whole school who's in a wheelchair, and now they say I'm their dad, the only one who has walked a marathon,\" he said. \"It was amazing, emotional, just to think I'd done it and to prove anything is possible. ... There's no such thing as can't.\"\n\nKindleysides is training to complete three more marathons next year, including the London Marathon again.\n\nMeanwhile, a final finisher in the United States is preparing to run his 11th New York City Marathon on Sunday.\n\n'Every year, I run the race for my wife'\n\nDavid Fraser, who was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, had competed in the New York Marathon before. Racing wasn't new to him, but being the final finisher last year was -- and he enjoyed the moment.\n\nFraser said that last year he was focused on his personal training company and didn't devote as much time to training for the marathon as he normally does.\n\n\"My wife and my kids were there. They meet me at the end of my race every year, and they couldn't believe I was the last one, because I had done many races. I had done 5K, I had done half-marathons, I had even done ultras -- but never have I done that,\" said the 51-year-old New Yorker who owns a company called Nightwarriors Fitness\n\n\"But you know what? They were happy to see me complete it,\" he said of his family. \"At the start of every marathon, I have one goal -- and my goal is to complete it. I don't care about time. I care about completing the race.\"\n\nDavid Fraser at the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon. He has participated in the race every year since 2007.\n\nCerebral palsy , a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and body movement, impacts much of Fraser's body -- but that hasn't stopped him from pursuing his love of fitness.\n\nBefore 2007, he spent much of his free time weightlifting and bodybuilding, but that year, his co-workers challenged him to run the New York Marathon. He took on the challenge and completed the race.\n\nHe has set out to finish it every year since.\n\n\"That next year, 2008, my wife developed stomach cancer, and now every year, I run the race for my wife,\" said Fraser, whose wife still attends his races.\n\nHe even developed a strategy: \"Ninety percent of the race, I do backwards,\" he said. \"Because when I go downhill, I go forward, but when I go uphill and when I do even terrain, I go backwards. ... I always run that way.\"\n\nOverall, Fraser said, \"The thing that's the most difficult part of running a marathon is not the physical. The most difficult part is the mental. The reason is because when your body gives up and you are done, really done, you now have to talk yourself back into it.\"\n\nFraser is preparing to complete the New York Marathon on Sunday, and he's looking forward to the race.\n\n\"All runners are out of their minds,\" he joked. \"Think about it. Who gets up early in the morning to run 26.2 miles? But we love it.\"\n\nAs for one runner in Atlanta, not only does she love it, it has been a \"lifesaver.\"\n\n'There's nothing I would change'\n\nAmina Abdul-Jalil started running last year, around the time her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\"I realized in that time, I don't think it was even the whole month, that I had gained 10 pounds, and I was just stressed, and I thought, 'I need to do something now, or this isn't going to end well,' \" Abdul-Jalil said.\n\nSo she joined a running group called Black Girls Run\n\n\"To be completely honest, it's been a lifesaver in a very real way, because I have major depressive disorder ,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Exercise may help reduce depression Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Exercise may help reduce depression 03:03\n\nAs she continued running with the group, an opportunity arose to join in an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called The Race , but Abdul-Jalil was hesitant. Then she saw a video clip of ultramarathon runner Mirna Valerio , a runner with a body type similar to her own.\n\n\"I was like, 'she runs like me' -- and that was a big moment for me,\" Abdul-Jalil said. \"So I was like 'maybe, maybe, maybe I could pull this off.' \"\n\nThen she registered for The Race and trained for 12 weeks.\n\nJUST WATCHED Runner leads the way for overweight athletes Replay More Videos ...

Watching her finish the race is what inspired me to seek out the stories of final finishers. She told me that she ran the race simply to see whether she could do it.\n\n\"Running is something that I didn't think I'd ever be able to do because I was a kid with horrible asthma,\" said the 41-year-old mother, who lives in the Atlanta area.\n\n\"And I'm not FloJo-built,\" she added, referencing late track-and-field athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner , who holds the 100-meter and 200-meter dash world records for women.\n\nAmina Abdul-Jalil was the final finisher at the 2018 The Race half-marathon in Atlanta.\n\nOver the 13.1-mile course, Abdul-Jalil listened to a playlist that included songs like Twenty One Pilots' \"Ride\" and Outkast's \"B.O.B.\"\n\nAround mile three, a medical director approached her, indicating that her pace was such that the finish line might close before she got there. If that were to happen, Abdul-Jalil might not receive medical assistance if she needed it, the medical director said.\n\nIn that moment, Abdul-Jalil felt discouraged.\n\n\"I wanted to cry and quit, and it took maybe another two miles to get that out of my head,\" she said. To keep her going, she thought about the running group, Black Girls Run.\n\n\"I literally went back to conversations that I've had,\" she said. \"Every time I said I can't do something, there was at least one or two other people that said I could.\"\n\nSo she kept going.\n\nJUST WATCHED \"Black girls run\" organize to fight obesity Replay More Videos ...

They even posted a live video of her finish on Facebook , to celebrate her as the last runner.\n\nA couple of days later, Abdul-Jalil watched the video, which has gotten more than 2,000 views.\n\nWith her depression, Abdul-Jalil sometimes replays sad experiences or picks apart moments in her life -- but after watching the video of her finish, \"that's one external replay or something that has happened in my life where I don't pick it apart,\" she said. \"There's nothing I would change.\"\n\nBefore the race, \"I had given myself a really hard time -- 'Oh, my God, what if I'm the last person?' -- and now it's something that I would do again,\" she said. \"You don't have to fit X mold to be great and to be celebrated. It's validating.\"\n\nBeing the final finisher is something that one runner in London not only would do again, but has done 25 times.\n\n'It's not about the time you do but the time you have'\n\nLisa Jackson loves being the last runner.\n\n\"When you're last, it's a sense of occasion. People really admire you for your grit when getting there,\" she said.\n\nJackson, 51, was \"incredibly unathletic\" as a child and ran her first marathon when she was 31.\n\n\"After the indescribable feeling of accomplishment and joy, I thought, 'I have to experience this feeling every year, at least once,' \" she said, and so she set out to run at least one marathon annually.\n\nLisa Jackson, at the 2013 Verona Marathon in Italy, has run 110 marathons and ultramarathons.\n\n\"When I first started running, my biggest fear was coming last,\" Jackson said. \"And it was actually my 31st marathon -- the South Downs Marathon -- when I was the final finisher for the first time.\"\n\nJackson ran the South Downs trail marathon in the UK in June 2012. The course was hilly, the summer heat was grueling, and she wanted to give up -- but she kept running.\n\nJackson realized that she was the last runner when she saw a man on a bicycle taking down the distance markers along the course, she said. They spoke as she continued on her way, and she made a friend.\n\nNext thing she knew, she was approaching the finish line, where other runners and race organizers gave her a standing ovation.\n\n\"I no longer have any fear of coming last, and if there's a risk of coming second to last, I try to drop back a little to ensure I'm in last place as we cross the line,\" Jackson said.\n\nAfter all, in that moment on the South Downs, she realized that when runners are not stressed about their time, the people they can encounter and the relationships that form can make a race that much more worthwhile.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"My philosophy with running is that it's not about the time you do but the time you have,\" said Jackson, who went on to run the New York, Boston, London, Chicago and Rome marathons, among dozens of others.\n\n\"I think it's really funny when people feel sorry for me for coming in last. ... I think, 'well, how many races have you run?' \" she joked.\n\n\"When you do something that is not easy and you think you're not cut out for and you succeed at it, it gives you so much courage in other aspects of your life,\" she said. \"Running is really the most life-affirming, energizing thing you can do. Don't let the fear of coming last put you off. Every race needs a winner and a loser, and it might as well be you.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Two physicians who lost their young son to the flu last year want parents to listen to their message, born of great grief and suffering: Get your child a flu shot.\n\nDrs. Laura and Anthony Sidari's 4-year-old son, Leon, did not get the flu vaccine last year. He died on Christmas Day, less than 48 hours after he started feeling sick.\n\n\"I didn't know a condition could kill a child that quickly who had been previously healthy,\" said Laura, a psychiatrist. \"This has been a hard haul for us, and we're very private people, but we're trying to help other families.\"\n\nLeon was one of 185 US children who died in the 2017-18 flu season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a historic high.\n\nApproximately 80% of those children had not received a flu shot, according to the CDC.\n\nLaura and Anthony, a rheumatologist, had wanted to get Leon and his 2-year-old brother flu shots at a pharmacy. They lived in Texas, where state law prohibits pharmacists from vaccinating anyone under the age of 7.\n\nThe Sidaris with sons Cameron and Tristan after getting flu shots this fall.\n\nThe couple, busy with their newborn third child, Cameron, decided to get Leon a flu shot when they were going to the pediatrician anyway: when 2-year-old Tristan had his annual visit, scheduled for January 3.\n\nLeon died 10 days before that appointment.\n\n\"It wasn't even on my radar as something that I really, really needed to prioritize,\" Laura said. \"It just slipped through the cracks.\"\n\nThe Sidaris' story is all too familiar to Dr. Flor Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nFor 20 years, Mu\u00f1oz, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, has worked with the American Academy of Pediatrics to increase the rate of flu vaccination for children.\n\nThe rates aren't great: Only 47.8% of children 6 months to 17 years old have had a flu shot in the previous year, according to the CDC , which recommends that everyone over 6 months get a flu shot.\n\nThe problem: Though adults can get flu shots at pharmacies or even at work, children don't have as many options.\n\nLeon Sidari died 10 days before his flu shot appointment.\n\nIn most states, there are limits or outright bans on pharmacists vaccinating children, and flu vaccine clinics at schools are the exception rather than the rule.\n\nOnly 13 states allow pharmacists to vaccinate children of any age, according to the National Association of State Pharmacy Associations.\n\n\"It's frustrating. It seems like we don't learn,\" Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\nThere's no medical reason children shouldn't get flu shots at a pharmacy, said Mu\u00f1oz, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nSome states are changing their laws. New York used to bar pharmacists from giving flu shots to anyone under 18. This year, after the historic flu season, the state changed its laws to permit vaccination for anyone 2 or older.\n\n\"Good for you, New York!\" Mu\u00f1oz said. \"More should be done to make this happen in other states. There should be more of a push.\"\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said more should also be done to make it easier for local health departments to offer flu shot clinics. Right now, he said, it's difficult for those departments to purchase large quantities of vaccine and to bill insurance.\n\n\"We need to do more to make it easy,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Sidaris are doing their part. Last month, they sponsored a \"Say Boo to the Flu\" event in their hometown, Albion, New York, where 59 children were vaccinated.\n\nAlthough the CDC encourages flu vaccines by the end of October each year, it's especially important to get the shot well before the holidays, Mu\u00f1oz said. Flu activity can peak in December, and holiday get-togethers can make the virus spread more quickly. It takes about two weeks for the shot to become effective after you receive it.\n\n\"Leon is my reason this season, and every season, for getting flu shots on time,\" Laura Sidari wrote on her Facebook page. \"Holiday planning and fall festivities can wait, but the flu shot cannot.\"\n\nCNN's John Bonifield and Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this story.",

    "text": "(CNN) John Sarcona was at a baseball game when his mother Joanne found the bloodied T-shirts in his laundry hamper. His bedding was bloody too, and she knew something had gone terribly wrong.\n\n\"I told myself that this can't be happening,\" Joanne said. \"I'm putting two and two together, and I'm trying to get a hold of John. Nobody is answering my calls or texts, and I'm frantic, my mind is running.\"\n\nJohn, now 19, had been diagnosed at age 5 with what would become an extreme case of scoliosis and kyphosis. He'd already had 16 surgeries, with doctors placing metal implants along his spine to support his back as he grew.\n\nWhen the 16-year-old finally came home after his mother noticed the bloody clothes, Joanne took him upstairs and calmly asked, \"John, can you take off your shirt?\"\n\nJohn Sarcona and his mother, Joanne, when he was 6 years old.\n\nWhat she saw still haunts her: metal rods protruding from her son's back. They had broken before, requiring additional surgeries to repair, but this was different. \"They looked like cysts and tumors on John's back,\" she remembers.\n\nWithin a few weeks, John was back in the hospital for his 17th surgery to remove them once and for all, and the recovery was grueling.\n\n\"Every 15 minutes,\" Joanne said, \"the nurses would tell John to take deep breaths. But he'd say to them, 'I can't. I'm in pain. How can I keep my oxygen levels at 99% if I'm dying here?'\"\n\n\"I can't do this anymore,\" John told his mom, ripping off his pulse oximeter. \"I want to go home.\"\n\nA lifetime of struggle\n\nWhen he was 6 years old, John was told to wear a brace for 22 hours a day, taking it off only to shower.\n\nJohn Sarcona as a young boy, before his severe scoliosis developed.\n\nHis mother decorated the brace with stickers and his classmates signed it with their names. But even in elementary school, John felt different. \"I wouldn't want to be around my friends with it on,\" he said. \"It was just so annoying.\"\n\nScoliosis, the curving of the spine from side to side, affects about 2% to 3% percent of the population, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Kyphosis is the bending of the spine forward in the upper back -- leading to a hunchback appearance. Bracing is a common treatment for both conditions in children.\n\nBut for all its inconvenience, the brace did little to help John's worsening spine. He needed surgery, doctors said, and he soon had the operation to insert the rods into his back. Every six months, John returned to the hospital to lengthen them as he grew.\n\nBut after 17 operations, those rods were gone -- and John's condition was as bad as ever.\n\n\"It's important to understand that surgery can do a lot,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Wang, president of the North American Spine Society and co-director of the USC Spine Center. \"But surgery can't do everything. It's not always the fault of the kid or the doctor or the patient if it fails.\"\n\nJohn's surgeon, unable to treat him any further, recommended Dr. Lawrence Lenke, surgeon-in-chief at the Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital at NewYork-Presbyterian and a former president of the Scoliosis Research Society.\n\n\"Part of my practice is taking care of things that other people can't take care of,\" said Lenke. \"Some surgeons, at some point, are not comfortable treating these conditions.\"\n\n'How do I trust you?'\n\nJohn's condition continued to worsen after he returned home from his rod removal. When the family went to NewYork-Presbyterian a month later, Lenke said that John was \"bending by the hour.\"\n\nJoanne was wary of any more procedures. Her son had been under the knife so often that doctors had trouble closing his skin after operations.\n\n\"She was a little terrified of any more surgeries,\" Lenke said, \"because none of them seemed to work. Her direct words were, 'I trusted a surgeon for so long. How do I trust you?'\n\nIndeed, Joanne remembers, \"I didn't trust him at first. And I ask for forgiveness every day for that. But there was no other option, and the surgery had to be done.\"\n\nJohn's kyphosis, an outward curvature of his spine that hunched his back, was so severe that it impacted his breathing, leaving him with only 22% of his lung capacity when he arrived at NewYork-Presbyterian. \"Walking through school, even from one end to the other, I'd be out of breath,\" John remembered. \"It was definitely a struggle.\"\n\nHe needed surgery, but Lenke's proposal was risky -- a slight complication and John could have been paralyzed for life.\n\nCalled a vertebral column resection, Lenke would separate John's spine into different sections, remove two vertebrae at the very center of the severe kyphosis, then straighten the spine as he brought the pieces back together.\n\n\"It does work well,\" Lenke said, \"but the issue is that we have to take the vertebra out around the spinal cord, and that's risky.\" His mother was terrified, but John had few options.\n\n\"The risk of doing nothing was that her son was going to suffocate or die,\" Lenke said, \"and she could see that slowly happening.\"\n\nA moment of terror before 'a new chance at life'\n\nThe surgery was a harrowing one. For 13 hours, Lenke operated on John with a spinal fellow and a scrub nurse as other staff rotated in and out of the operating room. Not everything went according to plan.\n\n\"We test electrical activity,\" Lenke said, \"and in the middle of taking a vertebrate out, the spinal cord activity went away.\"\n\nThat isn't unheard of -- Lenke said it happens in about 30% of surgeries like John's -- but \"for an hour, he was technically paralyzed.\"\n\nLenke powered through the surgery, working quickly to remove pressure from the spinal cord, and John emerged from the operation with no complications.\n\n\"The doctors were soaking wet in their scrubs from top to bottom,\" said Joanne. \"They were completely exhausted. They never stopped working, and they saved my son's life.\"\n\nJohn Sarcona before his surgery, left, and after.

    "text": "Homosassa, Florida (CNN) Kelly Thomas inches across the soft grass, using a walker to navigate her way. Each step is exhilarating and exhausting. She pauses amid the 90-degree Florida heat and smiles.\n\n\"It only takes a little bit of try -- and by a little, I mean a lot,\" she says.\n\nThomas, 24, is one of three paralyzed patients who can now walk again, thanks to a stimulation device implanted in her lower back coupled with intense physical therapy. News of the patients' progress -- considered an important medical advancement -- was published in separate studies in two scientific journals on Monday.\n\nOn a recent sunny day, Thomas returned to the spot that took so much from her on July 19, 2014. It's where the truck she was driving came to a halt after flipping four times around a bend on Halls River Road and smashing into a tree. Her body was motionless, hanging halfway out of the mangled wreckage. She was blue and getting cold.\n\nShe has driven past the scene of the crash many times since then to try to jar her memory. To help remember what happened that night. To piece together the moment that changed everything. Nothing seems to work.\n\nThe scene of the accident that left Kelly Thomas paralyzed.\n\nVisiting this time, she walks toward the tree, talking to her legs to motivate them to keep moving. \"One foot in front of the other,\" she says. \"Slowly but surely.\"\n\nAt 5 feet, 1 inch tall, she is a spitfire of inspiration. Her grit shows immediately, not just from when she walks, but also when she talks.\n\n\"Paralysis isn't in my dictionary.\"\n\n\"Don't call me handicapped, because I'm not.\"\n\n\"Thank God, I was raised cowboy tough.\"\n\nIt takes several minutes for her to walk the 40 feet from her car to the tree. Every step is worth it: Today is about triumph rather than a search for lost memories.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" she says. \"It does feel good to be standing where I thought my life ended.\"\n\nShe woke in a hospital a couple of weeks after the accident, with tubes and wires seemingly hooked up to everything. At 19, she was paralyzed from the chest down.\n\nThomas stands next to the red maple where the truck she was driving came to a halt. \"The stimulator is facilitating my movement,\" she says, \"but my strength is coming from within.\"\n\nShe told her neurosurgeon she would walk again, no matter how slim the odds. He left the room and told her mother not to \"go chasing something that's never going to happen.\"\n\nThe journey has been in no way easy.\n\nThere were tears and screaming fits. In moments of desperation, she would say to God, \"I don't know why this has happened, but if you can help me to understand this, it might make it a little easier.\"\n\nShe had planned to become a physical therapist to help others. Her mission changed that fateful July day. She's now helping others by taking steps and speaking up.\n\nThe trunk of the red maple still bears scars from the crash, with chunks of bark missing from when truck and tree met.\n\nAs she stands next to the tree, Thomas searches for the words to describe her emotions. \"It's somewhere between 'I told you so' and the impossible,\" she says. \"Somewhere between possible and impossible.\n\n\"Being here gives me a sense of power, because I lost a life here. But I also gained a brand new one. And I'm proud of the new life I have.\"\n\nTransforming the spinal cord injury field\n\nThomas is part of innovative research conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center at the University of Louisville.\n\nIn a study published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine, two of four patients with \"motor complete spinal cord injury\" -- meaning no voluntary movement below their injury -- were able to walk again after being implanted with a spinal cord stimulation device and then undergoing extensive physical therapy. They walk with the aid of walkers.\n\nThomas became paralyzed at the age of 19. Always active in life, she made a pledge to herself that she'd walk again, no matter the odds.\n\n\"This should change our thinking about people with paralysis,\" said Susan Harkema, one of the lead researchers on the project and a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. \"It's phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries.\"\n\nClaudia Angeli, the other lead researcher and a senior researcher at the Human Locomotion Research Center at Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville, said it's a fascinating time to be involved in spinal cord research, bringing together decades of investigations culminating in modern-day breakthroughs.\n\n\"It just shows the capacity of the spinal cord and how much we're learning about using the epidural stimulation in combination with therapy,\" Angeli said.\n\n14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents. Over the years , their research has involved14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents.\n\nAll 14 patients have experienced voluntarily movement with the implant, the researchers said. They also showed improvement in bowel and bladder function.\n\nThe latest study focused on four patients, including Thomas who underwent therapy twice a day for five days a week for many months. A morning therapy session would involve working on stepping; an afternoon session would focus on standing. Thomas's therapy lasted 10 months after receiving the implant.\n\nThomas says she has to focus on every step to walk. Sometimes, she talks to her feet to keep them moving.\n\nAll four were able to stand independently, and two were able to walk over ground, the researchers said. One patient fractured his hip, setting his therapy back by several months, the researchers said.\n\nThe other patient who was able to walk over ground had been paralyzed from his neck down with no ability to move his arms until he received the stimulator. \"With the stimulator off,\" Angeli said, \"he can't even sit up.\"\n\nHarkema and Angeli said they believe the positive results were the combination of the stimulation and improved physical therapy treatment.\n\nHarkema underwent a federal investigation a couple years ago. Certain research activities were determined to be in violation of federal regulations, according to a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2016. The letter states the University of Louisville took adequate corrective actions to address the noncompliance. Harkema says she stands by her work.\n\nWhat's it like to see people who are paralyzed walk again?\n\n\"I draw inspiration from every person with a spinal cord injury who comes into this program,\" Harkema said. \"They each have their own unique personalities and spirits. They are just pioneers.\"\n\nAdding to the excitement of these advancements, another study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine unveiled similar results. A man paralyzed since 2013 regained his ability to stand and walk with assistance due to spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy, according to research done in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThomas uses a walker with front wheels. She says her top goal now is ditch the walker one day.\n\n\"What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis,\" Dr. Kendall Lee, the co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic's Neural Engineering Laboratories, said in a press release.\n\nThere have been other cases in recent years in which paralyzed people have risen from their wheelchairs and walked. One study in 2015 and another in 2016 showed success in using rehabilitation combined with what is called \"brain-computer interface,\" in which brain signals were sent to an electrical stimulator or exoskeleton resulting in the generation of muscle activity, allowing some patients to walk.\n\n\"They're different in terms of the way to activate the central nervous system, but the overall outcome is similar,\" said Monica Perez, a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami.\n\nMonday's studies, Perez said, provide important additional evidence to the continued advances being made in the spinal cord injury field. She said it shows more proof that people with severe paralysis often have residual connections that \"can be engaged in a functionally relevant manner -- and that's amazing.\"\n\n\"What the studies demonstrate is that those connections in the central nervous system can still be recruited, even though you have an injury from years ago,\" said Perez, who was not connected to either study.\n\nFrom a scientific point of view, she said, an important consequence of the studies is the awareness \"that we need to work harder to understand how we can better involve those connections,\" she said. \"These people with more severe paralysis are regaining this level of function -- and that is beautiful. We also need more accurate assessments of our patients.\"\n\n\"It's not the first time an individual with severe clinically complete paralysis has walked with assistive technology without the help of a therapist,\" she said. \"But it's tremendously important that in more cases the potential of these approaches can be demonstrated.\"\n\nHarkema and Angeli, whose study was funded in part by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, said it's imperative for stakeholders to come together to fund more research to help as many of the 1.2 million people with paralysis. More than 8,000 have expressed interest in being research participants in their program.\n\nFor Thomas, it's even more personal. She wants others with injuries as severe as hers to experience the transformation she's gone through.\n\n\"Nothing's going to be able to stop me in life, because I took something that was thought to be impossible, and I turned it into possible,\" she says.\n\n'Way too many things to do'\n\nSince she was a child, Thomas has loved to ride horses. She'd saddle up her horse Shadow and take off across the family's ranch. At rodeos, she and Shadow were inseparable.\n\n\"All you need is love and a horse,\" the motto next to her bed says.\n\nIn her late teens, she would run 3 to 4 miles a day, train horses and do endurance weight training at the gym almost every day. She worked as a waitress while attending college to become a physical therapist.\n\nAll of that was shattered in an instant. The young woman who had been so active was now confined to a chair at the age of 19. It was a fate she could not accept.\n\nThomas still rides her horse Shadow, but she needs assistance getting on. Her goal is to be able to saddle Shadow herself and hop on with no help.\n\nNot only had she lost her ability to walk, she'd lost bladder control and sexual function. If she went outside, her body temperature would skyrocket over 101 degrees because it could no longer regulate itself. Every bit of her independence, she felt, had been stripped.\n\n\"I was lying there saying, 'there is no way I can sit in this chair the rest of my life,' \" she says. \"I have way too many things to do.\"\n\nTo walk again, she'd have to \"cowboy up,\" as she puts it. She'd rely on the toughness instilled in her by her father from working on the ranch.\n\nIt would push her to the limits, at times leaving her on the floor crying, wanting to quit. She'd heard about the program in Louisville. She first went for a screening in January 2017. She returned a month later and stayed through May to do physical therapy, working on standing and stepping for an hour every day.\n\nThe stimulator would require a major surgery and a commitment to stay in Louisville for at least a year. She wrestled with the decision. She talked with several men who had the stimulator. They had made gains after the implant, but at the time, no one had walked. She thought, \"what's the point of going through so much work?\"\n\n\"Just being able to stand or wiggle my toes,\" she says, \"was not enough for me.\"\n\nThomas's room is decked out with horse mementos from her days at the rodeo.\n\nOne of her sisters spoke with her. She told Thomas that she didn't want her to wonder \"what if\" for the rest of her life. No one knew what Thomas' decision would be.\n\nOn August 5, 2017, the family's vehicle was loaded up. \"Are we going?\" her father asked.\n\nThey drove the 13 hours to Louisville. The stimulator was implanted the next month.\n\nSensation swept through her body as soon as it was turned on.\"There was this rushing vibration,\" she says. \"It was like a highlighter of my muscles. All of them were contracting. It was wild.\"\n\nThe real work lay in the months ahead. She had endured physical therapy sessions three times a week for three years prior to the implant. That helped set her on a path for success, she says, but it was nothing close to how hard the work over the next year would be. She attended physical therapy fives times a week, a couple of hours every day.\n\nShe clung to her faith during the most agonizing sessions, repeating phrases to herself: \"I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me\" and \"God is with me. I will not fail.\"\n\n\"I tell you what: After the implant, I was introduced to a whole new ballgame,\" she says. \"The hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I prayed my way through so many sessions, just to get me through, because I wanted to quit.\"\n\nThomas says growing up on her family's ranch made her tough and prepared her for the journey.\n\nThe stimulator does not move her legs for her. It stimulates neurons and nerves, allowing her to consciously control the movement.\n\nIt began small -- wiggling of toes -- then one leg being able to move and then figuring out how to sync her legs to be able to walk.\n\nShe was wearing a black T-shirt with the phrase \"No Days Off\" on that magical day in February. She took a step or two, and then her therapist broke out in dance. The two hugged and cried. \"Oh, my God,\" Thomas said.\n\nShe wiped away the tears and took more steps.\n\nIt was like trying to pat your tummy and rub your head at the same time, she says explaining how it felt trying to coordinate her legs, body and mind.\n\n\"Trying to trust my body, trying to find a cadence, was very hard.\"\n\nFinding her calling\n\nThomas can now walk and talk at the same time, but she still must focus on each step.\n\nShe presses a device against her abdomen to turn the stimulator on. \"I'm still paralyzed as can be without it,\" she says.\n\nTo turn her stimulator on, Kelly uses a magnet hooked up to this device and presses it against her abdomen.\n\nWhen she stands, she asks herself, \"How do I walk, again?\"\n\nBeyond helping her walk, the stimulator has restored sexual function and much of her bladder control. She has regained muscle mass, and nerve pain in her right foot has disappeared. \"I'm totally pro stimulator. I love it,\" she says.\n\nStrolling across her front lawn at the family ranch, she says that her No. 1 goal in the short term is to get rid of her walker. She'd love to be able to run again.\n\nShe points to the nearby barn that houses Shadow. She longs to be able to walk to the barn by herself, saddle her up and get on. She'd longs to get Shadow in a full gallop again.\n\n\"That's the day I'll accept that I'm healed,\" she says.\n\nFor now, she's taking every day one stride at a time. She says her story is not about herself; it's about helping others. She's buoyed by messages of support from friends and strangers alike. She says it's for them that she works so hard.\n\nIn town, that encouragement is on full display.\n\n\"I just want to tell you congratulations, sweetie. You're doing beautiful,\" a woman tells her outside the Homosassa Public Library.\n\nA man in a pickup sees her struggling at her car. \"Need some help?\" he asks.\n\n\"No, sir,\" she responds. \"I've got it.\"\n\nThomas stands at the spot where she was left paralyzed in 2014. She said it was empowering to be able to walk and stand at the scene.\n\nShe exemplifies a fierce determination like few others. Through her struggle, she's found her calling. Being around her, one can't help but be inspired. She rattles off an array of powerful messages.\n\n\"Even if I can't physically help people like I initially intended to do, I can dang sure encourage, help and motivate.\"\n\n\"I carry on with my life like nobody's business, even if my legs aren't working so great.\"\n\n\"The stimulator is facilitating my movement, but my strength is coming from within.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat strength is what's gotten her this far. Her 19-year-old brother, Sam, sums it up in cowboy speak: \"There's nothing she can't do. That's for sure.\"\n\nHe lifts his sister onto Shadow. Kelly and Shadow trot around the front yard. She doesn't know when, but she says one day, she'll hop on without her brother's help.\n\n\"I don't have a time frame,\" she says, \"but I have physical goals to get me there.\"\n\nThe moral of her story, she says, is never underestimate a cowboy.",

    "text": "(CNN) For Capt. Mark Wollmershauser Jr. and the Tulsa Police Department, the late-2000s and early 2010s were an extremely dangerous time.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a state that is no stranger to the scourge of methamphetamine addiction, those years were the heyday of the \"shake and bake\" method -- a rudimentary way of making meth using just cold medicine, some toxic chemicals and an empty two-liter bottle.\n\nThe technique is simple enough that many addicts can cook their own meth, but with one tiny misstep, the chemical reaction that occurs inside can cause deadly explosions\n\nBy 2011, Wollmershauser and his narcotics unit were finding and dismantling hundreds of these vessels in meth labs around the city.\n\nA display of items used in the \"shake-and-bake\" method of manufacturing methamphetamine is shown in Oklahoma City. The items shown were purchased for display purposes.\n\n\"People were not just burning themselves while cooking meth but were causing damage to other residents that had nothing to do with methamphetamine,\" he said. \"It was a really horrible time.\"\n\nWhen new laws were enacted to limit access to pseudoephedrine -- an allergy drug used in making meth -- the proliferation of these mobile labs waned. After responding to a high of 431 meth labs in 2011, his department encountered just 19 last year.\n\nBut Wollmershauser said that didn't spell the end of Tulsa's meth problem. In fact, officials across the state say they are seizing meth that is purer, cheaper and in greater quantities than ever before, with most of it coming from south of the border.\n\nAnd while much of America is focused on combating the devastating impacts of opioid addiction, some states like Oklahoma are struggling to fight a new battle against an old foe.\n\nThe role of Mexican 'superlabs'\n\nRichard Salter has been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 27 years, most recently as the special agent in charge for the state of Oklahoma.\n\nHe said the meth problem in Oklahoma is getting worse, and points to Mexican cartels -- in particular, the powerful Sinaloa cartel -- as the reason.\n\nAs it became more difficult and dangerous to produce meth in the United States, cartels recognized an opportunity to fill the void.\n\n\"They came in with much purer, much cheaper meth and just flooded this region of the country,\" Salter said.\n\nA Mexican Army expert stands near containers with crystal meth paste at a clandestine laboratory in Mexico's Baja California state. \"Superlabs\" like this one can produce hundreds of pounds of crystal meth daily.\n\nSalter said in 2012, the DEA was buying meth undercover off the streets for $1,100 an ounce. Today, his agents are regularly getting ounces for just $250 to $450.\n\n\"That's as cheap as I have ever seen methamphetamine my entire career,\" he said.\n\nThe reason for the drop in prices is the scale of production that the Mexican cartels have achieved. Whereas \"shake and bake\" labs could turn out lots of small batches, so-called \"superlabs\" in Mexico produce hundreds of pounds daily.\n\nSalter said most of the meth his agents seize first comes across the US-Mexico border in California or Arizona, before making its way through the interstate highway system and temporary stash houses on its way to Oklahoma.\n\nAlong the border, officials with US Customs and Border Protection also report a steep increase in the amount of meth they are seizing.\n\nAnne Maricich, deputy director of field operations for the agency's San Diego ports of entry, said her field office has seen a 50% increase in the amount of meth seized compared to this time last year.\n\n\"The other hard narcotics like cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, we see them -- they're prevalent at our border crossings, but nowhere near the quantities that we see of meth,\" she said.\n\nOn the streets of Oklahoma, this influx of cheap and powerful meth has had deadly consequences.\n\nThe number of lethal meth overdoses in the state has more than doubled in recent years, rising from 140 in 2012 to 335 deaths in 2016. In 2017, there were 327 meth overdose deaths, but that tally is incomplete and the actual number is likely higher, according to Mark Woodward, spokesman with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics.\n\n\"There's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma, but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis,\" said Woodward. \"But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine.\"\n\nPerhaps no city has been hit harder by this latest meth epidemic than Tulsa.\n\nIn just the first six months of 2018, Wollmershauser said his Special Investigations Division has already surpassed the amount of meth they seized in all of 2017 by 30 pounds.\n\nHe can't explain why the problem is more severe here than in other parts of the state, but he doesn't think incarceration is the solution.\n\nThere's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma, but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis. But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine.\n\nWollmershauser said his department is trying to use more \"front end diversion\" tactics to help addicts get treatment without getting the criminal justice system involved, while also aggressively pursuing the cartels and other large-scale distributors.\n\nWhile the amount of meth his officers has seized has risen, he said his department is on track to reduce the number of arrests by 40% this year.\n\n\"I think we're definitely targeting the right folks that are taking advantage of our city and citizens, but the addiction is strong and it's difficult,\" Wollmershauser said.\n\nHow meth fueled a crisis behind bars\n\nLindsay McAteer's struggles with anxiety and depression led her to self-medicate as a teenager.\n\nAt age 14, her boyfriend at the time introduced her to meth.\n\n\"I immediately liked it,\" McAteer said. \"It gave me a false sense of identity and a false sense of accomplishment.\"\n\nIt was the beginning of a 20-year struggle with the drug that nearly ended with a life sentence.\n\nI was losing everything, and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK, despite the fact that nothing was OK.\n\nAfter using meth for several years, she said she stopped for a brief period, but after she was laid off from work and had her house foreclosed on, her addiction spiraled out of control.\n\n\"I had nothing,\" McAteer said. \"I was losing everything, and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK, despite the fact that nothing was OK.\"\n\nIn addition to using meth, McAteer began selling the drug. She was eventually arrested for trafficking and found herself staring at a possible sentence of 12 years to life.\n\nJUST WATCHED The total chaos of meth addiction Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The total chaos of meth addiction 00:56\n\nBut even for those like McAteer who face time in prison, there are sometimes alternatives to a life behind bars. Women in Recovery , or WIR, is an intensive program for women who are looking at lengthy sentences for drug offenses in Tulsa County.\n\nWith the door of a prison cell the only other option that was open to her, McAteer entered WIR in August 2014.\n\nMimi Tarrasch, the executive senior director for WIR, said that many of the program's participants are multi-substance users, but at least 60% have seen their addictions lead them to meth.\n\n\"Early on, because it's a stimulant, they feel wonderful and it makes them productive and motivated,\" said Roxanne Hinther, clinical director for WIR. \"But ultimately, they can't take care of their children and they lose everything they have.\"\n\nI can say that recovery is definitely possible, and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment.\n\nTarrasch said that most of the women in her program have been battling addiction for 13 to 15 years, which takes a huge toll on their health and wellness, and that of their family. Many have also experienced traumatic events, from childhood abuse to sexual assaults and domestic violence.\n\nUsing a range of treatments, training and education, the program gives women who would be spending time behind bars a second chance at a productive and fulfilling life.\n\nMcAteer graduated from WIR in 2016 and has now been in active recovery for more than four years. Today, she works as a housing compliance specialist for the Mental Health Association Oklahoma.\n\nSince Women in Recovery began in 2009, 390 women have graduated, with 6.7% of graduates relapsing or falling back into criminal activity.\n\n\"I can say that recovery is definitely possible, and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment,\" McAteer said. \"It's not foolproof -- I can't say that everyone is able to use this [program] the way it's designed to work, but the vast majority of us do.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Her Catholic boyfriend said he was waiting until marriage to have sex, so she felt safe. But after she passed out fully clothed on prom night, she woke up naked with him on top of and inside her. She got pregnant that night, 36 years ago, and he paid for her abortion. Then he mailed a letter to tell her she was going to hell.\n\nFive drunken frat boys piled on top of a college sophomore, who was sober, as the party's loud music drowned out her screams in the dark room. They grabbed at and groped her. One of them penetrated her with his finger before she broke free and ran.\n\nA 19-year-old studying abroad woke up to a young man fondling her and masturbating in her face. An older boy plied a 15-year-old with booze and, after she passed out at a house party, stole her virginity. Another young woman took the cocktail a cute guy offered on her 21st birthday. She didn't know what to call it when the same guy had his way with her after she grew woozy, they left the bar and her body went numb. More than a decade later, when a friend of friends assaulted her, dislocated her jaw and left her bruised, she knew the word: rape.\n\nThese are just a sampling of the dozens of stories of sexual assault that were shared with me in recent days by phone, email and through social media. They are accounts from women in their 30s, 40s and 50s who I asked to reflect on their younger years, mostly in high school and college. They spoke out on the condition that they, and the accused, would remain anonymous.\n\nSome called their sexual assaults a \"clich\u00e9,\" perhaps too common to be worth mentioning. One woman simply quipped, \"Is there a woman who made it through college without this experience?\"\n\nWith decades-old allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by Judge Brett Kavanaugh making headlines and threatening to derail his Supreme Court nomination, we've entered a new chapter in the #MeToo movement. Women are thinking back to their own experiences, many of them for the first time in years. They're talking about their assaults online, in their homes and at dinner parties.\n\nWhat are these stories stirring up in women? Are they putting themselves in the shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers? And do they think they could or would come forward themselves if the men who assaulted them were suddenly poised for positions of power?\n\n'Every scream I never screamed'\n\nPlenty of those I heard from spent years blaming themselves and few, if they knew who their attackers were, reported anything to authorities or other adults, including parents. Those who did learned quickly why most girls and women don't . They weren't believed, felt ashamed and didn't see justice served. They were fed the \"boys will be boys\" line, even by their mothers.\n\nSome had never shared their stories before; others only with select family members or friends.\n\nThere were those who were relatively unscathed by their experiences. Others were not so fortunate and have years of therapy behind them to prove it. One woman said she dropped out of college for a year and couldn't have an intimate relationship for eight years after her rape. The one who lost her virginity against her will at 15 listed off a series of subsequent assaults and spent much of her adult life struggling with low self-esteem and trying not to \"feel like a slut.\"\n\nThe last time she was assaulted, she was nearly 40. She was walking through a park in broad daylight when a man approached from behind, thrust his hand up her skirt and grabbed her crotch.\n\n\"At first I froze, but then I started to scream,\" she said. \"I couldn't stop screaming. ... It was every scream I never screamed.\"\n\nThey were assaulted by men or boys they didn't know, and ones they were fixed up with, knew since childhood or were dating. One woman's attacker was a longtime crush; a second's a best friend. A third woman's attacker was a graduate student she looked up to as an undergrad; he was the \"golden boy\" in the academic department who could make or break her professional future. A fourth's supervised summer legislative interns on Capitol Hill.\n\nA fifth woman revealed she was assaulted by three men -- relatives or people connected to family members.\n\n\"Until their parents die, until they move away and I never have to see their face again, until I die -- most will never know that these people who walk among us have this fundamentally broken way of treating women,\" she wrote in a social media post.\n\nTo come forward about these men before then wouldn't be \"worth the headache,\" she said. But, \"if any of these people got anywhere near one of the highest offices in the land, I'd air their dirty laundry. ... Bless this woman (referring to Christine Blasey Ford) as she walks through this fire. I'm frankly relieved that I likely won't ever be in her shoes.\"\n\n'Bookend to Brock Turner'\n\nFor some, this moment has been triggering. One woman called it a \"bookend to Brock Turner,\" a story that hit a number of the women I heard from harder than this. Turner is the former Stanford University student who, in January 2015, was caught on campus, outside a fraternity, sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. He was sentenced to six months in jail but only served three.\n\nOne woman said the election of President Donald Trump was what did her in. She couldn't stop crying and was inconsolable the day after he won.\n\n\"I felt like my country had just said that a man who was known to be a serial sexual assaulter was worthy to hold the highest office, which meant that it was okay to assault women,\" she wrote.\n\nThe growing activism of women give many of them hope, even if they fear that what they want to see will take time.\n\n\"The ground beneath these men has shifted in ways that they are still not prepared for,\" one woman said.\n\nThey want to think, though, that high schoolers and college students are more sensitive and aware, better equipped to call sexual assault what it is and more inclined to speak up. They're afraid they may not be right.\n\nIf they could talk to their younger selves, they'd take them by the shoulders and tell them they didn't deserve the wrongs pushed on them.\n\nTheir own parents didn't talk to them in ways they talk to their own children. Their little ones, sons and daughters, learn about consent early and aren't required to hug or touch anyone they don't want to hug or touch. They're given lessons in boundaries and understand they have agency over their own bodies.\n\nSome have told their older kids what happened to them, while others say the details are something they'll never share. They don't shy away from using words such as rape and assault. They talk openly about relationships and how to honor partners. They insist their sons treat girls and women -- really, everyone -- with respect and tell their daughters to be vigilant.\n\nOne woman is waiting for the day when her kids will let her sign them up for self-defense classes.\n\n'A skeleton' in his closet\n\nThey question if they'd come forward like Kavanaugh's accusers.\n\nThere are those who can't fathom putting their own lives under the microscope or exposing their families to the fallout. Some look back and, even after all these years, worry that they were partially to blame. One said she'd want to dig into her attacker's more recent past, see if he's shown respect for women and allow for the chance that he'd changed. Others want to believe that if the greater good depended on it, they'd be as brave.\n\n\"The more 'the public' sees that this happened to countless women who did not report it, the harder it will be to deny the accusations of those who do come forward,\" one woman wrote in an email. \"We can't all be liars.\"\n\nA few women mentioned that they've Googled the men who assaulted them. They've monitored their lives and careers. One woman decided, timed with the 30th anniversary of her assault, to send the now-family man a letter. She never expected to hear from him -- and she didn't. She did it for herself. By putting words to what she's lived with all these years, she felt better.\n\nAt one point the prom date who once vowed he was waiting until marriage to have sex, and then paid for an abortion after he raped his date, held a job in a state attorney's office.\n\n\"I remember back then wondering what I would do if I learned he was running for public office. It seemed plausible that he would,\" the woman said. \"I wondered if he considered me and my abortion a skeleton in his Republican closet.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nJust days after she first typed #MeToo on her Facebook page last year, even though they had no friends in common, he sent her a Facebook friend request. It was the first contact he'd made with her since he'd written 35 years earlier to tell her she was going to hell.\n\nIt felt a bit like \"a litmus test,\" she said. Would her accepting, in his mind, mean he was safe?\n\nShe waited a few days and then accepted.\n\nShe did it not because she was letting him off the hook. She accepted because she wanted him to see her every post, to know how strong she is.",

    "text": "Augusta, Georgia (CNN) There's nothing sweet or adorable about the way newlyweds Brittany and Ryan Coleman first met -- no \"meet cute\" like in rom-com movies or romance novels.\n\nIt was 2015, and Brittany bought heroin from Ryan in a parking lot, and Ryan cheated her. Brittany called him some choice names, and Ryan shrugged his shoulders and walked off.\n\nDespite that inauspicious beginning, and the many years of drug abuse that preceded it, the Colemans want to get out this message: There is life and love after drug addiction.\n\nThey want to give hope to those whose lives have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic , which kills more than 115 people every day in the United States.\n\n\"You just have to find the right people to get connected to to kind of show you the way out,\" said Brittany, 29.\n\nAddiction, rehab and relapse\n\nWhen Brittany Hokrein was 11 years old, her parents divorced, and she and her brothers and mother moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania.\n\nShe struggled emotionally, and at age 14 she started to use marijuana and alcohol so she wouldn't feel the hurt. Soon, pain pills became her drug of choice, and by age 18 she was addicted.\n\nRyan, now 37, was born into a military family, moving from Georgia to Germany to Texas and then back to Georgia. Like Brittany, he had a loving family, but as a teenager, he felt like he didn't fit in, and he started to smoke pot at age 14.\n\n\"I found that I could medicate that feeling. Life was great once I got high,\" he said.\n\nBy the time Ryan was 17, he was smoking pot every day, and he dropped out of high school senior year. He moved on to LSD and cocaine. By the time he was 20 he was hooked on painkillers.\n\nHis father, an Army drill sergeant, and his mother, a high school teacher, begged him to go to recovery. They told him a recovery program had saved his mother from alcoholism when Ryan was a child. But he rebelled and rejected everything his parents stood for.\n\nBy 22, he was strung out on heroin. \"I had to have it,\" he said.\n\nOver the next 10 years, Brittany and Ryan unknowingly led parallel lives. Hopping from city to city, they both used heroin, methamphetamines, prescription opioids, Xanax, cocaine and alcohol.\n\nBrittany overdosed three times, and Ryan overdosed five times. Ryan got arrested 16 times, mostly for stealing so he could get money to buy drugs. Brittany stole, too, and had a stint at prostitution.\n\nTheir parents loved them and helped get them into rehab programs. Each stint ended in a relapse.\n\nBy 2016, both Ryan and Brittany had moved back to Augusta, Georgia.\n\nThey happened to end up at the same recovery group meeting. Eight months had passed since they'd met at that drug deal in the parking lot.\n\nA forbidden love (and with good reason)\n\nHe's cute, Brittany thought when she met him again at rehab.\n\nShe's beautiful, Ryan thought. Really beautiful. And she looked so familiar.\n\nHe realized she was the woman he'd cheated in the drug deal.\n\n\"I thought, 'This was fate.' I walked right up to her and told her I needed to apologize for ripping her off,\" Ryan remembered. \"I did want to make amends, but I also had an ulterior moment. I wanted to date her.\"\n\nDating was discouraged in their recovery program -- and Brittany and Ryan found out why.\n\nAs they fell in love, they spent all their time together and their lives became intertwined. At first they both stayed sober but then slowly, imperceptibly, Ryan slipped away, taking Brittany with him.\n\nAfter about four months of dating, one Friday morning Ryan told Brittany he was going down to a park by the Savannah River to think about his life.\n\nBut instead, he drove two hours to Atlanta to buy heroin and cocaine.\n\nHe called her on the way and told her the truth. Brittany stood there with her phone in her hand. She wrote out a text that she knew she shouldn't send.\n\nIt said that Ryan needed to bring back some drugs for her. She stared at the text for a while. Then she hit send.\n\nAnd everything fell apart.\n\nGiving up heroin -- and each other\n\nFor the next week, Brittany and Ryan went right back to heroin, right back to cocaine, right back to meth, sometimes all at the same time.\n\n\"I even romanticized it, saying f*** all the rules, we're going to be heroin junkies together, all that 'Trainspotting' bull****,\" he said, referring to the 1996 film about young Britons on heroin. \"Addicts have a sick way of romanticizing their drug use.\"\n\nThen on October 3, 2016, they both overdosed on meth and heroin. Medics found Brittany lying on the floor of a gas station bathroom, and Ryan right outside, unconscious in his car.\n\nThe medics gave them doses of Narcan, the drug that reverses overdoses. Brittany had done so much heroin she needed two doses.\n\nRyan was wracked with guilt. He felt personally responsible for Brittany's near death in that gas station bathroom. He was the one who'd driven to Atlanta to get drugs when they were both working so hard to be clean. He was the one who said 'yes' when she asked him to bring some back for her.\n\n\"I had almost killed the person I loved the most,\" he said.\n\nBrittany returned to Hope House, a treatment center for women in Augusta.\n\nRyan visited here there. Surrounded by his sponsor from his recovery group and Brittany's counselors, he got down on his knees -- and apologized.\n\n\"He held my hand and apologized to me in front of all those people,\" Brittany said, crying at the memory of it. \"He was shaking and I was shaking. He said how sorry he was for putting me through all this and how scared he was to almost lose me.\"\n\nThey then had to do something they describe as just as hard as giving up heroin: They had to give each other up. For a month, they had no contact at all.\n\n\"The only way for us to survive was to focus only on our recovery, and not on each other,\" Brittany said. \"It was the only way it would work.\"\n\nBrittany then left Hope House, and the two met up at their recovery group's Thanksgiving dinner. They started back dating slowly, and then a year and a half later, on February 24, 2018, they were married.\n\nBrittany and Ryan Coleman on their wedding day in February.\n\nTwo years sober\n\nNext month marks two years of sobriety for both Brittany and Ryan, and today they live in a small house with four cats in Augusta. Ryan works at a vape store, where he's advanced from part-time clerk to assistant manager to manager. Brittany works at a rehab center, helping others overcome their addictions.\n\nThey volunteer to help others in recovery and have also spoken at programs that train people how to use Narcan, the drug that saved both of them so many times.\n\nWhen asked how they survived addiction where so many have died, they say it was the grace of God and to a large degree luck -- luck that those Narcan doses were available right when they needed them.\n\nThey also say they let other people guide them: their families, who never gave up on them; the rehab counselors who stuck with them; and their recovery mentors who showed them the way, including that they needed to focus on their individual recoveries and not on each other in order to survive.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAll of those people joined them on their wedding day.\n\n\"It was really a culmination of all the good things going on in our lives finally really coming together,\" Ryan said.\n\nSometimes Brittany can't believe she's alive, much less in a loving, stable relationship.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. I don't think that I would have ever imagined that I would be married and happy and just planning a future with another human,\" she said. \"I didn't ever picture that for myself.\"\n\nThey want people in the throes of addiction to see that despite the dire statistics, there can be hope.\n\n\"I want them to see people like us and realize that we were in that same place at one point in our lives -- and we got out,\" Ryan said.",

    "text": "No matter the obstacles placed in front of her, of which there were many, she refused to be pitied and was determined to live a life that mattered. She inspired countless people, invited -- no, demanded -- honest talk about illness and mortality, and brightened the worlds of those she touched with her smile, spunk and spirit.\n\nOn Sunday evening, after being taken off life support and using the newly transplanted lungs she received just one week earlier, Claire took her last breath. The cause of death was a massive stroke she suffered soon after the transplant surgery. She was 21.\n\n'Love what is'\n\nA quarter of Claire's life was spent in the hospital. The medical team that tended to her became family. She played hide-and-seek with nurses and left explosions of glitter in her wake. She watched one of her doctors squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk. She took great care to decorate her hospital room so it felt and looked like home.\n\nHer parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split up when Claire was 3, but they remained friends and partners in her care.\n\nHer father credits Claire with teaching him \"to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet\" and to learn to \"love what is.\"\n\nYeager, who lost and quit jobs as hospital stays dictated, always marveled at her daughter's aura and her ability to lift up those around her.\n\nIn 2017, Yeager recalled a conversation with Claire about death. At one point, Claire looked at her mom and said, \"After you die, you're closer to everyone you love because you're part of everything,\" Yeager remembered.\n\nThese words were a gift, a reminder that Claire would remain with her always, even after she was gone.\n\nTrusting Claire\n\nMore than 30,000 people in the United States, more than 70,000 worldwide, have cystic fibrosis, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The median survival age is 40, the foundation reports, which is a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.\n\nClaire Wineland spent a quarter of her life in the hospital.\n\nThe genetic and progressive disease creates an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs. It also complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.\n\nThere is no cure, but dutiful breathing treatments -- which eat up hours each day -- can help with symptoms and complications. A double-lung transplant, when successful, can add years to a patient's life.\n\nClaire's parents learned to trust their independent and strong-willed daughter. When it came to her care, she knew her body best -- what worked for her, what didn't and how far she was willing to go.\n\nSo when she became a legal adult and told them she had no intention of getting a double-lung transplant, they had to accept her decision, even if it pained them.\n\n\"I had to be honest,\" she once explained. \"It's not for me and never has been.\"\n\nA change of heart\n\nClaire took the gift of life and her health seriously, but she didn't take herself too seriously. She once escaped from the hospital so she could attend a Bernie Sanders rally. She laughed at the absurdities that often swirled around her, including those moments in the produce aisle at Whole Foods when shoppers would prescribe her unsolicited \"cures,\" telling her to eat more pineapple or that a mushroom cleanse would take care of everything.\n\nClaire Wineland's greatest wish, her mother said, was that \"her foundation will live on, even in her absence.\"\n\nShe was of the mind that she would leave this world with the body she came in with. She'd travel, answer calls for speaking engagements and put energy into her foundation , which she set up at age 13 after coming out of a 16-day medically induced coma. She'd work on a book -- promising it wouldn't be \"another happy sick person book\" -- and appreciate the small things like swims in the ocean for as long as she was able.\n\nAt a TEDx talk she gave last year, Claire made a point of saying how cystic fibrosis helped give her a quality of life.\n\n\"Life isn't just about being happy. ... It's not about how you feel second to second,\" she said. \"It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given.\"\n\nClaire had a change of heart about transplant earlier this year, prompted by a steep decline in her health that robbed her of the energy and ability to do what gave her joy and purpose. She wasn't done contributing. It was a welcome, albeit terrifying, development for those who loved her.\n\nTo get on the list for new lungs, she had to be sick enough to need them, yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery. Some people worried that she'd waited too long and wouldn't be given the chance at continued life.\n\nBut Claire took on the evaluation process to get on the list with laser focus. She sat in an educational meeting at UC San Diego Health's transplant center and diligently took notes.\n\nRevealed on her left ankle was a tattoo: the thumbs-up \"Don't Panic\" logo from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\"\n\nShe listened to the risks and the long list of side effects and emerged unfazed.\n\n\"None of it spooked me,\" Claire said afterward. \"Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do ... I'm willing to deal with anything.\"\n\n'It's a GO!!!'\n\nIn late May, she made the list and shared the exciting news with her social media followers who dot the globe. But then, a mix of health and life complications took a toll and knocked her off the list, temporarily. By mid-August, she was back on and feeling ready.\n\nClaire and her mother beamed in a photo posted on social media after they learned her transplant was a go.\n\nShe'd worked hard to get there, was focused on her self-care and getting stronger. She joked that the squats she was doing, upon doctor's orders, would help get her more than lungs. She'd also get a butt.\n\nShe knew that the call could come at any minute, and on August 26, it did.\n\n\"It's a GO!!!\" she posted on Twitter, not long before she was wheeled into the operating room in San Diego. \"See y'all on [the] other side.\"\n\nThe nine-hour surgery went well, and her mother reported that the lungs were working great. Yeager posted a video of herself doing a happy dance with friends in the waiting room.\n\nBut not long after the successful surgery, hope turned to fear. Claire suffered a stroke when a blood clot cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain. She never emerged from her medically induced coma. Despite emergency surgeries, and what her mother described as \"Herculean efforts\" to try to save her, the daughter she knew was gone. Given the severity of the stroke and Claire's advance directive, it became clear that it was time to let her go. She passed away peacefully, with her parents by her side.\n\n\"They saw her into this world for her first breath and were with her for her last,\" Laura McHolm, the board chair for Claire's foundation, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nLess than 3% of lung transplant recipients have a stroke between the surgery and hospital discharge, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which operates the nation's organ transplant system.\n\nClaire, who understood the importance of organ donation, was a donor herself. On Monday afternoon, her mother received word that Claire had already made a difference.\n\n\"Claire was able to save the life of two people, her right kidney was transplanted to a 44 year old woman in San Diego, and her left kidney was transplanted to a 55 year old male in Northern California. Also, Claire's corneas and tissue was recovered and she will be able to enhance the life of up to 50 people,\" a family services specialist wrote to Yeager in an email message. \"Claire's gift is huge, I want your family to know that your daughter is a hero.\"\n\nThe family intends to honor her memory by continuing to advance Claire's Place Foundation , which she established to financially support others affected by her lifelong disease.\n\n'Go enjoy it'\n\nIn one of the last videos Claire posted, she went where she hadn't before.\n\nA self-described \"goofball,\" she usually engaged people with humor and optimism. This time, she was raw and allowed herself to cry. As she faced the prospect of getting a double-lung transplant, she understood how desperate she was to live -- and give -- more.\n\n\"It hurts everything inside of me to make this video,\" she said into the camera. \"I didn't realize how much I didn't expect to live this long. I didn't expect to have a chance. ... The years of telling myself I can do it on my own are over.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe had plenty of emotional support, but she worried what transplant surgery might mean for her future and her parents' future if it didn't go well. What if they poured everything into her transplant, and she didn't make it or was not able to work again, she explained later. She needed financial help. By asking for it, she said, she could relax and get in the headspace for whatever would come next.\n\nBefore signing off, Claire implored viewers to do one thing.\n\n\"Go enjoy your life. Really. I mean that seriously,\" she said with her signature smile and laugh, her eyes not yet dry. \"Go enjoy it, 'cause there are people fighting like hell for it.\"",

    "text": "Nyack, New York (CNN) Cara Pressman raises her hands in triumph. The crowd claps in unison, and a DJ cranks up the music. The banquet hall on the banks of the Hudson pulsates as nine of Cara's best friends lead a procession to the dance floor.\n\nIt's the start of her Sweet 16 birthday party -- a celebration not just of her big day but of all that has happened in the past year. A way for friends and family to express their love.\n\nCara became a viral sensation months ago after the teen with a seizure disorder delivered a blunt message to her insurer. Her two words for Aetna -- \"screw you\" -- expressed the anger she felt at being denied a minimally invasive brain surgery that promised to end her seizures.\n\nHer story, first told by CNN in December , triggered a massive uproar, and Aetna eventually approved the procedure.\n\nThis Saturday evening, amid the cheers of her closest friends, Cara radiates on stage beneath strings of white flashing lights. Then someone shouts, and the dance floor clears. Everyone rushes outside.\n\nIt's as if Mother Nature has joined the party: A rainbow stretches from the Hudson River high into the heavens.\n\nCara launches her head back and strikes an array of poses as people take photos.\n\n\"That's what's important in life -- miracles, right?\" her mother, Julie Pressman, says, pointing to the sky. \"I can finally exhale.\"\n\nHer father, Rob, says it's \"like a unicorn coming down.\"\n\n\"She's been so happy since the operation,\" he says. \"We're looking forward to a great year.\"\n\nIt's a moment the family thought might never come.\n\nAfter Cara speaks, Aetna changes policy\n\nCara's mother became a fierce champion for her youngest daughter, determined that Cara would get the surgery her doctors believed could stop her seizures.\n\nA motivational note rests on the family refrigerator. Cara has suffered from a seizure disorder most of her life.\n\nEach time they struck, her body would grow cold and shake. She'd zone out anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes, typically still aware of what was going on around her. She had seizures on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays, in the classroom. Most anywhere.\n\nHer doctors last year recommended Cara for laser ablation surgery, a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures originate.\n\nIt's cutting-edge work, performed through an eighth-inch hole in the skull. Neurosurgeons believe it to be more precise and less invasive than traditional open brain surgery, in which a two-inch hole is cut in the skull or, in some cases, the entire skull cap is removed.\n\nYet the nation's third-largest insurance company overruled her treating physicians. In denying her coverage, Aetna said it considered laser ablation surgery \"experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established.\"\n\n\"Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures [sic] effective for treatment of the member's condition,\" Aetna said.\n\nWhen first approached for comment by CNN late last year, the insurance giant stood by its denial.\n\nCara underwent the laser ablation surgery on July 25. Three weeks later, she says she's adjusting well: \"It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream, but I also know it's real.\"\n\nIn response, Cara had this message : \"Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain, I would probably just say, 'screw you.' \"\n\nFrom there, the story took off. The hashtags #ScrewAetna and #CaraPressman were shared across Twitter. Her grandmother made T-shirts for family members for Christmas that read \"I'm on Cara's team\" on the front; on the back, the message said #SYA (short for #ScrewYouAetna ).\n\nGirl has blunt message for Aetna after her brain surgery request was deniedhttps://t.co/QMmPf2i4t0 \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) December 11, 2017\n\nBehind the scenes, neurologists and neurosurgeons reached out to the family, offering support. But none was more powerful than Mark Solazzo, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Northwell Health , New York's largest health care provider.\n\nThe hospital executive was so moved by Cara's story he told the family: \"This is the last day you're going to fight Aetna on your own.\"\n\nSolazzo is passionate on this issue: Insurance denials for what Northwell deems medically necessary procedures have swelled the past two years, with the health provider saying it lost $150 million in justifiable reimbursements at a time when insurance companies have been setting record profits.\n\nThe Northwell executive set in motion a chain of events. He tapped Dr. Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, the director of Northwell's epilepsy surgery, to handle Cara's case and even offered the surgery for free if Aetna still refused to cover it.\n\n\"I was happy to do that,\" Mehta said.\n\nBefore her Sweet 16 party, Cara spent the day getting her hair and makeup done.\n\nCara underwent a series of tests this spring with her new team at Northwell. Mehta said her case was complex because the focal point of her seizures was fairly deep in her brain behind her temple. To perform an open brain surgery, he said, he would need to dissect a portion of her brain to get to the spot.\n\nAs a result, Mehta said, her team agreed with her previous doctors that laser ablation was the route to go.\n\n\"We did our due diligence, and we did determine that this would be the best way to treat her epilepsy,\" he told CNN.\n\nAlong the way, Aetna had a change of heart. In April, the insurer notified the family it would cover the surgery: \"Coverage for this service has been approved, subject to the requirements in this letter.\"\n\nThere was no explanation. No apology. Just an approval with full coverage.\n\nPressed by CNN for answers, Aetna said the approval came after her doctors made a new request for laser ablation surgery. \"Based on recently published clinical evidence, the procedure was approved.\"\n\nAetna went on to say it recently updated its policies for epilepsy patients seeking laser ablation. \"Related, in July 2018 we made updates to our epilepsy surgery clinical policies based on recently-published data,\" Aetna said. \"The new guidelines cover laser ablation surgery if certain criteria are met.\n\n\"As shared in December, we constantly evaluate new published and peer-reviewed studies as well as additional evidence when developing our clinical policies, and will continue to do so.\"\n\nCara's mother, Julie, wanted the party to be especially memorable: \"It's not just a birthday party. It's literally like a debut. She's coming out of this brain surgery and is so radically different.\"\n\nMehta gave all the credit to the diminutive teen with the powerful voice: \"She really advocated for herself, and it worked out for her. Whatever happened, it got her the appropriate treatment. I've got to hand it to her.\"\n\nNorthwell's Solazzo added, \"Cara has been an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of caring for her. Her advocacy and courage will hopefully clear the way for other epilepsy patients who could benefit from this surgery.\"\n\n'Never been more excited'\n\nThe day of the surgery, July 25, was filled with nerves and excitement. Cara's parents and older sister, Lindsey, crowded her hospital room before the operation. They gabbed about trivial, everyday stuff, as families often do.\n\nBut make no mistake. The importance of the day weighed on everyone.\n\nCara told staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset she had \"never been more excited for anything in my life.\" Her first grand mal seizure, when she fell to the floor and shook, came at the age of 9, but she remembers having smaller aura seizures, when she would space out for brief spells, as far back as kindergarten. She can have five seizures in a day, sometimes as many as 30.\n\n\"It's been really, really difficult to live with,\" she said.\n\nCara keeps a box filled with various anti-seizure medications from over the years. About 1/3 of epilepsy patients live with uncontrollable seizures because no available treatment works for them, according to the Epilepsy Foundation.\n\nAs she was wheeled off to the operating room, Dad wrapped his arms around Lindsey and held her, reassuring her that Cara would be OK.\n\nCara had waited until summer to undergo the surgery. That way, she could adjust to any changes in her brain activity before the new school year started.\n\nLaser ablation is still emerging in the care of epilepsy patients, and Cara's mother said she hopes her daughter can serve as an example for other teens who qualify for laser surgery and are afraid of open brain surgery, known as a temporal lobectomy.\n\n\"This really gives people hope who are young and dealing with this -- that they can go forward early on in life and get this procedure done,\" she says.\n\nIn the operating room, the hourlong procedure \"went quite well,\" Mehta said. \"Everything went as planned.\"\n\nThere are only about 40 to 50 centers around the nation, Mehta said, where laser ablation surgeries are performed, with the technique becoming more popular in recent years. Mehta said existing data show about a 50% seizure-free rate for those who undergo laser ablation, compared to about 70% who undergo traditional open brain surgeries.\n\nA comprehensive study is underway to better define its efficacy. But Mehta said he has had better success than the national average: \"My results are about as good as the open temporal lobectomy.\"\n\nThe laser surgery is more appealing to patients and parents, he says, because open surgery can be so daunting. Laser surgery is less invasive, requires less time in the hospital and has a quicker recovery, Mehta said.\n\nCara poses for pictures outside the banquet hall at Nyack Beach State Park as friends snap photos. \"You look like a princess,\" one friend says.\n\nPatients can suffer short-term memory loss, especially forgetting names of people they meet. \"It's not usually something that is devastating, especially when you're younger,\" he says. \"Given that she's young, we believe that her brain is going to be more able to adapt.\"\n\nCara had one grand mal seizure in the days after the surgery, but she'd forgotten to take her anti-seizure medicine the day before. Mehta also says it's not unusual for patients to have seizures in the week or two right after surgery.\n\nBased on her recovery three weeks after surgery, he believes Cara has a 60% to 80% chance of being seizure-free. The benchmark will be a year from now. \"The big question is whether she will have one or two seizures a year or whether she has no seizures,\" Mehta says. \"We want no seizures.\n\n\"I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\"\n\nA new, vibrant Cara\n\nAt her birthday party, the new Cara is on full display. She dances. She laughs. She commands the crowd.\n\nCara's father, Robert, requested a slow dance with his daughter shortly after she blew out the candles on her birthday cake. \"Since the operation,\" he says, \"she has exploded -- just the joy in her personality.\"\n\nHer sister marvels at her transformation. \"She is just flourishing,\" Lindsey says. \"I've never seen her so vibrant and so open with herself.\"\n\nCara says it's been \"weird\" ever since her surgery because \"I feel so much better.\" It's also a bit of an adjustment to think she could actually be seizure-free.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream, but I also know it's real.\"\n\nOn stage, Cara honors 16 of the closest people in her life, and each helps light an individual candle. She begins with her father: \"One of the funniest people I know.\"\n\nThere's the uncle who is \"one of the biggest weirdos I know,\" the friend who \"always knows when to cheer me up\" and the one who \"always has a smile on her face that never seems to leave.\"\n\nShe saves the 16th candle for her mom. Cara praises her as a triathlete and marathon runner, and thanks her for planning the entire party.\n\n\"She was there for me every single time I was in the hospital -- literally the best,\" Cara says. \"Mom, please come up and light the final candle!\"\n\nCara says she hopes she can inspire other teens with seizure disorders to advocate for themselves. \"It's been really, really difficult,\" she says. \"I've had to go through so much.\"\n\nAs the Beatles' \"Here Comes the Sun\" echoes across the room, Mom rushes to hug her daughter.

    "text": "This is the first part of the series,\"Escape from the Mayo Clinic.\" Read the second part here. Also, read how CNN reported this story.\n\nSherburn, Minnesota (CNN) In a jaw-dropping moment caught on video, an 18-year-old high school senior rushes to escape from the hospital that saved her life and then, she says, held her captive.\n\nAt the entrance to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, the young woman's stepfather helps her out of a wheelchair and into the family car.\n\nStaff members come running toward him, yelling \"No! No!\" One of them grabs the young woman's arm.\n\n\"Get your hands off my daughter!\" her stepfather yells.\n\nThe car speeds away, the stepfather and the patient inside, her mother at the wheel.\n\nMayo security calls 911.\n\n\"We have had a patient abduction,\" the security officer tells police, according to a transcript of the call.\n\n'A cautionary tale'\n\nThe patient's name is Alyssa Gilderhus.\n\nShe and her family say she wasn't abducted from the Mayo Clinic in February 2017; rather, she escaped. They say the hospital was keeping her there against her will -- that Mayo \"medically kidnapped\" her.\n\nUnhappy with the care she was receiving at Mayo, they say, they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital. They say Mayo refused.\n\nAccording to police, Mayo officials had a different plan for Alyssa: They had asked the county for assistance in \"gaining guardianship of Alyssa,\" who was an adult.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus before her ruptured aneurysm and two-month hospitilization at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic said hospital officials would be willing to answer CNN's questions if Alyssa signed a privacy release form giving them permission to discuss her case publicly with CNN. The spokeswoman, Ginger Plumbo, supplied that form to CNN.\n\nAlyssa signed the form, but Plumbo declined to answer CNN's questions on the record. Instead, she provided a statement, which said in part, \"We will not address these questionable allegations or publicly share the facts of this complex situation, because we do not believe it's in the best interest of the patient and the family. ... Our internal review determined that the care team's actions were true to Mayo Clinic's primary value that the patient's needs come first. We acted in a manner that honored that value for this patient and that also took into account the safety and well-being of the team caring for the patient.\"\n\nThis story is based on interviews with Alyssa and members of her family, a family friend, law enforcement officials and a former member of a Mayo Clinic board, as well as documents including law enforcement records and Alyssa's medical records.\n\nBy everyone's account, this is an unfortunate and devastating story about a bitter clash that went out of control -- a clash between a Minnesota farm family and one of the world's most revered hospitals.\n\n\"It's confusing to me why this went off the rails so horribly,\" said Richard Saver, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who at CNN's request reviewed medical and legal documents that the family and law enforcement officials provided to CNN.\n\nArt Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, also reviewed the documents, and he agrees.\n\n\"This should never have happened,\" he said. \"This is a cautionary tale.\"\n\nA Christmas Day aneurysm\n\nThe relationship between Alyssa's family and the Mayo Clinic started off well.\n\nOn Christmas morning 2016, Alyssa settled in with a mug of hot chocolate to open her gifts. She was surrounded by her large family: her mother, Amber Engebretson, a stay-at-home mom; Duane Engebretson, her stepfather since she was 4 years old, who manages a construction company and the family's farms; and her five younger siblings, then 18 months to 11 years old.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus on Christmas morning 2016.\n\nThey live in Sherburn, Minnesota, population just over 1,000 people, about 150 miles southwest of Minneapolis, on a farm with sheep, cows, horses and pigs.\n\nAlyssa was thrilled with her first Christmas present: a pair of cowboy boots emblazoned with the emblem of the Future Farmers of America, her favorite club.\n\nThen she went to the bathroom. Her parents heard screaming.\n\n\"Mom, I need you!\" Alyssa yelled as she lay curled up on the floor, vomiting.\n\nIt was immediately obvious this was much more than just a stomach bug. Her left side was very weak, and she couldn't hear out of her left ear.\n\n\"You could see looking at her that she was petrified,\" her stepfather said.\n\nHe called an ambulance. A local hospital determined that Alyssa, who'd always been healthy, had a ruptured brain aneurysm : A blood vessel inside her brain had suddenly and unexpectedly burst.\n\nSurgeons explained that her life was on the line. They drilled a hole in her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain.\n\nA nurse gave her parents a bag of Alyssa's hair, which had been shaved off for the operation. Some people liked to have it, she said.\n\nAmber and Duane cried as they considered that this bag of hair -- their daughter's long, beautiful hair -- might be all they had left if she died.\n\nThey begged to have her sent to the Mayo Clinic. The main campus for the world-renowned medical center was 85 miles away in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n\"They're the best. People come from all over the world to go to Mayo,\" said Alyssa's mother, Amber Engebretson, who worked as a vehicle inspector for the Minnesota State Patrol before staying home to care for her family.\n\nBut Alyssa couldn't get to Mayo immediately. There was an ice storm. Ambulances couldn't drive, and helicopters couldn't fly.\n\nThe weather eventually broke, and about 7 p.m. -- about nine hours after the aneurysm -- Alyssa finally arrived by ambulance at Mayo headquarters in Rochester.\n\nOn Christmas night, surgeons gave her a 2% chance of living, her parents said. Doctors wrote in her medical record that her prognosis was \"grim.\"\n\nHer parents reached out on Facebook for prayers. They called their daughter the #Christmasmiraclegirl.\n\nAlyssa lived up to that name. She survived, thanks to four brain surgeries over the next month. Her doctors were ecstatic.\n\n\"They were like, she's not supposed to be here. She beat the odds,\" her stepfather said.\n\n\"Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life,\" added her mother. \"We'll be grateful to them forever.\"\n\nOn January 30, Alyssa was transferred from the neurology unit to the rehabilitation unit.\n\nIt should have been a happy turning point. But that's when the troubles began.\n\nTensions flare\n\nAlthough all had gone smoothly on the neurology floor, the family got into conflicts with the rehab staff almost immediately.\n\nFirst, doctors there wanted to take Alyssa off oxycodone, a powerful opioid painkiller that the neurology doctors had prescribed for pain after surgery. Her most recent surgery -- the fourth in one month -- had been just a few days before.\n\n\"She'd lay in bed with tears coming out of her eyes because she was in so much pain,\" her stepfather said.\n\nMany medical authorities, including the Mayo Clinic's website , say opioids are critical for post-surgical pain management.\n\nA week after Alyssa arrived on the rehabilitation floor, her mother shared her feelings on Facebook.\n\n\"[Alyssa's] and my frustration level was high and it seems that they just don't listen sometimes,\" Amber wrote on February 7.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her mother and stepfather, Amber and Duane Engebretson, and her younger siblings.\n\nMore disputes arose. Her parents say their daughter's breathing tube was the wrong size, and they had to pester doctors to get it corrected. They also say the family -- not doctors -- discovered that she had a bladder infection. They say a social worker discussed private financial information within earshot of visiting friends and relatives.\n\nHer parents asked for the social worker and a doctor to be replaced.\n\n\"We just need someone who will at least listen to us and hear us,\" Amber wrote on her Facebook page on February 20.\n\nAlyssa's parents say that at their request, they had a meeting with her care team on February 21.\n\n\"I had two whiteboards filled up with questions left unanswered, tests left undone, and every other question we could think of,\" Amber wrote on her Facebook page that day.\n\nAmber says that at one point during that meeting, she told the staff she felt like they \"don't give a f***,\" later apologizing for her language. She also asked for a second doctor to stop taking care of their daughter.\n\n\"We took no crap and laid it all on the line. ... Because seriously what do we have to lose at this point,\" Amber wrote on Facebook that night.\n\nMayo kicks Mom out\n\nOn February 22, the day after that meeting, Amber got into a disagreement with a nursing aide and asked to have her removed from her daughter's care team. She was the fourth staffer the family had asked to be replaced in just three weeks.\n\nThat afternoon, Amber says, she was scheduled to have a meeting with the social worker -- the same one she'd asked to leave her daughter's care.\n\nAmber had requested the meeting, and she says that as she approached the office at the appointed time, a man she'd never seen was standing in the office doorway. She said he saw her coming and went into the office and shut the door.\n\nAmber listened through the door. She says that as she suspected, the man and the social worker were talking about her family.\n\n\"I proceeded to open the door and say, 'Since you're talking about my family, I think it's only appropriate that I would be here also, to be included in the conversation,' \" she remembers.\n\nShe says the man puffed out his chest and stepped toward her, and she took a backward step into the hall. The man, who Amber later learned was a physician, demanded that she leave.\n\nShe says the man told her, \"I run this whole rehab unit. Do you understand me?\"\n\nAmber describes the doctor as \"intensely aggressive.\"\n\nShe replied to him, she says, with similar aggression and frustration: \"I need to talk to you. Do you understand me?\"\n\nThe doctor walked away.\n\nCNN reached out to this doctor and other staff members involved in Alyssa's care but did not receive responses.\n\nAbout an hour later, Alyssa's parents say, the same doctor, the social worker and a nurse approached the family. They were accompanied by three security guards.\n\n\"[The doctor] said to me, 'You are not allowed to participate in Alyssa's care. You are not allowed on Mayo property. You will be escorted off the premises right now,' \" Amber remembers.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her mother, Amber Engebretson.\n\nAmber and Duane say they asked why Amber was being kicked out but did not receive an answer.\n\nLater, a social worker would tell police that \"Amber interrupted a meeting because Amber was upset over the care Alyssa was receiving. Due to that incident, Amber was escorted off of [Mayo] property.\"\n\nAccording to Alyssa's parents, the doctor told Duane that he could stay but that he would not be allowed to have any involvement in his stepdaughter's care.\n\nThe couple say they asked the doctor whether they could speak with a patient advocate.\n\n\"He said, 'There is no patient advocate,' and walked away,\" Amber said.\n\nWhen asked about Amber's dismissal from the hospital, Mayo spokeswoman Plumbo sent CNN a statement.\n\n\"Our care teams act in the best interests of our patients. As a general practice, this includes sharing information with family members and facilitating family visits and interactions with patients and their care providers when the patient is in our care. However, in situations where care may be compromised or the safety and security of our staff are potentially at risk, the family members' ability to be present in the hospital may be restricted.\"\n\nPlumbo did not elaborate on whether or how Amber compromised her daughter's care or placed staff at risk.\n\n\"We would never compromise her care,\" Amber said. \"She's our daughter. We love her.\"\n\nShe also says she never put staff members at risk. \"We would never do that -- ever,\" she said.\n\nOn February 23, the day after Amber was kicked out, she went on Facebook.\n\n\"PRAYER WARRIORS UNITE!!!! We need your help. ... Please READ THIS AND SHARE THIS POST in hopes it reaches the people or person who can help us,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I HAVE BEEN TOLD I AM NOT ALLOWED IN ALYSSA'S ROOM AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY SAY OR PARTICIPATE IN HER [CARE]. ... I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER!! We have been given no reason why, no paperwork, and no explanations,\" she continued. \"I never imagined something like this could happen in our world and a very hard situation already has been made even harder!!\"\n\nThe response from one Facebook user led the family to conclude that they needed to get Alyssa out of Mayo, and fast.\n\n'Basically a prisoner at Mayo'\n\nAlyssa, who was legally an adult during her entire hospitalization, says that around this time, she started asking doctors and nurses to transfer her to another facility.\n\nShe says she never received a response.\n\n\"They were cruel to me,\" Alyssa said, adding that she wanted to get out of Mayo \"as bad as possible.\"\n\nOn February 23, three weeks into her daughter's stay in rehab, Amber complained on Facebook, tagging Mayo.\n\n\"They refuse to let her go. ... We cannot transfer [Alyssa] out or get her discharged,\" she wrote. \"No one has any say in [Alyssa's care] and she is basically a prisoner of Mayo.\"\n\nAlyssa's stepfather and grandmother say they also asked to have her transferred out of Mayo.\n\n\"I asked two to three times a day, and it would go nowhere,\" Duane said.\n\n\"Duane said, 'This is ridiculous. We don't want her here; Alyssa doesn't want to be here; she doesn't feel safe here,' \" her grandmother Aimee Olson remembers. \"But there was no response.\"\n\nDuane says he tried to talk to a senior doctor on the rehab staff about a transfer. It was the same doctor who had asked his wife to leave the hospital.\n\n\"He said 'I have nothing to say to you. This is a legal problem,' \" Duane remembers. \"I even asked him, 'can I speak to your supervisor, your boss,' and his exact words were 'I run this whole floor,' and [he] turned around and walked out of the room, and that was it.'\n\nDuane says he called the Mayo Patient Experience office and in a 45-minute phone call described the family's grievances. He said the patient experience specialist told him he would be back in touch after getting Mayo's side of the story.\n\nOlson, Alyssa's grandmother and Amber's mother, said she also tried to speak with the senior doctor but was told he wasn't available.\n\n\"She was truly being held captive,\" Olson said. \"I would never believe a hospital could do that -- never in my wildest dreams.\"\n\nThe family and a friend say they were instructed by Mayo staff not to talk to Alyssa about her mother.\n\nTwo nurses were assigned to be with Alyssa, and they kept careful watch, according to visitors.\n\n\"It was like they were watching every move you made,\" said Joy Schmitt, Alyssa's boyfriend's mother, who visited frequently after Amber was asked to leave the hospital.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her younger sister resting at the Mayo Clinic.\n\n'They were taking over our daughter'\n\nOn February 21, the day before her mother was kicked out of the hospital, a Mayo psychiatrist examined Alyssa and found that she lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions, according to a summary of her care that her doctors wrote after she left Mayo.\n\nAround this time, a hospital social worker went to adult protection services in two counties to try to get those authorities to get guardianship over Alyssa, according to the police. If they had succeeded, she would have become a ward of the state.\n\nAlyssa and her family say that they weren't told any of this as it was happening but that around this time, they started to feel that Mayo was isolating Alyssa.\n\nOn February 26, staffers confiscated Alyssa's cell phone, laptop and tablet after finding that she'd made a video for her mother, according to Alyssa and her family. They say Alyssa's visitors were also banned from bringing their devices into the hospital.\n\nJUST WATCHED Alyssa Gilderhus' video for her mom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Alyssa Gilderhus' video for her mom 00:24\n\nThe same day, Mayo staffers said no one would be allowed to stay overnight with Alyssa, according to Duane and Amber's sister, April Chance, who attended a meeting with Alyssa's care team.\n\nDuane says he asked the staff to reconsider. He said his stepdaughter had never spent the night alone in the hospital. But he says they refused.\n\n\"The doctors said they were doing this for Alyssa's own benefit,\" Duane said.\n\nThe family says the doctors also told them that visitors would no longer be allowed to attend Alyssa's treatment sessions, such as physical and occupational therapy.\n\n\"I said, 'We're her cheerleaders. We cheer her on,' \" her aunt remembers. \"And they said 'No, you're impeding her care.' \"\n\nShe said the staff didn't elaborate on how they were impeding her care.\n\n\"They were restricting us little by little from even being with Alyssa. They were taking over our daughter,\" Duane said.\n\nMayo also pushed back Alyssa's discharge date, which was supposed to be February 27.\n\nMeanwhile, her mother's following was growing on Facebook, with many users posting angry messages that tagged Mayo.\n\nOne woman sent Amber links to stories about a teenager named Justina Pelletier.\n\nArticles in The Boston Globe and elsewhere described how in 2013, Pelletier, then 14 years old, was placed in state custody for nearly 16 months after Boston Children's Hospital accused her parents of interfering in her care. She spent much of that time in a psychiatric ward.\n\nAmber says she spoke on the phone with Justina's parents, Linda and Lou Pelletier. She says they warned her there would be signs that the hospital was seeking guardianship for their daughter. They would keep a tight watch over her and limit her communications with her family.\n\nThrough their lawyer, John T. Martin, the Pelletiers confirmed that they had conversations with Amber.\n\nA spokeswoman for Boston Children's Hospital told CNN that the hospital is \"committed to the best interest of our patients' health and well-being\" and declined to discuss the specifics of the case.\n\nAmber sent a text to the woman who'd sent her the news articles.\n\n\"OMG I am SICK. This is what is happening,\" Amber wrote. \"It rings lots and lots of bells. ... Omg ... I am so scared.\"\n\nA Mayo board member steps in\n\nAlyssa's parents reached out to a friend of a friend for help: Mark Gaalswyk, who at the time was a member of the board of directors for the Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont, Minnesota.\n\nGaalswyk emailed a Mayo Clinic vice president. He informed her of the situation and explained that CNN had contacted the family.\n\n\"Could you please please do what you can to get your arms around the [situation] immediately?!\" he wrote. \"Please get to the bottom of this quickly before it blows up even more.\"\n\nBut Gaalswyk's pull wasn't enough.\n\nHe says Mayo treated Alyssa \"terribly.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"I'm probably the most pro-Mayo person who has walked the face of this earth,\" said Gaalswyk, who left the board January 1. \"But this was a mess.\"\n\nHe said he thinks Amber probably \"used words she shouldn't have\" with hospital staff.\n\n\"I'm not saying that Amber is 100 percent in the right,\" he added, \"but I know what Mayo did is not OK at all.\"\n\nIn its statement to CNN, the Mayo spokeswoman said that \"Mayo Clinic is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all the patients we treat.\"\n\nFeeling like they were running out of options, Alyssa's parents then enlisted the help of Karie Rego, an attorney and patient advocate they'd met on Facebook.\n\nOn February 27, Rego spoke on the phone with Joshua Murphy, Mayo's chief legal officer, and faxed him a letter urging Mayo to transfer Alyssa to another facility.\n\n\"Given what has happened here, an expedited transfer this coming week would be best for everyone,\" she wrote.\n\nRego says an attorney in Murphy's office called her later. She says that he told her he couldn't speak with her and that she never heard anything more from Mayo's legal department.\n\nThat night, Alyssa's parents thought about Justina Pelletier and the 16 months she spent in state custody.\n\nThey went online and printed a form for Alyssa to sign, saying she was leaving the hospital against medical advice.\n\nBut her parents didn't know how they would get her out. Two nurses were assigned to keep watch over her at all times.\n\nThey started to hatch a plan to get her out of Mayo the very next day.\n\n",

    "text": "This is the second part of the series,\"Escape from the Mayo Clinic.\" Read the first part here.\n\nSherburn, Minnesota (CNN) One winter afternoon last year, Duane Engebretson sat in his stepdaughter's hospital room at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, trying to figure out how she could escape.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus, 18 and a senior in high school, had been a patient at Mayo for about two months, ever since having a ruptured brain aneurysm on Christmas Day.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus before her ruptured brain aneursym and hospitilization at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nMayo neurosurgeons saved her life, but she and her parents were unhappy with the care she was receiving in the rehabilitation unit, and they say they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred.\n\nBut they say Mayo refused to let her transfer to another hospital, even after a lawyer wrote a letter asking Mayo to make the arrangements.\n\nAlyssa and her family began to suspect that Mayo was trying to get a guardian appointed to make medical decisions for her. They were right: Hospital staffers would later tell police that they had gone to two county adult protection agencies to make guardianship arrangements.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her siblings at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDuane and his wife, Amber Engebretson, weren't sure how to get their daughter out of Mayo. Two nurses had been assigned to watch over her at all times.\n\nBut on February 28, 2017, an idea struck Duane as he sat in Alyssa's hospital room.\n\nHe looked at one of the nurses. She had been with them a few weeks before, when Alyssa's great-grandmother had come for a visit.\n\nBetty Stalheim was 80. She'd just had knee surgery. She was fragile.\n\nIf he told the nurses that Grandma Betty wanted to visit but couldn't make it all the way upstairs to Alyssa's room, it might just sound believable, he figured.\n\nHe put his plan into action about 4 p.m., with his 9-year-old daughter, Allie, secretly videotaping with a small GoPro camera hidden in her hand. He told CNN he wanted the videotape to show that Alyssa had left the hospital willingly and that he hadn't been violent with staff, and to record actions taken by Mayo employees.\n\nDuane told the nurses he wanted to take Alyssa downstairs to say hello to Grandma Betty in the lobby.\n\nThe video shows Duane pushing Alyssa in her wheelchair down the hospital hallway. She has a bandage on her neck where her breathing tube had been removed a few days before.\n\nTwo women in scrubs follow them.\n\nWhen the group arrives in the lobby, there is no Grandma Betty.\n\nDuane says he sees Grandma Betty's car at the entrance and walks out the hospital doors with the two staff members trailing behind him.\n\nAs he approaches the car, the front passenger door opens.\n\nThere is no Grandma Betty. She was never there. Instead, Alyssa's mother is in the driver's seat.\n\n\"Alyssa, we're going to go home, honey. Come on,\" Amber says to her daughter.\n\nAs Duane helps his stepdaughter out of the wheelchair and into the passenger seat, the two women in scrubs run toward her, and someone yells, \"No!\"\n\n\"Yes, she is! Yes, she is!\" Duane and Amber yell back.\n\nThe video shows a hand grabbing Alyssa's arm as Duane helps her into the car. A nursing aide would later tell police she had tried to grab her.\n\n\"Get your hands off my daughter,\" Duane yells at the aide.\n\nDuane closes the car door and gets in the back seat.\n\n\"Get out of here, Amber,\" he tells his wife. \"Go, go, go, go, go, go!\"\n\nThe car drives away from Mayo.\n\nRecalling her escape some months later, Alyssa says it felt \"phenomenal.\"\n\n\"It was like the biggest weight off my shoulders,\" she said.\n\n'We have a patient abduction'\n\nAt 4:28 p.m., a Rochester Police dispatcher received a call from Mayo Clinic security.\n\n\"We have a patient abduction,\" the caller said.\n\nAn officer arrived on the scene 20 minutes later.\n\nA Mayo social worker told him that Alyssa \"cannot make decisions for herself\" and that her mother couldn't care for her \"because Amber has mental health issues.\"\n\nThe social worker also told police she \"understood there was no formal diagnosis\" for Amber.\n\nAmber told CNN she has no history of mental illness and took offense to the social worker making such an unqualified pronouncement.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus as a child with her grandmother Betty Stalheim, mother, Amber Engebretson, and younger siblings.\n\n\"It's absolutely absurd,\" Amber said. \"She said it to the police department. She has no reasoning. She has no justification.\"\n\nThe social worker told the police she'd been working with adult protection services in two Minnesota counties \"trying to get emergency guardianship\" but had been unable to get court orders to do so.\n\nAn Olmsted County Adult Protective Services official told police that \"Mayo was requesting [assistance] in gaining guardianship of Alyssa because they were concerned for the mother's mental health and the medical decisions that were being made for Alyssa.\"\n\nBut something didn't quite make sense to John Sherwin, captain of investigations for the Rochester Police Department.\n\nIf Alyssa couldn't make decisions for herself, as the social worker had said, and if she needed a legal guardian appointed for her, then who had been making decisions for her while she was in the hospital?\n\nWhen police asked that question of Mayo staffers, Sherwin said, they replied that Alyssa had been making her own medical decisions.\n\n\"When doctors were consulting with her in regards to her medical care, they weren't doing so through a guardian or someone that had been appointed by the courts. It was in direct contact with the patient,\" Sherwin said.\n\nHe said it became clear to investigators that Alyssa \"in fact could make decisions on her own\" -- including the decision to leave the hospital against medical advice.\n\n\"There was no abduction. This was done under her own will,\" he said. \"You had a patient that left the hospital under their own planning.\"\n\nThough satisfied that Alyssa was capable of making her own decisions, Sherwin still was concerned about her health.\n\n\"What was relayed to us [by Mayo staff] was that the patient was in danger of dying if they were not in the hospital,\" Sherwin said.\n\nMayo sent the police an order for a 72-hour hold, which allows police to admit someone to a hospital emergency room against their will if they're a danger to themselves.\n\nBut first, the police had to find Alyssa.\n\nPolice search for Alyssa\n\nAlyssa and her parents were on the run. They weren't answering their cell phones, and they weren't at home, either.\n\nThey later told CNN they figured the police would bring Alyssa to a hospital, and given the large number of Mayo facilities in Minnesota, there was a good chance that hospital would be a Mayo hospital.\n\n\"We felt that if [Mayo] got their hands on her, they would latch on and we wouldn't get her back again,\" Duane said.\n\nAlyssa moments after she escaped from the Mayo Clinic with the help of her parents.\n\nUnable to find the family, the police pinged their cell phones. This pointed them to an Applebee's restaurant in Mankato, Minnesota, about 85 miles west of Rochester. Officers searched the restaurant and a nearby Five Guys but couldn't find Alyssa, according to a Mankato police report.\n\nIt turned out the ping was a bit off: The family was down the street at Walmart, purchasing a wheelchair, a walker and a syringe for Alyssa's feeding tube, which Duane says he'd been trained to use. They then checked into a nearby hotel.\n\nWhile at the hotel, the family received a phone call from a Martin County sheriff's deputy. They say they told the deputy that their daughter was doing well, and they planned to bring her to a doctor the next day to get her checked.\n\nThe deputy said that wasn't good enough. He told them they were on their way to them, according to the family.\n\nAlyssa and her parents scrambled and left the hotel.\n\nIt was now almost 9 p.m., and nearly five hours had passed since they'd left Mayo. The family was on the road with three police agencies -- Rochester, Mankato and Martin County -- on their heels.\n\nAs Alyssa's stepfather drove down the highway, a sheriff's deputy called, urging them to bring their daughter to a hospital right away. They told him they'd bring her to a hospital in Jackson, about 75 miles away.\n\nBut then, the family reconsidered. They'd chosen Jackson because it had a hospital that wasn't owned by Mayo. But they feared that the doctors there might transfer her to a Mayo facility.\n\nAfter the calls from police, Alyssa's parents figured out that their phones were being pinged and took the batteries out.\n\nThey got off the highway and drove on gravel roads without a map.\n\n\"I just kept heading west. I knew I would run into South Dakota sooner or later,\" he said.\n\n'This kid is in danger'\n\nThe next afternoon, March 1, one of Alyssa's doctors, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Mayo, spoke on the phone with Sherry Bush-Seim, a Rochester police investigator.\n\nThe doctor warned that Alyssa was in grave danger.\n\n\"The longer she's away, the higher likelihood that she's gonna get very, very sick,\" the physician said, according to a transcript of the conversation that police provided to CNN.\n\nThe day Alyssa left Mayo, that doctor and a colleague had written a discharge note.\n\n\"Alyssa's medical condition, medical status, cognition, and physical impairments require an ongoing inpatient level of medical care,\" the doctors wrote. \"She was not medically or functionally safe to leave the hospital at the time of her removal from the hospital by her stepfather.\"\n\nAlyssa was at risk for pneumonia, malnourishment, dehydration, aspiration, infection and falling, according to the note. She didn't have her medications with her, and her parents weren't trained on how to use her feeding tube, according to the discharge summary.\n\nThe doctor said Alyssa was probably \"a ways from here by now\" and requested a wider-scale search.\n\n\"[It's] incredibly frustrating that something isn't out nationally given that [this] family may be hopping from doctor to doctor,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"We wouldn't do that nationally,\" Bush-Seim responded. \"That wouldn't be done.\"\n\nWithout a national search, the doctor said, \"we're not gonna find her.\"\n\nBush-Seim assured the physician that the Rochester police had \"done everything they possibly could to find her.\"\n\n\"There's got to be something more. This kid is in danger,\" Alyssa's doctor responded.\n\nThe police back off\n\nBut other doctors disagreed with the Mayo physician.\n\nLess than 12 hours after leaving Mayo, she and her parents arrived at the emergency room for Sanford Medical Center in Sioux Falls, a teaching hospital for the University of South Dakota.\n\nThey explained to Sanford doctors that she'd had an aneurysm and left Mayo against medical advice, according to medical records from that emergency room visit.\n\nThe Sanford doctors disagreed with the Mayo doctors on two crucial points.\n\nAlthough Mayo doctors had insisted that Alyssa needed to be in the hospital, the Sanford doctors came to the opposite conclusion: They prescribed Alyssa medications, gave instructions for her to follow up with a doctor and told her she could go home.\n\nMayo had determined that Alyssa lacked the mental capacity to make her own decisions. The Sanford doctors again came to the opposite conclusion: They allowed her to make her own decisions and sign her own forms consenting to treatment.\n\nWhen police learned that a hospital had cleared Alyssa to go home, they stepped aside.\n\n\"If a doctor at another facility says she's fine and comes up with a second opinion, that kind of takes the law out of it,\" said Chris Vasvick, a Martin County sheriff's deputy. \"That's one doctor's opinion against another, and that doesn't have anything to do with law enforcement at all.\"\n\nSherwin, the Rochester detective, agreed.\n\n\"We didn't have any reason for the police to intervene,\" Sherwin said.\n\nHe added that Alyssa and her parents had done nothing illegal. No charges were filed against them.\n\n\"As parents, they were probably thinking that they were acting on her best interest. I think the same could be said for the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic. I think that they also felt they were acting on her best interest,\" Sherwin said.\n\nA few days after her visit to the Sanford emergency room, Alyssa and her parents went home.\n\nA letter from Mayo was waiting for them, thanking Duane for getting in touch with the patient experience office.\n\nThe family found it ironic, given that it was dated March 1, the day after Alyssa left the hospital.\n\nA few days later, another letter arrived from an administrator at Mayo, saying that it would not treat Alyssa or her parents.\n\n\"We have made this decision because of your actions which demonstrate a lack of trust and confidence in Mayo,\" the administrator wrote.\n\nOn Facebook, Amber shared that Alyssa's health was improving.\n\n\"This kid amazes me every day!! And we all could not be more proud!!\" she wrote.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her parents months after they helped her escape from the Mayo Clinic.\n\n'Hospitals aren't prisons'\n\nTo understand the legal and ethical issues in Alyssa's case, CNN showed experts key documents, including law enforcement reports; a transcript of portions of CNN's interview with Sherwin, the detective at the Rochester Police Department; and summaries of her care written by doctors at Mayo and Sanford.\n\nThe experts emphasized that those documents don't tell the whole story; only a thorough reading of her full medical records and interviews with Mayo staff would provide a complete picture.\n\n\"You're only hearing one side,\" cautioned Dr. Chris Feudtner, a professor of pediatrics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nAfter reviewing the documents, the experts wondered why Mayo did not allow Alyssa, who was 18 and legally an adult, to leave the hospital when she made clear that she wanted to be transferred, according to the family.\n\nThey said that typically, adult patients have the right to leave the hospital against medical advice, and they can leave without signing any paperwork.\n\n\"Hospitals aren't prisons. They can't hold you there against your will,\" said George Annas, an attorney and director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nBut Alyssa's doctors say she wasn't a typical patient.\n\n\"Due to the severity of her brain injury, she does not have the capacity to make medical decisions,\" her doctors wrote in her records after she'd left the hospital.\n\nIn that report, the doctors specified that assessments in the last week of her hospital stay showed that she lacked \"the capacity to decide to sign releases of information, make pain medication dose changes, and make disposition decisions. This includes signing paperwork agreeing to leave the hospital against medical advice.\"\n\nThat hadn't jibed with the captain of investigations for the Rochester police. Sherwin said it didn't make sense that Mayo staffers told police Alyssa had been making her own decisions, yet in the discharge note, they stated she wasn't capable of making her own decisions.\n\nIt didn't jibe with the experts, either.\n\n\"They can't eat their cake and have it, too,\" said Feudtner, the medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nEven if Alyssa truly did lack the capacity to make her own medical decisions, the experts had questions about Mayo's efforts to obtain emergency guardianship for Alyssa.\n\nBrian Smith, the Rochester police officer who responded to Mayo's 911 call the day Alyssa left Mayo, said a Mayo social worker told him she'd been working for a week or two to get a Minnesota county to take guardianship over Alyssa.\n\n\"The county would have guardianship over her and would make decisions for her,\" he told CNN.\n\nIf that happened, Alyssa most likely would have stayed at Mayo, as she was already receiving treatment there, Smith said.\n\nBush-Seim, the Rochester police investigator, spoke with an official at one of the county adult protection agencies. She said it was also her understanding that Mayo wanted the county to take guardianship of Alyssa, or that perhaps Mayo itself wanted to directly take guardianship of her.\n\nThe legal experts said they were not surprised that Mayo was unable to get court orders for such guardianship arrangements. It's a drastic and highly unusual step for a county or a hospital to take guardianship over a patient, they said, rather than have a family member become the patient's surrogate decision-maker.\n\nRobert McLeod, a Minneapolis attorney who helped the state legislature draft its guardianship laws, did not review the documents pertaining to Alyssa, as he did not want to comment on any specific case.\n\nHe said that before appointing a county or a hospital as a legal guardian, a judge would ask why a family member or close friend hadn't been selected as a surrogate.\n\n\"From my 25 years of experience, a judge is going to say, 'why isn't the family the first and best choice here?' and it had better be a good reason,\" said McLeod, an adjunct professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\n\nOther experts agreed.\n\nSaver, the professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said that in his four years working in the general counsel's office at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Health System, he doesn't once remember the hospital seeking guardianship for a patient who had a responsible relative or friend who could act as surrogates.\n\n\"It's thought of as kind of the atom bomb remedy,\" Saver said. \"I'm a little flummoxed what to make of this. They had family members on the scene to look to.\"\n\nAlyssa said her biological father, Jason Gilderhus, told her that Mayo asked him to become her guardian. He did not become her guardian and did not respond to CNN's attempts to reach him.\n\nEven if Mayo had concerns about Alyssa's mother and her biological father didn't work out, there were other friends and relatives to turn to, such as her stepfather, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt or boyfriend's mother.\n\n\"It's so baffling why they didn't try to designate a surrogate before trying to get a guardian,\" added Dr. R. Gregory Cochran, a physician and lawyer and associate director of the Health Policy and Law program at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.\n\nAnother feature of Alyssa's case also surprised the experts.\n\nCaplan, the NYU bioethicist, said that in complicated and contentious cases like this one, doctors typically reach out to their hospital's ethics committee for help.\n\nAn ethics committee would listen to the doctors, other staff members, the patient and the family to try to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe family says no one ever mentioned an ethics committee to them, and there's no mention of an ethics committee consult in the discharge summary in Alyssa's medical records.\n\nAnnas, the lawyer at Boston University, agreed that an ethics committee consultation would have been an obvious and important way to help resolve the dispute before it spun out of control.\n\n\"Disputes between families and hospital staff happen all the time, and they can either escalate or de-escalate,\" Annas said. \"An ethics consult can help sort out the issues so they de-escalate.\"\n\nThe experts said they were disappointed that in Alyssa's case, the conflict escalated.\n\n\"I was shocked to see that parents had to pull a fast one to get their daughter out of the hospital,\" said Cochran, of the University of California.\n\n\"I felt sad,\" said Feudtner, the ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Viewed in its entirety, this did not go well for anybody who was involved.\"\n\nGaalswyk, the former Mayo board member, said he hopes the hospital learns something.\n\n\"I hope that someone somewhere will look at what happened in this unfortunate case and improve both our Mayo employee's actions and patient systems so that it not need happen again to any other patient at Mayo,\" he wrote a Mayo vice president after Alyssa left the hospital. \"The situation need not get out of hand like it did.\"\n\nBeing 'held hostage in an American hospital'\n\nWhile the details of Alyssa's case are extraordinary -- the Grandma Betty trick, the escape from the hospital with police on their heels -- the core of her story is not uncommon in many ways, according to patient advocates.\n\nDr. Julia Hallisy, founder of the Empowered Patient Coalition, says families often tell her that a hospital won't allow their loved one to transfer to another facility. Often, they're afraid to say anything publicly or on social media.\n\n\"You sound like a crazy person -- that your family member was held hostage in an American hospital,\" she said. \"People can't believe that would happen. It's like the stuff of a science fiction story.\"\n\nKristen Spyker said it happened to her family.\n\nWhen Spyker's son was born with a rare heart defect, she says she told doctors at the Ohio hospital where he was born that she wanted him to have a surgical repair at a hospital with a larger pediatric heart program.\n\nShe said the heart surgeon at the first hospital refused to send her son's medical records to other hospitals. She also says a surgeon resisted her efforts to transfer her newborn son to another hospital to get a second opinion on what surgery he should have for a rare heart defect.\n\n\"The surgeon said, 'This is my patient. This is my show. I'm the boss, and I say what happens,' \" she said.\n\nShe said a social worker, accompanied by hospital security guards, then came into her son's hospital room and said she was worried that Spyker had postpartum depression that was affecting her ability to make decisions for her son's care.\n\nSpyker said the hospital discharged her son only after she threatened legal action.\n\nHer son then had a successful procedure at another hospital -- a different procedure than the one recommended by the first doctor.\n\nWhen she told her story on Facebook, Spyker said, other parents shared similar stories.\n\n\"It was parent after parent after parent saying 'this happened to us,'\" she said. \"They had been so embarrassed to talk about it, but they felt freer when I said it happened to us.\"\n\nSpyker was one of several people who spoke with Alyssa's parents last year while their daughter was at Mayo.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the American Hospital Association addressed conflicts between families and hospitals.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Communication between physicians and patients is extremely important in working to identify the best treatment,\" said Dr. Jay Bhatt, senior vice president and chief medical officer of the organization. \"Each patient is unique. It is for this reason that the majority of hospitals have patient advocates on staff to help patients and families navigate the care process. Hospitals recognize that patients are critical members of any care team and many are employing new strategies to ensure their voice and perspective is heard and accounted for.\"\n\nWhen hospitals and families get into intense conflict, Hallisy, a dentist who practices in San Francisco, says human emotions can run amok. She says she saw it happen when her daughter, Katherine, was being treated for cancer.\n\n\"People think that doctors are immune to petty disagreements, but they're human beings, and sometimes ego and primitive emotions take over,\" she said.\n\nShe said that in Alyssa's case, she wonders whether a sensitive hospital staffer, perhaps a social worker, could have prevented the situation from becoming as contentious as it did.\n\nShe thinks back to her daughter, who died at age 10. She remembers the sadness and fear of having a very sick child, as well as the stress of taking care of her two other children and keeping her dental practice afloat while her daughter was in and out of the hospital.\n\nShe thinks about how Alyssa was near death and how her parents had five younger children 130 miles away, as well as farms and a family business to run.\n\n\"They were under incredible stress,\" Hallisy said. \"They'd almost lost a child, and they had other responsibilities, too. You would think that someone at Mayo would be trained to see that.\"\n\nThe prom queen graduates\n\nMore than a year after leaving the Mayo Clinic, Alyssa, now 20, has belied her \"grim prognosis.\"\n\nThe students of Martin County West High School crowned Alyssa Gilderhus prom queen.\n\nLast year, she graduated from Martin County West High School, receiving a standing ovation from her class. She stayed out all night at her senior prom, where her classmates voted her prom queen. The local chapter of Future Farmers of America gave her the Star Farmer award.\n\nHer feeding tube came out a few months after she left Mayo, and she can eat and speak normally now. She can walk on her own without any assistance. Last summer, she presented her fantail pigeons at the Minnesota State Fair and competed in the poultry princess competition.\n\nShe finished up her physical and speech therapy in March, about a year after leaving Mayo. She'll be a freshman at Southwest Minnesota State University in September.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus on her family's farm in Sherburn, Minnesota.\n\nAlyssa has not filed a lawsuit, but has engaged Martin, the lawyer who is also representing the Pelletier family.\n\nAlyssa and her parents say they haven't recovered emotionally from what happened at Mayo. They say they still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, panicked about what would have happened if they hadn't snuck her out of the hospital.\n\n\"I think she would be [at the hospital] and nobody would be able to see her,\" her stepfather said.\n\nThey say Mayo still hasn't given them an explanation for why it was trying to arrange guardianship for Alyssa.\n\nThey think Mayo was trying to get guardianship in retaliation for questioning the staff, especially a senior physician.\n\n\"I think that the doctor I made mad wanted to make sure that I paid for it no matter what,\" her mother said.\n\nShe's told that's a pretty hefty accusation.\n\n\"We stand by it 100 percent,\" her stepfather said.",

    "text": "(CNN) As Katie Stubblefield brushed her fingers across her face, she could feel the wound.\n\nHer vision is greatly impaired due to her injury, but touching her face allowed her to feel what her doctors were working around the clock to treat. She could feel where her face was swollen. She could feel the portions that were missing.\n\nThat was before Katie, at 21, became the youngest person in the United States to receive a face transplant. The transplant, performed last year, aims to restore Katie's face structure and functions -- such as chewing, breathing and swallowing -- which were lost in a severe gunshot injury, the haunting outcome of a suicide attempt as a teenager.\n\nNow, Katie hopes to use her historic surgery to raise awareness about the lasting harms of suicide and the precious value of life.\n\nShe is featured on the cover of National Geographic magazine's September issue , which debuted Tuesday, in an article titled \"The Story of a Face\" and in National Geographic's full-length documentary \"Katie's Face.\"\n\n'I had no clue what a face transplant was'\n\nIn the days prior to Katie's suicide attempt, she faced a number of emotional hurdles.\n\nShe underwent surgery for chronic gastrointestinal problems, and she faced betrayal in a personal relationship. Around that time, Katie's mother, Alesia, was abruptly fired from a teaching job at Katie's school because Alesia \"questioned several decisions that were made lacking integrity,\" Katie's father, Robb, told CNN.\n\nAsking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.\n\n\n\nThe International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nOn March 25, 2014, when Katie was 18, her older brother, Robert Stubblefield, heard the gunfire and found her after she harmed herself in a bathroom at his home in Mississippi.\n\nHe was devastated.\n\nKatie doesn't remember that tragic day when she lost her face. She has said that she doesn't remember much of that year -- including being hospitalized in Oxford, Mississippi; being flown to another hospital in Memphis, Tennessee; and then being transferred to Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where she would undergo her face transplantation three years later.\n\nIt was in Memphis where Katie's parents, Robb and Alesia, heard the term \"face transplant\" for the first time.\n\n\"There was an older trauma surgeon who basically told us, 'It's the worst wound that I've ever seen of its kind,' and he said, 'The only thing I can think of that would really give her functional life again is a face transplant,' \" Robb said.\n\n\"I was standing there thinking, 'What do you mean, a face transfer? What do you do?' \"\n\nWhen Katie was later told about the possible procedure, she said, she was equally stunned.\n\n\"I had no clue what a face transplant was,\" Katie said. \"When my parents helped explain everything to me, I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again.\"\n\nAt left, Katie Stubblefield at 17, eight months before attempting suicide. At right, Katie at 22, one year and one month after her surgery.\n\nFull and partial face transplants are medical procedures that involve replacing all or parts of a person's face with donated tissue, including skin, bone, nerves and blood vessels from a deceased donor.\n\nKatie's procedure involved transplanting the scalp, forehead, upper and lower eyelids, eye sockets, nose, upper cheeks, upper jaw and half of lower jaw, upper teeth, lower teeth, partial facial nerves, muscles and skin -- effectively replacing her full facial tissue, according to Cleveland Clinic\n\nPhotos: Face transplants giving people back their lives Photos: Face transplants giving people back their lives Patrick Hardison, 41, had face transplant surgery in August 2015.

Hide Caption 8 of 8\n\nSimilar to Katie, the first recipient of a face transplant in the United States was a woman who survived a gunshot wound to the head. That patient, Connie Culp, underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery at Cleveland Clinic and debuted her new face in 2009.\n\nThat was a near-total face transplant. The world's first successful full face transplant was conducted at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, in 2010.\n\nAs for where Katie fits in, \"only 40 people in the world have ever had a face transplant, and we believe that she is the 39th person,\" said Susan Goldberg, editor-in-chief of National Geographic magazine\n\n\"We think her story is one of the most important stories that we will do this year,\" Goldberg said of the magazine. \"We thought it was just such a moving and inspiring story that is about everything from human journey to breakthrough medicine and science.\"\n\n'You take it for granted, the different components of our faces'\n\nBefore Katie's face transplantation, surgeons at Cleveland Clinic used 3D printing to help reconstruct about 90% of her lower jaw, said Dr. Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at Cleveland Clinic who led Katie's surgery and oversaw her care.\n\nThe surgical team used CT scans of the jaw of Katie's older sister, Olivia McCay, to 3D-print a model template for the reconstruction.\n\n\"We made a plate designed for the combination of Katie and her sister's jaw, and that's what we used to make Katie's jaw before we did the transplant,\" Gastman said.\n\nHe noted that when he first saw Katie's injury, he worried that she might not live.\n\nA surgical resident carefully cradles Katie's head to keep it still as she's situated in the intensive care unit after the 31-hour procedureconcluded. To protect her eyes, her eyelids were sutured shut. With the transplant complete, Katie would still require additional operations and many months of rehabilitation.\n\nIn March 2016, Katie was placed on the waiting list for a face transplant. Fourteen months later, a donor was found: Adrea Schneider, a 31-year-old woman who died of a drug overdose, National Geographic reported. Before the procedure, Katie underwent extensive psychological evaluation as a face transplant candidate and suicide survivor.\n\nAfter she was cleared to receive her new face, the 31-hour surgery began May 4, 2017. It involved 11 surgeons, several other specialists and virtual reality. The surgery was completed the next day.\n\n\"I am able to touch my face now, and it feels amazing,\" said Katie, who still has some difficulty speaking clearly.\n\nHer father, Robb, translated some of her sentiments: \"You take it for granted, the different components of our faces -- the bone, the tissue, the muscle, everything -- but when it's gone, you recognize the big need. Then when you receive a transplant, you're so thankful.\"\n\nNine months and 22 days before Katie's face transplant, at Cleveland's Tudor Arms Hotel, Katie and her father sing \"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\" as they share a dance. \"Before this, I never spent so much time with my parents,\" said Katie, who credits their love and devotion with helping to save her life.\n\nKatie was discharged from Cleveland Clinic on August 1, 2017. She takes immunosuppressive drugs to reduce her risk of transplant rejection , which occurs when a transplant recipient's immune system attacks the transplanted organ or tissue. She will continue to take the medication for the rest of her life.\n\nKatie also continues physical and occupational therapy, works with a speech therapist and takes Braille lessons.\n\nJUST WATCHED Face transplant recipient meets donor's family Replay More Videos ...

A grant from the US Department of Defense, through the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine , covered Katie's transplant, according to National Geographic. The institute works to develop advanced treatment options -- including face transplantation -- for severely wounded servicemen and -women.\n\n\"I remember Dr. Gastman mentioned to me, he said basically that Katie was kind of the quintessential potential candidate for a face transplant. One, because of the type of wound that she suffered, but also she is in that age bracket of so many soldiers,\" Robb said. \"She's in that late-teen to early 20s, where so many young soldiers are being wounded and injured.\"\n\nWhile Katie's medical care team hopes that her surgery can advance the field of face transplantation, there are many other hopes for her future.\n\nJUST WATCHED Man with face transplant speaks about transformation Replay More Videos ...

    "text": "Petersburg, Indiana (CNN) When Christina Potts was looking for permanent birth control, she said, her doctor was a \"cheerleader\" for one option and one option only: Essure.\n\nPotts says the device, which is implanted in a woman's fallopian tubes to block sperm from reaching an egg, left her in terrible pain and extremely fatigued.\n\nIt was so bad that she had a hysterectomy, removing her uterus and tubes to get rid of Essure.\n\nLast week, the US Food and Drug Administration expressed safety concerns about Essure, and Bayer Pharmaceuticals announced that it would pull the device off the market at the end of the year.\n\nPotts says she'll always wonder this: Did her former gynecologist recommend Essure because it was best for her or because Bayer paid the doctor tens of thousands of dollars?\n\nA CNN analysis of federal data, shows that from August 2013 through December 2017, Bayer paid 11,850 doctors $2.5 million related to Essure for consulting fees and similar services.\n\nThese payments are legal but very controversial.\n\nPotts' doctor was one of the highest earners, according to federal data. Dr. Cindy Basinski was paid $168,068 for consulting fees and similar services from August 2013 through the end of 2017.\n\nMore than 80% of the money that Bayer paid to Indiana doctors for Essure was paid to her. Nationally, she was the second highest-paid doctor for the service, one of just three doctors to earn more than $100,000.\n\nThe financial information comes from a federal database that covers August 2013 through the end of last year. Basinski said she also received payments related to Essure for about five years before that, but the database doesn't go back that far, and Basinski says she doesn't remember what she was paid during those years.\n\n\"I will tell you that my best guess is that early on it was very minimal, $5,000 to $7,000 a year,\" she said.\n\nBasinski says she's so convinced of Essure's safety that she'll continue to implant it into women until the device comes off the market.\n\nDr. Cindy Basinski said \"I did a lot of work to earn that money. A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians.\"\n\nIn those studies, the payments are typically much more modest than what Basinski has received. But the gynecologist said her clinical judgment hasn't been swayed by the money.\n\n\"I will say that I do not feel that it influenced me at all in any way,\" she said.\n\nShe said she could have earned the same amount if she'd been seeing patients during the hours she was paid by Bayer to educate doctors about the device and how to implant it.\n\n\"I think that there can be professional relationships with companies and physicians. I did a lot of work to earn that money,\" she said. \"A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians.\"\n\nShe added that she's turned down money -- in some cases more than Bayer paid her -- because she did not believe in a certain product.\n\nBayer announced last week that declining sales is the reason it will pull the device off the market and that it stands by the safety of its product.\n\nBut according to a US Food and Drug Administration statement put out the same day, the device has been associated with \"serious risks including persistent pain, perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen.\"\n\nBayer's announcement came just days before Netflix premiered a documentary about the dangers of Essure and other medical devices, \"The Bleeding Edge.\"\n\nOn Friday, Bayer posted a \"fact check\" to the documentary, which states that the film \"presents an inaccurate and misleading picture of Essure.\"\n\nAlso Friday, the pharmaceutical company published an \"Open Letter to Patients and Providers About Essure,\" which states that the company's decision to stop selling Essure \"was not based on concerns about the safety and efficacy of Essure. Essure has been on the market for more than 15 years and has been successfully used by hundreds of thousands of women.\"\n\nThe Netflix documentary features a group of women who lobbied Congress for years to get Essure off the market.\n\nTheir private Facebook group, Essure Problems, has more than 37,000 members, including more than 12,000 women who say they've had a hysterectomy or other surgical procedure to remove the device, according to group founder Angie Firmalino.\n\n'I felt like she was very pushy'\n\nWhen Potts, who teaches children with special needs in Petersburg, Indiana, gave birth to twins Eli and Brena in 2006, she and her husband knew that they wanted permanent birth control. With four children -- they have an older daughter and son -- their family was complete.\n\nPotts, then 27, asked Basinski about getting her fallopian tubes tied, but she says Basinski told her that wasn't a good choice for a woman with four young children, because it involved recovery time from the surgery. Essure could be implanted vaginally right in the office, in a procedure much like a routine Pap smear.\n\nChristina Potts had a hysterectomy to remove her Essure device.\n\n\"She was very upbeat about it,\" Potts said. \"I felt like she was very pushy.\"\n\nShe and other patients who saw Basinski told CNN that the doctor seemed like a cheerleader for Essure. Potts said that's why she didn't call Basinski when she developed headaches, joint pain, abdominal cramping and extreme fatigue about a year after she got the implant.\n\nShe said she felt so sick that she had to rely on her oldest child, then 8, to help with her three younger children.\n\n\"It was hard,\" she said.\n\nSince the hysterectomy, her symptoms have almost completely gone away, she said.\n\nPotts says she's angry that, in her memory, Basinski dismissed having her tubes tied, also known as tubal ligation, the other option for permanent female birth control.\n\nShe felt \"violated\" because she felt that her choice was taken away.\n\n\"I felt like it was Dr. Basinski's decision, more or less, because she said that this was best, and I wasn't really given another option,\" she said.\n\nBasinski said she couldn't recall her conversation with Potts, but said she felt Potts was not remembering the conversation correctly. She said she routinely gives patients options for sterilization procedures.\n\n\"In my notes I did document that I talked about risks, benefits, and alternatives with her,\" Basinski said.\n\nAnother patient said Basinski also dismissed tubal ligation as an option in favor of Essure. That patient, who requested not to be named to protect her privacy, later went to a different doctor to have a hysterectomy to remove the device.\n\nBasinski says that if it seems to her patients that she stresses Essure, that's only because it's a relatively new device -- it was approved by the FDA in 2002 -- and so it requires more explanation.\n\n\"We go through all of the options and all of the risks and benefits,\" she said. \"It is my obligation to offer patients all available products on the marketplace, explain the risks and benefits and why they may want to choose one or the other.\"\n\nBut Potts and other patients say Basinski's marketing puts that claim into question. She's had YouTube videos, a website and a highway billboard all devoted to Essure.\n\nIn 2009, she appeared on \"The Balancing Act,\" a television show aimed at women, along with Trista Sutter, a former \"Bachelorette\" contestant who had been implanted with the device.\n\nThe host asked about the popularity and risks of Essure.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something, because of Miss Trista here, I think we're going to have women flocking to the doctor's office to get Essure,\" Basinski said. \"When women find out about this, they want this procedure.\"\n\nCNN spoke to two of her former patients who were pleased with Essure.\n\n\"Knowing Dr. Basinski, I don't believe that she would ever be biased in leading a patient towards something that she didn't feel was appropriate for them,\" said Cindy Dossett, who was implanted with Essure in 2008. \"I have always trusted her judgment. She has never given me any reason not to, and I wouldn't say that about all doctors.\"\n\n'That looks like a bribe'\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Bayer said that \"close cooperation with, and continuous education of, healthcare professionals is key to achieving better outcomes for the patients we strive to help.\"\n\nThe statement added that health care professionals \"are compensated for their expertise and the services they provide to the pharmaceutical industry. It is appropriate and ethical for Bayer to compensate medical professionals for the time they spend on these activities.\"\n\nFriday Bayer provided CNN a document outlining the company's procedures for Essure related payments to outside medical experts. \"These agreements between Bayer and its consulting physicians do not compensate them for the use of Essure,\" it states. \"They are not being paid by Bayer to purchase, prescribe, or otherwise support Essure.\"\n\nDr. Martin Makary, a professor of surgery and patient safety expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that although it's ethical for a pharmaceutical company to pay a doctor for genuine research, he doubted that the more than 11,000 doctors paid by Bayer were involved in such efforts.\n\n\"That looks like a bribe,\" he said. \"That looks like gaming the system. That looks like the pharma company is paying off doctors.\"\n\nData on Essure\n\nThe FDA estimates that Essure has been used by more than 750,000 patients worldwide since it was approved on November 4, 2002. At the time, Essure was manufactured and marketed by Conceptus Inc., which Bayer acquired in June 2013.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFrom 2002 through 2017, the patient problems most frequently reported to the FDA were pain/abdominal pain (21,215), heavier menses/menstrual irregularities (9,846), headache (7,231), fatigue (5,842) and weight fluctuations (4,970).\n\nAccording to the FDA , reported adverse events \"cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence, severity or frequency of problems associated with devices\" and \"confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report.\"\n\nIn April, the FDA restricted sales of Essure to only doctors who give patients FDA-approved patient education materials that describe the risks.\n\nBasinski says she wishes women could keep getting Essure beyond the end of this year.\n\n\"I think it is a safe and viable option for women, and I'm very sad that it's not available in the marketplace after December of 2018 for women [for whom] this may be the right option,\" she said.\n\nCNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.",

    "text": "San Francisco, California (CNN) Their first date was over lunch during a Proposition 8 protest, where they joined hundreds of others railing against the passage of California's same-sex marriage ban. The two men took a break from demonstrating, threw their hearts on the table and talked about their desire to have kids.\n\nSo it was somehow appropriate that in June 2013, nearly five years later, Bill Taroli and Yang Li stood in a delivery room and welcomed their son, Henry, one day before the US Supreme Court overturned Prop 8. A couple weeks later, with their newborn in their arms, they exchanged vows and were legally married.\n\nHaving Henry required careful and complicated planning over the course of several years. To become fathers, they needed a support group, legal help, extensive research, reams of documents, reproductive science and about $150,000. But none of that mattered without the help of two women: an egg donor and a surrogate.\n\nOne embryo brought them Henry. Five remaining healthy embryos they kept frozen in storage at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco. They imagined the sibling they might someday give their son and stayed in touch with the women who'd helped give them life once -- and might again someday.\n\n\n\nThen came the news in March. A freezer or cryogenic storage tank at the facility failed, causing the level of liquid nitrogen to dip too low and the temperature to rise. The malfunction jeopardized the status of thousands of eggs and embryos inside, potentially crushing the dreams of hundreds of hopeful parents and families.\n\nThe fate of their embryos would prove significant not just for the fathers but for the women invested in their journey.\n\nThe eggs she wasn't using\n\nTaroli, 47, was adopted by his stepfather and was 20 when he first met his biological dad. When he considered pathways to fatherhood, he was open to a variety of options.\n\nLi, however, was keen on having a biological child, making the decision of how to proceed easy, Taroli said. Henry \"got his sperm and my name.\"\n\nThey scrolled through a registry of possible egg donors provided by the fertility center, studying pictures and written statements. They settled on \"Isabelle,\" a name chosen by the potential donor, and elected to sit down with her in person.\n\nShe was a college student living in Sacramento when she spotted an ad about egg donation. She didn't need to do it financially, as she had family support and scholarships, but she liked the idea of extra spending money and looked ahead toward medical school and the enormous expenses to come.\n\nIsabelle, the name she preferred to go by for this story, also thought about how fixated she was on not getting pregnant, and her mind turned to those who wanted nothing more.\n\n\"Some people are tying so hard to not have something that other people would absolutely love to have happen to them,\" she said by Skype from the United Kingdom, where she's beyond medical school and now doing her residency in Wales. \"I thought, 'I have these eggs. I'm not using them. Someone might as well.'\"\n\nShe also liked the idea of taking part in social innovation and helping families who, without someone else's eggs, might never have children.\n\nIsabelle's mother was befuddled by and against her daughter's decision to donate eggs.\n\n\"No, no, no -- don't do it,\" Isabelle remembered her pleading. \"What's the point?\"\n\nShe ended up going through six egg donation cycles and received $7,000 to $8,000 each time, she said. She was fascinated by the science of it all. Her pre-med friends lined up to give her hormone injections.\n\nMost of her donation cycles went directly to a frozen egg bank, where they'd be used by people she'd never know or meet. But her first cycle, the experience she appreciated most, went to two men who chose her.\n\nShe was excited to meet the people \"who wanted my eggs to be part of their family,\" she said. When they got together in the clinic offices, Taroli did most of the talking and peppered Isabelle with questions. Li, who didn't want to speak for this story, sat by with a clipboard, she remembered. The few questions Li asked were specific: He wanted to know what it was like to grow up bilingual and multicultural.\n\nIsabelle, now 29, has a Portuguese mother and an American father. Henry has American and Chinese dads. And although their backgrounds are different from those of her parents, the couple saw in Isabelle a commonality. She walked away struck by their kindness and thinking how lucky any child of theirs would be.\n\nCapable but 'not interested in carrying my own'\n\nThey came to know their embryos well, including their sexes, through chromosomal testing and biopsies of their cells. Taroli explained that they received rankings, which measured their viability, and the ones they stored -- including the one that would become Henry -- represented their best chances to become parents.\n\nNext, Taroli and Li had to identify their surrogate.\n\nA traditional surrogate is implanted with embryos using her own eggs, but Taroli and Li opted for a gestational carrier, a surrogate who receives through in-vitro fertilization an embryo using somebody else's eggs. The latter process, if they chose a carrier who also lived in California, would be less legally complicated for the gay dads, Taroli explained. The woman's name would not appear on Henry's birth certificate. Instead, both of their names would.\n\nA few hours north of Castro Valley, the community in the East Bay where Taroli and Li live, the woman who would become their surrogate and her husband were happy to be parents to an only child. But she comes from a big family, in which the women generally have five or six kids, and her pregnancy had been \"really, really easy,\" she said.\n\nAn article she read about surrogacy got her thinking. Though pregnancy had been such a breeze for her, she knew that having a family was often a struggle for others. She thought about how some women feel attached to their babies while they're in the womb and how she didn't. It wasn't until after her son was born that she made a connection.\n\nThe surrogate asked to be identified as \"Audrey\" to protect her privacy.\n\n\"I felt emotionally capable of being a surrogate. I felt physically capable,\" Audrey said. \"It seems kind of a waste that I'm so able to carry children but not interested in carrying my own.\"\n\nHer husband, whom she's been with for more than 16 years, also didn't want more children but was in full support of this idea. His mother, Audrey said, was initially disappointed because she still held out hope that they'd give her more grandkids. Audrey's mother and grandmother, however, were completely on board.\n\nIt was her father, divorced from her mother and living several states away, who had the hardest time understanding. The thought of his daughter delivering somebody else's baby, and being part of a process that might include the destruction of embryos, went against his faith. But the two of them had weathered points of friction before, and Audrey, then 30, was prepared to move forward.\n\nIt wasn't about the money for her, although the $27,000 came in handy for the then stay-at-home mom.\n\nShe'd done research into how surrogacy worked and signed up with a surrogacy agency. There were questionnaires for her and her husband to complete, a psychological evaluation she had to clear and medical records that needed to be shared. She suspected that being a surrogate for a woman might become emotionally fraught and was most interested in being a surrogate for a gay couple. She also welcomed the chance to have an ongoing relationship after the birth.\n\nThe agency learned about Taroli and Li and set up a meeting.\n\nWith her husband and 3-year-old son with her, Audrey walked into the family-style restaurant the surrogacy agency had selected. It was initially awkward, sort of like heading into a blind date, she said.\n\n\"They brought me flowers, which was really sweet,\" she remembered. \"You could tell how much they were trying to impress me.\"\n\nLike her husband who works in IT, so does Taroli; Li is in software development. Their initial shyness was something she understood and liked. As they warmed up, they shared their histories, and the two men spoke openly about their hope to be fathers. They told her that they liked the idea of staying in contact with their surrogate, not just during the pregnancy but after, a proposition that made her smile.\n\nShe left feeling like, in them, she'd found her match.\n\n'Not just a vessel for their child'\n\nAfter some additional testing at the fertility center, Audrey and the couple began to iron out a legal contract.\n\nShe laid out what she was -- and wasn't -- comfortable with. She wanted to pick her own doctor and hospital. No more than two embryos could be implanted in her, she said, and she was relieved when they decided to go with just one. She planned to work with a doula, did not want an epidural and would consider a cesarean section only if the doctor deemed it necessary.\n\nEating healthy foods and not smoking were conditions she already chose to live by. And she and her husband would abstain from sexual intercourse in the weeks right before and after the embryo transfer, to make sure she was having Taroli and Li's baby -- not hers.\n\nFor many people, in vitro fertilization requires repeated tries -- and additional costs -- to work, if it works at all. The first embryo implanted in Audrey took without a hitch.\n\nShe, Taroli and Li were in touch by email a few times a week, and the dads came along to some of her doctor appointments. They got together at least once a month and came to know each other as her belly grew. Sometimes when they'd visit, the two men would take her and her family out to dinner.\n\n\"They really valued me,\" Audrey said. \"They saw me as a person, not just a vessel for their child.\"\n\nShe recalled how her own child took the developments in stride. When he was nearly 4 and she was very pregnant, someone asked her son, \"Aren't you excited you're going to be a brother?\"\n\nThe young boy answered, without skipping a beat, \"That's not going to be my brother. That's Bill and Yang's baby.\"\n\nAs her contractions grew stronger in the Redding delivery room, she held off on pushing and screamed out, \"Are the dads here? Are they here?\" A nurse rushed Taroli and Li in from the waiting room. They were there to witness Henry's arrival and cut his umbilical cord.\n\nAudrey and her husband, who was also in the room, watched as the two new dads fussed with how to put on the first diaper.\n\n\"They were so funny,\" Audrey, now 36, remembered. \"They were being a little snippy with each other. I'm sure I was like that with my son, and it was so cute to see that in someone else.\"\n\nAudrey pumped breast milk for Henry for 10 months and stopped sending the UPS shipments on dry ice only once Taroli and Li had enough to get them through their son's first year.\n\nShe and her family visited Henry's family quite a bit in the beginning. They saw them on Christmas and were at the boy's first birthday party. They've since moved to Los Angeles, where Audrey works as a speech therapist. It's been a couple years since they've seen each other, but they still get updates and pictures.\n\n'He's not my son'\n\nIsabelle and Audrey have not met but have heard about each other. They each received photo books Taroli and Li created to document Henry's first year and how he came into this world. They receive updates and additional photographs, still. And, as a result, they've seen pictures of one another, as they're both central to Henry's story.\n\nIsabelle remembers being a little thrown by the first photograph she spotted of Audrey.\n\n\"I remember thinking, she had my egg inside of her,\" she said. \"That's just crazy.\"\n\nIsabelle didn't see Taroli and Li again until Henry was about a 1\u00bd. The couple reached out to the clinic to say they wanted her to meet Henry.\n\n\"I wanted him to have the opportunity to know who was involved in his coming into being,\" said Taroli, who didn't learn that he was adopted until he was 14.\n\nThe clinic, in turn, put the query to Isabelle. She was living in the UK at the time but would be returning to California for Christmas.\n\nIsabelle's mother, who had opposed her daughter's decision to donate eggs, suddenly couldn't wait for her chance to meet the boy.\n\nThat would come later. The first visit with Taroli, Li and Henry was Isabelle's alone.\n\nAs she drove across the Golden Gate Bridge, she began to grow nervous. She was fresh off a breakup, emotionally raw and worried that she might see Henry and suddenly want him. She feared that she'd lay eyes on him and believe, \"This is my baby,\" she said.\n\n\"But then, when I got there and I saw Henry, he couldn't have cared less,\" she said with a laugh. \"I was just another person in the room. Yes, he's genetically my son, but he's not my son. He was more interested in the tissue box than me.\"\n\nShe tries to see them whenever she's in California and appreciates the photos they send her. Her mother gushes over pictures of Henry and \"is probably more attached to him than I am,\" Isabelle said.\n\nSometimes she wonders, if Taroli and Li had had a girl, whether she would have seen herself more in the child. She knew that there was a female embryo in the tank and thought about what might come later.\n\nTaroli and Li told her, at one point, that if she ever found herself single or struggling to get pregnant, she was welcome to use embryos they didn't use.\n\n\"It would be quite ironic, wouldn't it?\" asked Isabelle, who faces years of continued medical training and hopes to be an obstetrician-gynecologist some day. The option of using their embryos, if she needed them someday, stayed in the back of her mind.\n\nAn ocean between them\n\nTaroli was texting with his mom, with his television on in the background, when a national story caught his eye. He recognized the lobby of the Pacific Fertility Clinic but thought it was just generic footage, he said, to complement a report on a failed fertility clinic storage tank in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nHe had to rewind and watch the piece three or four times before the truth sunk in. The very same weekend that Cleveland experienced a tank malfunction, so did San Francisco.\n\nHe fired off an email to the fertility clinic, not knowing whether this freezer failure affected them. Li, who is establishing a new business in China, was abroad, so Taroli sent him a message, too, with a link to the TV segment.\n\nA day or two later, Taroli said, he got a late evening call from the clinic, confirming that their embryos were in the ill-fated tank. To find out whether the embryos were destroyed, however, would take further testing.\n\nTo test an embryo requires that it be thawed first, which -- in turn -- might damage the embryo, Taroli explained. He and Li decided they would approve testing, one embryo at a time. If the first was still OK, they could hope that the others were, too.\n\n\"So we did that,\" Taroli said over coffee in April. \"They all came back dead.\"\n\nWith thousands of miles and the Pacific Ocean between them, the couple processed what this meant for them.\n\n\"They were viable lives. They were potential babies, four boys and a girl, that if we chose to could have been our kids,\" Taroli said. \"It's not about the death of a child; it's not the same thing. ... It's the death of the possibility.\"\n\nAnd it's the death of what might have been for Henry, who'd lost the chance to have biological siblings.\n\nTaroli was playing the role of solo parent during Li's China trip. He got choked up when he spoke about their son, who recently turned 5, and the extra big hugs he was getting.\n\n\"If I get upset, he cries,\" Taroli said. \"I've been careful not to talk about it in front of him.\"\n\nBreaking the news\n\nIt was important to Taroli to break the news to Isabelle and Audrey. They were part of the fertility journey from the start, and they deserved to know how it ended.\n\nBefore he got to Isabelle, though, she got an email from the Pacific Fertility Clinic. The clinic wanted to know, out of the blue, whether she'd be open to donating eggs again. She explained where she now lived but said she'd be interested if they wanted to talk. She got a call almost immediately.\n\nIf the clinic wanted to fly her to California or could wait until she was there for a visit, she said, she'd be willing to go through a donation cycle, she said. She was told they'd reach out again if they needed her.\n\nThe exchange got her thinking about Henry and her experience. She talked to a friend about it that night and wondered aloud about how big Henry must be.\n\nWhen she woke up at 4 a.m., she said, she had an email from Taroli, telling her about the storage tank failure. She began to wonder whether the clinic had only called her because it had lost her eggs and their embryos. Taroli too found the timing odd. Why would they reach out to Isabelle without knowing whether he and Li were even interested in going through this again, he wondered.\n\nThe clinic, contacted several times for clarification on this and other questions, would not comment for this story.\n\nThe news of the lost embryos both shocked and saddened Isabelle.\n\n\"For some reason, I kept thinking about the little girl egg,\" she said, and the potential that was lost for all the embryos. \"They would never become people. But then, I guess, we always knew that they wouldn't all ever become real people, right?\"\n\nIsabelle told Taroli that if he and Li ever wanted to try again, her eggs were theirs.\n\nAudrey's heart sunk too for the couple when she got the news from Taroli. She knew from a previous conversation that they were on the fence about when -- or if -- they'd have a second child, but she hated that the option was taken away from them.\n\nBecause her experience with Taroli and Li was so wonderful, Audrey went on to be a gestational carrier once more a few years later. But the second time she did it for an opposite-sex couple, and the experience was awful in comparison. That couple demanded that doctors speak only to them and wanted to manage all aspects of her life. Audrey felt like nothing more than a vessel.\n\nAfter that, she said, she couldn't imagine being a surrogate again -- unless it was for Taroli and Li.\n\n\"They were so great, and I love them so much,\" Audrey said. \"I would do it a million times over again for them.\"\n\nTaroli and Li knew this.\n\n'Happy with where we are'\n\nPacific Fertility Center formally offered to cover all costs for another round, and their doctor, whom they don't blame in any way, was eager to have them go through the process again.\n\nBut Taroli and Li, after processing the shock, mourning the loss and coming to terms with where their lives are now, have decided they aren't interested in going through this again.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThey're getting older, they love their life with Henry, Li's new business in China will require lots of travel and time apart, and now is not the time for them to have more children.\n\nThe truth is, they may have never used those embryos, but they would have liked to make that decision on their own terms.\n\n\"If we were really eager to have a second child still or didn't have Henry yet, our thinking might have been different,\" Taroli said. \"We're happy with where we are.\"\n\nMeantime, attorneys are signing on clients for lawsuits against the clinic, but Taroli said they can't imagine dragging this out. They don't need to take part to find closure. Yes, they want to understand what went wrong with the tank that held their embryos, most of all because they want to be sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n\"I work in tech, where lives aren't on the line,\" Taroli said. \"You improve your process and put something better in place until the next thing you couldn't anticipate happens.\"\n\nHe doesn't judge those who are seeking legal remedies, and he knows that for some, for instance those who froze embryos before undergoing treatment for cancer, what happened is a tragedy of different proportions.\n\nBut for him and Li, they will love the child they do have, stay honest with Henry about where he came from and give him every chance to know the women who helped him get here.\n\nAnd someday, when the time is right and he asks why he never had siblings, they'll find the words to explain.",

    "text": "Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) Emmy Reeves shows off the My Little Pony mural she painted in her sister's room.\n\nShe points out other displays of her work around the family home: a portrait of a cat, a painting of a hillside overlooking Lake Superior, a small sculpture of her riding a wolf.\n\nAt 13, Emmy has undergone an awakening.\n\nJust months ago, she struggled with the rarest of conditions: She was a child with Type 1 diabetes who was allergic to the insulin shots she needed to stay alive.\n\nShe was given an array of antihistamines to dampen her allergic reactions as a means of survival. But the result was that she slept about 20 hours a day -- and the possibility of dying from her daily insulin remained.\n\nThe very medicine she needed to stay alive was slowly killing her.\n\n\"It's horrifying to know that every day, you would give your child a medicine that, in essence, could kill them,\" mother Tiffanie Reeves said. \"It's just really scary.\"\n\nFor Emmy, every insulin injection felt like fire spreading through her body, from her fingertips to her toes. When her parents tried to hug her, she'd flinch because the pain was unbearable.\n\nThe first time she was given an insulin shot, she stopped breathing, fainted and was rushed to the hospital. She was just 4 years old. In the months after, her parents held her down for every insulin shot. She'd scream and shout, \"I'll be a good girl!\"\n\n\"We have to do this because we love you. This is what keeps you alive,\" her parents would say.\n\nFor nine years, she suffered like this. Beyond the pain, she developed cataracts and often broke out into extreme rashes. She was medicated so much, she struggled with memory and an array of other issues.\n\nHer parents tried everything. They took Emmy to top medical institutions and spoke with insulin companies to get the least amount of preservatives in her insulin, because that's what they believed was causing the allergic reactions. Nothing seemed to work.\n\nDesperate, her father wrote an email last year to Dr. Raja Kandaswamy, one of the nation's pre-eminent pancreas transplant surgeons. \"Her quality of life is degrading faster than we had hoped, so now we are looking for a solution that will allow her to stop needing insulin, while we find a solution to her allergy,\" Jack Reeves wrote.\n\nMore than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy. For most children, the condition is managed through insulin injections and a close monitoring of their blood sugar levels. It is exceedingly rare for a child to have an insulin allergy on the magnitude as Emmy.\n\nEmmy's father wasn't looking for a cure for her diabetes. He was simply hoping to give his daughter an improved quality of life to help manage her diabetes. Her parents feared that she would die within a year if she stayed on the same course of treatment.\n\nEmmy Reeves holds her cat and a stuffed pancreas. She recently underwent a pancreas transplant that has transformed her life.\n\nBut that email set in motion a chain of events, resulting in the nation's sole pancreas transplant of a child this young in nearly 25 years. It also led to his daughter being cured of her diabetes.\n\n\"It's amazing. She's a totally different child,\" her mother said. \"Every day that she does not reject this organ, I'm going to hug her, even though she may get tired of Mommy hugging her.\"\n\n'You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling'\n\nKandaswamy, the director of the pancreas transplant program at University of Minnesota Health, remembers receiving the email from Emmy's father \"like it was yesterday.\"\n\nKandaswamy, who has two daughters himself, felt the pain of a father who desperately wanted help for his child. But there was little medical literature to guide or support a pancreatic transplant in a child. There have been other cases in which children receive a new pancreas, but those transplants are usually done in conjunction with kidney and intestine transplants.\n\nOnly nine children have received a sole pancreas transplant, Kandaswamy said. The last time a pancreas transplant was done in a child this young, he said, was nearly 25 years ago. That transplant was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1994 on an 11-year-old boy by Kandaswamy's mentor, Dr. David Sutherland, who is considered the father of pancreatic transplants. Unfortunately, that pancreas only lasted six months in the boy.\n\n\"Pancreas transplants are generally just not done on children,\" Kandaswamy said.\n\nBut his mentor taught him to always put a loved one in that patient's place and ask yourself, \" 'What would you do if it was your mother or your daughter who needed the care?' Ask that question, and you will get your answer.\"\n\nKandaswamy said that's exactly what he did when Emmy first visited. \"I have two daughters of my own. One of them is very close in age to Emmy,\" he said. \"Looking at her, you could see: 'Hey, if this was your daughter, what would you do?'\n\n\"You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling,\" said Kandaswamy, who is also a professor in the department of surgery at the university's medical school. \"Her quality of life was just deteriorating to the point that this was a cycle that would not be compatible for long-term survival.\"\n\nHe had to educate others in the hospital about why he felt the transplant would work for a child. The university had a new pediatric hospital, and if the surgery didn't go as planned, the institution's reputation could be adversely impacted.\n\n\"There was a huge amount of apprehension,\" Kandaswamy said. \"I knew we were taking a big risk in that this may not go well.\"\n\nA team of more than a dozen doctors was put together to study Emmy's case: surgeons, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, allergists, transplant coordinators, pain management specialists and others.\n\nAfter a four-day assessment in April 2017 at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, they agreed that a full pancreas transplant was the best option of giving her a better quality of life.\n\n\"We didn't make the decision without due thought and process,\" Kandaswamy said. \"We had to do it because of the extenuating circumstances here.\"\n\nKandaswamy felt that in the nearly 25 years since that first pancreas transplant on a child, the surgical techniques and post-transplant management have advanced to the point that his team could \"successfully perform a transplant in a child this young.\"\n\nA healthy pancreas would allow her body to naturally produce insulin -- effectively curing her diabetes -- but the surgery carried many risks, including the possibility her body would reject the organ.\n\n\"Pediatric patients, they have very active immune systems, and they will try to spit out any kind of organ,\" Kandaswamy said.\n\nEmmy and her mother would also need to move to Minnesota from South Carolina to be near the hospital the moment a pancreas became available.\n\nBefore she headed north, though, Emmy created a bucket list: eat jambalaya in Louisiana, feast on a steak in Texas, visit the Grand Canyon and see her friends from diabetes camp in California, where she once lived.\n\nThe family hit the road. Emmy got to do everything on her list.\n\nIt was, her parents say, a farewell trip, should she not survive.\n\nFalse alarms and the magic moment\n\nEmmy and her mother arrived in Minnesota on July 15. They settled into the Ronald McDonald House, where families stay for free during visits at the hospital. They then had to wait for a pancreas to become available.\n\nThree times, the calls came that an organ might be available. Each time turned out to be a false alarm. The second was on Thanksgiving.\n\nAt one low point, Emmy suffered a severe allergic reaction in January; she stopped breathing and had to be rushed into emergency care. Still, she battled on.\n\nThen came the moment. On the afternoon of February 9, Kandaswamy called Emmy's mother with news that a pancreas was available. Emmy was watching a documentary about wolves, her favorite animal, with her tutor at a museum.\n\nMom let her finish watching the film and then told her it was time. They needed to rush back, gather up some belongings and get to the hospital. When they got to the Ronald McDonald House, the place was abuzz. Word had spread like wildfire that Emmy's moment had arrived. Families and staff cheered them on and wished them well.\n\nAt the hospital, Kandaswamy greeted them in the lobby. He explained that a procurement team had gone to get the organ about an hour away in St. Cloud -- that there was still a possibility it might not be a proper fit but that he was optimistic.\n\nEmmy's mother, Tiffanie Reeves, clutched Ducky throughout the transplant. The stuffed animal was given to Emmy when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.\n\nEmmy was prepped for the surgery so she would be ready when the pancreas arrived.\n\nAbout 3 a.m., Kandaswamy conferenced in Jack, who was back in South Carolina with Emmy's younger sister. \"I think we are going to go ahead. The organ looks good,\" he said.\n\nOn Emmy's 210th day in Minnesota, the transplant began. That number isn't lost on the family: She was wheeled into the operating room on 2/10.\n\nAs Emmy underwent surgery, Mom clutched a tattered yellow stuffed animal named Ducky, who was given to Emmy after she was diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nThe surgery took more than four hours. \"It was a great, great feeling when we got her done,\" Kandaswamy said. \"But I knew in my mind that the job was only half done. We were excited but also cautiously optimistic at that point.\"\n\nThe doctors had to make sure the new pancreas -- what Emmy nicknamed \"Player 2\" -- worked properly, that her body didn't reject it and that her body could tolerate the immunosuppressive drugs she needed after the transplant.\n\nShe responded well the first week, but in the second week after the transplant, her body began to reject the organ. Her immune system saw it as foreign and tried to attack it.\n\n\"I had to come and tell her that her body is in rejection,\" her mother said. \"We're not sure what's going to happen in the future.\"\n\nThey decided to try a stronger immunosuppressant. \"We're already down the rabbit hole, Mom. We gotta do what we gotta do,\" Emmy said.\n\nEver since, her pancreas has functioned as hoped.\n\nDr. Melina Bellin, the pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health who worked with Emmy, said it was \"touch-and-go\" early on, but everyone was relieved when Emmy's health turned around.\n\n\"It's particularly rewarding when you're at that point in the beginning when you're not 100% sure it's going to turn out the way you wanted,\" she said. \"It definitely makes it that much better when it does.\"\n\nKandaswamy added, \"We were able to treat it effectively and got it turned around.\"\n\nWith the healthy new pancreas, he said, her diabetes has been cured. She no longer needs insulin shots or the antihistamines that she was taking to try to limit her allergic reactions. The hospital slowly weaned her off all of those medications that were making her extremely drowsy and \"blunting her consciousness,\" Kandaswamy said.\n\n\"Then we saw the real Emmy. She started really blossoming,\" he said. \"It's like a cloud has been lifted off her consciousness so she can actually express all of this stuff in a big way.\"\n\nOne of the greatest moments of his career, Kandaswamy said, was when Emmy hugged him: \"There was nothing more fulfilling than seeing her walk up, give me a hug and say, 'I want to go back home.' It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nPancreas transplants are not recommended for most children with diabetes, but Kandaswamy said he hopes this case will open the way for children with rare conditions like Emmy who could benefit from a pancreas transplant. \"I think this will be an index case that will help spark that awareness,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking up to help others\n\nIn the family home in Columbia, South Carolina, Jack and Tiffanie Reeves are still in near disbelief at how well Emmy is doing. She's thriving in ways they could only dream of. Beyond her artwork, she's started playing the piano. She can go on hikes. She can shoot hoops. She can play with her younger sister, Abby.\n\nEmmy Reeves shows off the mural she painted in her sister's room after her transplant.\n\n\"She's getting a childhood, finally. She's getting to be able to be a kid,\" her mother said. \"I mean, this child's achieved so much in just the three months since transplant. It's going to be pretty incredible to get to see what she'll be able to do in the next few years.\"\n\nThe family agreed to tell Emmy's story in hopes that it can help other children suffering as she did. They know of four young children around the world with a similar insulin allergy as she.\n\n\"If our experience could help even one kid, I think it would be worth it,\" Tiffanie said.\n\nEmmy is not out of the woods. The first year after a transplant is especially critical. Her body could still reject the organ. The family tries not to dwell on that. \"We still live life, and we don't let the worry and stress of that keep us and our daughters from living the life that we need to,\" her father said.\n\nEmmy hopes to be a zoologist one day.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFor now, she's shy around CNN's camera and doesn't want to talk with cameras rolling. When they're off, she stands next to a window overlooking her backyard and a decaying swing set.\n\nShe says she's drawn sketches of what she envisions back there: a greenhouse, a new swing set, a fire pit and a fence.\n\nWhen the Make-A-Wish Foundation reached out, she told them she didn't want to travel anywhere fancy or meet a famous star.

    "text": "Petros, Tennessee (CNN) Fifty years ago, a career criminal named James Earl Ray traveled from Atlanta to Memphis, stalking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader was there to energize a strike of sanitation workers asking for better working conditions and higher pay. Ray was there to assassinate him.\n\nWhile King stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel (now a museum for peace), Ray accomplished his sinister goal with a single shot from more than 200 feet away.\n\nOver the next two months, while on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List, Ray was on the run, traveling to Europe on a false passport. He was eventually caught at London's Heathrow Airport. He pleaded guilty to avoid a jury trial and the death penalty, was sentenced to 99 years and sent to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in eastern Tennessee, surrounded by thick wooded hills.\n\nIn its day, it was considered one of the toughest state prisons, where inmates frequently killed each other. In the novel \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" Dr. Hannibal Lecter negotiates a transfer to the prison.\n\nBrushy was also nearly impossible to escape, but Ray managed it with the help of six other convicts in 1977. All were recaptured within days, though \"rescued\" is probably the better description. Cold, hunger and disorientation brought them to their knees, and their own fiction-worthy plot turned from \"The Great Escape\" to \"Blair Witch Project.\"\n\nRay himself traveled only 8 miles in a little over two days, a detail that made one local long-distance runner, Gary Cantrell, think to himself that he could make it 100 miles in that amount of time.\n\nAnd thus the seed of the Barkley Marathons was planted.\n\nMan vs. land\n\nCantrell, whose nickname is \"Lazarus Lake,\" or \"Laz\" as he is known by everyone, was further inspired to start his own race by this rugged land he knew so well. The name \"brushy\" is fitting for a rural area thick with undergrowth, briars and hidden obstacles that inflict cuts, bruises and falls. It's so dense, you can't see the top of any of the peaks from the bottom.\n\nThese mountains, where a day hike can be a challenge, are where truly competitive racing should be held, he thought, not on a flat, paved, well-marked course.\n\nThe Barkley consists of five loops of 20 miles each (though runners swear it's more like a marathon-length 26 miles). All told, it has about 67,000 feet of elevation -- from sea level to the peak of Mount Everest is 29,000 feet -- not that the other 67,000 feet of descent are much easier.\n\nPhotos: The world's hardest ultramarathon The Barkley Marathons consists of five loops, 20 miles each, along unmarked trails in rural Tennessee, with about 67,000 feet of elevation.

Runners must trace the course from a topographical map hours before the race begins. Most other distance races -- with their clear routes, aid stations, teams of helpful volunteers and throngs of encouraging spectators -- are designed so racers finish, but the Barkley is designed so racers fail.\n\nAnd fail they do. Of more than 1,000 who've entered, only 15 have completed the full distance in time. \"It's a good place for your ego to take a beating,\" Laz said before this year's race, sporting a red beanie labeled \"Geezer.\" His insightful quips are often followed by a cackle of delight, like the Yoda of the runner's world.\n\nAmong ultramarathoners, the Barkley is considered one of the hardest -- a superlative that is subjective, of course. There are footraces that cross deserts, traverse tall mountains and even go greater distances than Barkley's 100 or 130 or so miles. But it's the unique combination of impediments, punishing conditions and lack of assistance that makes this race the stuff of legend. It's even the subject of a documentary; a cameraman had to be rescued by rangers more than 12 hours after he got lost.\n\nIt's only in the face of such opposition that the highest peak physical and mental experiences are achieved. That's the idea, anyway. Among ultramarathoners and elite trail runners, the Barkley is the Holy Grail of races.\n\nHow it works (or doesn't)\n\nFor a competition that thumbs its nose at conventional rules, this anti-race race does have a number of parameters in which it operates (not written down, of course), all to maximize the challenge. Some of the choice unwritten rules include:\n\nNo GPS or phones. The only permitted technology is a cheap watch from Walmart, handed out by Laz to each runner and synchronized to his watch.\n\nThe only permitted technology is a cheap watch from Walmart, handed out by Laz to each runner and synchronized to his watch.

Other ultras charge hundreds of dollars, but Laz isn't in it for the money, though he's partial to a specific brand of dress sock.\n\nThousands apply every year, and only 40 are chosen. Just figuring out how to apply is a challenge: There's no website, email or physical address posted anywhere.\n\nLaz, as he is known by everyone, was inspired to create the Barkley Marathons by the local land and a prison escape by Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassin.\n\nWould-be runners write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete, and Laz chooses among these, factoring in their arguments or, in some cases, poetry but also their proven ability to endure. Finishers tend to have bona fides that include setting speed records on famous long-distance national trails or climbing the highest peaks in the world. If accepted, runners get a \"letter of condolence\" and told the date of the race (also a secret), and they must bring a license plate of some variety to the race site that are strung up in walls of metallic memory.\n\n'Good luck, morons'\n\nThis year's lucky (or maybe unlucky) runners -- 31 men, nine women -- gathered on a chilly April evening at a campground at Frozen Head State Park the day before the race. A single copy of the course map sat on a table as runners took turns tracing the route on their own topographical maps. The route changes in parts from year to year, and sometimes a peak is added. Veterans know to laminate them in clear tape to avoid disintegration from the elements.\n\nFour or five pages of Laz's enigmatic and wry instructions are also handed out. These mainly help runners find the checkpoint books, which often have tongue-in-cheek titles such as \"Where Do We Go From Here\" and \"A Time to Die.\" I asked one runner whether I could take a quick look at the instructions, and he seemed wary of handing over such well-kept secrets to a representative of a global media organization. One (non-identifiable) passage read, \"You will be able to make out the trail that climbs directly to pulloff, unless it is foggy, then you will have to guess.\"\n\nChicken and beans, cooked over an open fire, were served as part of a potluck the evening before the race started. There is little to no alcohol, as that's not conducive to running 100-plus miles. Runners greet each other warmly and exchange war stories of past Barkleys. It's a rarified club to which they belong. A cake read, \"Good luck, morons.\"\n\nBecause you don't know when the race is going to start, it makes for a fitful night's sleep, lest you miss the sound of the conch. This sleep-depriving FOMO was exacerbated by the cacophony of heavy rain pounding on the tents most of the night.\n\nMercifully, or just randomly, Laz gave everyone a full night of whatever sleep they could get, and the conch was blown at 8:30 a.m., under clear skies. When runners gathered an hour later to start, Laz gave few remarks, none particularly encouraging. After reading the names of Barkley veterans who died over the years, Laz removed his hat, and a bugler played taps, the traditional song of military funerals.\n\nTradition dictates that the start of the race is signaled by Laz lighting a Camel cigarette. Runners started trotting past him as he made his first exhale. The course begins with a steady incline that will reach 1,600 feet of elevation within just the first mile and a half or, as Laz described it, \"the easiest hill they'll do all day. After that, it turns ugly.\"\n\nAlthough he's done his fair share of endurance running (including a 318-mile course) and long-distance hiking (he's currently walking from Tennessee to Oregon), Laz has never competed in the Barkley himself. Neither has his friend Barry Barkley, for whom he named the race.\n\n'4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell'\n\nThe details of the race are a well-guarded secret, and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road, Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map.\n\nThe one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail, emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.\n\nThe race takes place every spring, a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years, there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing.\n\n\"This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog,\" Laz said, pausing for his punch line: \"at the same time.\" This year, it started pleasantly cool and cloudy, but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.\n\nBetween each loop, runners will eat, doctor their feet, maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes, others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well, adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops, two are clockwise, two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop, each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.\n\nNo one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop, five made it to the third loop, and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out, a bugler played taps. Like some previous years, it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.\n\nFinishing is so rare, there is a web page of quotes on what the experience was like. Brett Maune, 2011's only finisher, calculated \"4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell.\"\n\nAndrew Thompson finished in 2009, after setting the speed record for the 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47\u00bd days. \"Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected,\" he wrote. \"All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick, and cold, and damn happy to be done.\"\n\nOnly one person, Jared Campbell, has finished the race three times. \"I am thrilled,\" he said after finishing in 2016, \"setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60.\" In 2014, he was more philosophical: \"There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal, comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life.\" And in 2012, he was nearly psychedelic: \"Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts, which was both an educational and beautiful experience.\"\n\nIn 2013, finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: \"The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.\"\n\n'A different breed'\n\nTo reach the Barkley, you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual \"human sacrifice,\" as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.\n\nBut if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing, you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals, also known as periodization, building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.\n\nIn the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races, it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map, something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.\n\nUnlike the documentary crew member and King's killer, no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: \"100% self-extraction\") that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia.\n\nAlthough GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley, plenty of other gear is, including compasses, walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality, thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons, this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.\n\nTraining in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries, but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley, but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that \"snapped in two,\" Laz said, and the runner still finished the loop. \"It's a different breed,\" he cackled.\n\nthough some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures. Ultrarunners suffer about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners, according to a recent study by the University of California, Davis and Stanford University,though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThat study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population, they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies, hay fever and exercise-induced asthma, probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general, running is outstanding cardio exercise, benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.\n\nAs for the mental rewards -- well, that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A \"sense of accomplishment\" is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley. And yet to get to whatever personal heaven awaits you at the finish line, it most certainly means going through hell to get there.",

But a microwave ablation surgery last year to remove two tumors from her liver went terribly wrong, leaving a fist-sized hole in her liver and destroying her bile ducts.\n\nEvery day since has been a fight to survive. She's been hospitalized 19 times in Oregon over the last 12 months for infections, bleeding and an array of other health issues.\n\nShe has high blood pressure in her liver, which backs up the veins in her esophagus and can be catastrophic. Her surgical oncologist constantly worries she will fall ill with a bad infection and die.\n\nWithout a liver transplant, her doctors say Erika will likely die before the end of the year.\n\n\"Every time she calls me and has a fever and some bleeding, we all hold our breath, worried: Will this be the time Erika bleeds to death?\" says Dr. Skye Mayo, her surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\"This is kind of the end game of what liver failure looks like.\"\n\nMore than 100 doctors at three of the nation's top medical centers have weighed in on her case, which is complex and exceedingly rare. Their conclusion: The only way to save Erika's life is to give her a new liver.\n\nAfter weeks of evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in December and January, Erika finally got her big break.\n\nOn February 2, doctors there approved putting her on the wait list for a liver transplant.\n\nThe news changed everything. Erika finally had hope. Around the house, 4-year-old Lo\u00efe would say, \"Mommy, when you get a new liver, can you push me in the swing?\"\n\nBut Erika hit an immediate wall. Her insurer, UnitedHealthcare, denied coverage for the transplant, saying it would not be a \"promising treatment.\" She appealed and was rejected again.\n\nThe mom who desperately wanted to live looked into Oregon's Death with Dignity program. Erika had written a letter to her daughter months ago to be read after she died. Now she worried Lo\u00efe might receive it sooner than Mom had planned:\n\nDear Lo\u00efe,\n\nIf you're reading this, I'm probably not on this earth anymore. So please remember this:\n\nI am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair. I am with you when you look up to the sky and see tiny birds flying free or the stars twinkling in your eyes. I am with you when you feel a perfect, warm breeze upon your sweet face.\n\nErika wasn't going to give up. Her little girl with bright blue eyes was a constant reminder of all that is precious.\n\nOutraged and heartbroken, Erika wrote a four-page letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare (UHC), giving him a piece of her mind about what she felt was a rigged review process, riddled with errors, that determined her life wasn't worth saving.\n\nWeeks passed until the company reached a decision. Despite her plea, the answer was the same: Denied.\n\nThen, last week, an amazing thing happened.\n\nErika Zak and her husband, Scott Powers, lock hands during a recent hospital visit. The two met 20 years ago.\n\n'My life hangs in the balance'\n\nIf it's true that opening your heart, revealing your feelings, unleashes freedom and makes you whole, Erika turned to one of the things she loves most in an effort to save her life. Writing.\n\nIt was early April. She sat at her computer, her keyboard clacking. She wasn't going to leave her husband, Scott Powers, and their daughter Lo\u00efe behind without trying her damnedest to stay on this Earth for as long as possible.\n\nThere was too much at stake.\n\nUnitedHealthcare had overruled her treating physicians and denied the transplant, saying \"unproven health services is not a covered benefit.\" The words burned, like chemo. Her first appeal went nowhere, and she felt trapped in a labyrinth of red tape.\n\nThe young mother -- frail from having lost 20 pounds in the past year, her skin and eyes yellow from jaundice -- felt the only way to get a new liver was to plead her case directly to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann.\n\nHer frame may be tiny, but don't mistake that for weakness. She is one of the strongest women you will ever meet.\n\nAs she typed, Erika bared her soul. Of longing to live. Of seeing her daughter grow up. Of the need for \"my only option,\" a liver transplant.\n\n\"Given that my life hangs in the balance based on this review,\" she wrote, \"it is unconscionable that it has not been undertaken with the level of competence and professionalism anyone would expect of UHC.\"\n\nShe blasted what she called the \"shockingly incompetent manner\" in which the country's largest insurance company handled her case. She outlined what she described as a series of errors made in the review process -- ranging from UHC saying her liver failure stems from \"chemotherapy toxicity\" to an insurance medical director who erroneously said she had \"life-threatening lesions.\"\n\n\"Neither are true,\" she wrote Wichmann. \"(UHC's) handling of my case has been plagued by unnecessary delays, incomplete responses, inept scheduling, contradictory statements, and worst of all repeated factual errors regarding my medical history.\n\n\"Most importantly, decisions based on inaccurate information and analysis have already delayed my listing and transplant two months.\"\n\nLoie has been with her mother throughout the process. Erika calls her \"my tiniest, most amazing companion.\"\n\nOne review doctor noted she had a \"9cm tumor\" in her liver, she wrote, apparently unaware that was actually the hole from the ablation surgery resulting in her chronic liver failure.\n\n\"I have been doing every single thing I possibly can do to stay alive for these past four years, scratching and clawing by day and praying every night an opportunity like this would come along,\" Erika wrote. \"Now, when the promise of my long-term survival is actually greatest, I need UHC's support more than ever.\"\n\nShe sent the letter via FedEx on April 11.\n\nHer concerns were valid. Her transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic made clear to UHC's appeals unit the primary cause of her liver failure was not from chemo toxicity or cancer, but instead was the result of \"a consequence of complications following microwave ablation.\"\n\n\"Of note, what mainly drives the indication of liver transplantation in this case is liver failure and NOT liver metastases from colorectal cancer, which makes the patient's post-transplant oncologic outcome more encouraging,\" wrote Dr. Federico Aucejo, the director of the Cleveland Clinic's Liver Cancer Program, in an appeal on Erika's behalf on March 6. He did note that she had some chemotoxicity, which was a secondary cause of liver failure.\n\n\"The opinion of the experienced Cleveland Clinic multidisciplinary liver transplant committee (is) that liver transplantation would prolong this young patient's life substantially, and that there is NO other treatment alternative that could match this outcome at this point in time.\"\n\nTwo days after sending her letter, Erika and her husband were told the UHC executive team had received it and that her case was undergoing further review.\n\nSeveral times, the family said it was told a decision would be made by a certain date; those dates came and went without a decision.\n\nAs time wore on, Erika grew ill with a high fever and was hospitalized for several days. It was the fifth time she'd been admitted since February 2, the day Cleveland Clinic doctors approved her for a transplant.\n\nOn Instagram, she posted an illustration with the words \"waiting, waiting, waiting\" on a pink backdrop with black crosses.\n\n\"Waiting for insurance to approve the only thing that will save me: a liver,\" she wrote. \"Waiting for my liver to fail completely; waiting to die. Waiting to be saved.\"\n\nErika has undergone multiple surgeries and faced more than 70 rounds of chemotherapy.\n\n'Wait or die'\n\nMore than 100,000 Americans are on wait lists for organ transplants, and every hour someone dies while waiting for the life-saving surgery, said Dr. Andrew Cameron, the chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins and the surgical director of its liver transplant program.\n\nFor liver transplants, 20,000 Americans are on the wait list and only 7,000 will receive a new liver in 2018, according to Cameron, who is not connected to Erika's case.\n\n\"The lucky few undergo a transformative life-saving procedure,\" he said. \"Those who don't get that lottery ticket wait or die.\"\n\nTransplant teams at hospitals spend hours upon hours -- months even -- assessing and debating whether a patient is a good candidate for a transplant, Cameron said, typically with more than a dozen doctors weighing in.\n\nIt is deeply disturbing, he said, when an insurance company overrules the \"decision made by a thoughtful, careful transplant team to utilize one of society's limited resources -- that precious gift to save somebody's life.\"\n\nThe negotiated cost for a liver transplant for an insurance company is roughly $200,000, Cameron said, adding it is \"exceedingly rare\" for an insurer to deny a transplant.\n\n\"That is highly unusual and highly undesirable,\" Cameron told CNN.\n\nIn Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo is trailblazing the field for patients like Erika, having performed the only two transplants in America this century on people suffering from what is called unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer.\n\nIt's groundbreaking and could prove transformative.\n\n\"I hope that we can achieve good results and set precedent,\" he said.\n\nDr. Skye Mayo, a surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University, has treated Erika Zak since 2015.\n\nWhen you're trying such a new approach, Dr. Aucejo said, it can be difficult getting insurers to agree to treatment and he wished getting them aboard could be done \"in a more expeditious way.\"\n\nHe explained that in the late 1980s and 1990s, surgeons tried transplants on patients like Erika with \"unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer,\" but the \"outcomes were not good.\"\n\nOnly 18% of the patients lived past five years, so the transplants were stopped, Dr. Aucejo said. But, he emphasized, most of the bad outcomes were the result of technical complications and post-transplant management, not from the cancer returning. The field of transplants has greatly improved in the decades since, he said.\n\nDoctors in Europe, primarily in Norway, have begun changing the field, he said, finding that about 50-60% of patients with Erika's condition survive a transplant past five years.\n\nThat is a substantial difference, he said.\n\nDr. Mayo, Erika's surgical oncologist in Oregon, said no one at the insurance company reached out to him during the review process \"to help explain the facts of her case.\"\n\nThat is troubling, he said, especially when it's one of the most complicated cases a doctor will ever see.\n\n\"It is frustrating when it seems that the facts aren't all being considered,\" Dr. Mayo said.\n\n\"Her life now is not limited by her cancer,\" he said. \"It's limited by the fact she will go into liver failure and die within the next several months if she doesn't have a liver transplant.\"\n\nErika wrote a note for her daughter if she does not survive: \"I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair.\"\n\nWhen opposites attract\n\nErika was in the prime of her life. At 34, she'd given birth to her first and only child, Lo\u00efe, the little girl who Mom calls \"my tiniest, most amazing companion.\"\n\nShe'd been married to the love of her life for four years. She and Scott met in 1998 when he was at Brown University and she was at the Rhode Island School of Design, both in Providence.\n\nThe two were polar opposites. He was the MVP of Brown's soccer team and majored in economics. She was into the arts and majored in textile design. He was from the tightly wound East Coast, she from the free-wheeling West Coast.\n\nThe connection wasn't immediate, so Erika had a mutual friend slip a tiny drawing to Scott. It contained her phone number; he called it.\n\nSoon they clicked. Scott made her laugh and feel beautiful. Erika saw in him someone who was kind and devoted; in her, he found the woman who he'd always searched for, with a captivating sense of humor and a sailor's mouth.\n\nThey tied the knot on Halloween in 2009 in the wine country of Healdsburg, California.\n\nHer career was taking off, too. She was working for Old Navy, choosing and designing the fabrics, prints and plaids for the company's baby and toddler division. While she was pregnant, she was promoted to senior textile designer.\n\n\"It was all coming together,\" she wrote on her blog. \"And then, like that, my foundation crumbled.\"\n\nDuring the final trimester of her pregnancy, she'd experienced pain in her stomach. It was thought to be nothing more than part of the difficulties of pregnancy. But in the weeks after delivery, the pain grew excruciating and she felt a lump on her side.\n\nOn April 8, 2014, she received the awful news -- that she had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her daughter was just 3 months old.\n\n\"Worst Day Ever\" read the headline of her blog.\n\nShe had survived cancer once before. At 28, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her thyroid was removed, and life continued as normal. It was nothing close to a stage 4 diagnosis.\n\nIn the years after her colon cancer diagnosis, she blogged about most everything. Of losing her father to Alzheimer's at age 83. Of the pain over two friends' deaths -- including an oncologist she'd met in a cancer support group.\n\n\"Have you ever cried and screamed so hard that the blood vessels around your eyes burst?\" she wrote.\n\nIn her blog posts, she was brutally honest about her cancer and the effects of chemotherapy.\n\nErika and Scott Powers met in college while they were both in school in Rhode Island.\n\nShe'd sit on the shower floor in a fetal position, screaming and sobbing. It was \"anguish and pain and longing for my former life and utter disbelief for the war my body was waging on itself,\" she blogged.\n\nHer fingertips felt like they had been \"burned on a hot pan most of the time.\" Her hands cramped into weird, contorted positions. Her hair was dry and brittle, like straw. Her energy was so drained she felt twice her age.\n\nAs a teen, she'd suffered debilitating depression and anxiety that was so bad at times, she said, \"I hoped that I could just disappear forever.\"\n\n\"It's funny how afraid I am of that now: disappearing. How much I want to live. How important it feels to be here,\" she wrote on December 1, 2016, two and half years into her cancer battle.\n\nShe would face multiple surgeries and undergo more than 70 rounds of chemo. On February 28, 2017, she wrote:\n\n\"This is chemo day. Scream in your pillow day. Hide in the shower day. Lie to your baby day. Tell her you're going to work day. Vials and vials of blood day. Tell your doctor you're angry day. Make your husband cry day. Poison your body day.\"\n\nOn another day, she penned: \"Cancer is a slow form of torture. It strips you of dignity; of peace of mind; of stability.\"\n\nOn April 4, 2017, nearly three years to the day of her diagnosis, she and her daughter had a soul-crushing conversation. The cancer had been eradicated from her colon shortly after the diagnosis, but it remained in her liver.\n\n\"Mommy, are you going to last?\" Lo\u00efe asked.\n\n\"What do you mean, Lo\u00efe?\"\n\n\"Will you be here forever and ever?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"I really don't know, babe.\"\n\nAs she awaited word from her insurer about the transplant, Erika said, \"I'm mad and grouchy, but I still feel like I have a fighting chance.\"\n\nSix days later, Erika underwent the ablation surgery at a facility in New York to target two small tumors on her liver. Something went wrong. She ended up with the hole in her liver.\n\nTo save her life, surgeons had to block off the veins and arteries going to her liver. The entire central part of her liver died, Dr. Mayo said. Two bags are now attached to her abdomen to drain the bile.\n\nWith bile going immediately outside her body, instead of through the liver and her body, Erika was susceptible to extreme sickness and potential fatal bleeds.\n\n\"All of those things culminated in what is now liver failure for her,\" Dr. Mayo said. \"She's in this cycle right now where she's losing on a daily basis some of her body's most vital fluids.\"\n\nThe cancer in her liver, meanwhile, was progressing on a path, he said, where \"she would die of cancer.\" She could no longer tolerate any standard form of chemo treatment.\n\nHer doctors in Oregon last fall tried one last treatment to fend off her cancer: a groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer drug called pembrolizumab, known by its brand name Keytruda.\n\nHer sky-high tumor marker levels fell to normal. \"She had an incredible response to this new drug,\" Dr. Mayo said. \"I think all of the cancer remaining in her body is dead at this point. What she will die of is liver failure.\"\n\nWith a new liver, he said, her problems with bleeding and high blood pressure could be resolved. Her jaundice would be gone, too.\n\nBut transplant surgery is not without major risks.\n\nMost of those who've received a transplant with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer, Cleveland's Dr. Aucejo said, experience a recurrence of cancer within 12 months.\n\nMost of the cancers that return can be treated with standard care, like chemotherapy or surgery, he said, profoundly prolonging their lives.\n\nFor a small subset of patients, though, the cancer comes back aggressively and it's not treatable with chemo or surgery, he said. \"Unfortunately in that subset of patients, the survival is more dismal.\"\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict the outcome, he said, Erika shows \"features that may do well.\" There's no evidence cancer has spread beyond her liver, he said.\n\nPlus, patients who had their colon cancer removed two years or more before the transplant, Dr. Aucejo said, tend do well. Erika had the cancerous portion of her colon removed in 2014: \"That's a good indicator.\"\n\nDr. Aucejo also emphasized the criteria for transplant qualification is stringent and that Erika shows promise.\n\n\"We're talking about distributing limited organs,\" he said. \"Again, we have to be very careful that we're not giving organs to people who are not going to benefit from it when there's people dying with standard indications because there's not enough organs.\"\n\nErika Zak comes to the hospital every three weeks for a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug. Her doctors says that without it, she would have died of cancer.\n\n'This is so messed up'\n\nIn the days and weeks after Erika fired off her letter to the CEO, her husband, Scott, worked the phones.\n\nHe felt lost in an endless loop of delays and broken promises as to when the insurer would reach its decision.\n\nFinally, they were told a decision would come May 2.\n\nErika couldn't sleep the night before. She pulled out her phone and recorded a message, weeping for much of the video.\n\n\"My life is literally in their hands, and every day I feel myself kind of fading away more and more,\" she says. \"I don't want to leave. I don't want to die.\"\n\nThe next day came. Each minute crept by.\n\nShortly after 2 p.m., Scott's phone rang.\n\nIt was their point of contact with UnitedHealthcare.\n\nHe had crushing news: Denied.\n\nHe explained Erika's case was sent back to the three reviewing doctors. One of them, he said, \"changed his decision from 'not promising' to 'promising.'\"\n\nHowever, the other two doctors ruled the transplant not to be promising: \"The bottom line is they're upholding that decision.\"\n\nThe doctor who sided in favor of the transplant, their UHC contact told them, was the only one of the three who talked directly with her transplant surgeon.\n\nScott grew furious. \"Honestly, you know that is messed up,\" he said. \"I don't know who you've got to go to, but I would go to someone now and have someone call us, because this is so messed up.\"\n\nScott Powers has advocated for his wife since she was first diagnosed with cancer.\n\nScott pressed for more information. He got little.\n\n\"Scott, I know what you've been through,\" the UHC rep told him. \"I know what you're going through.\"\n\nErika sat silently for the first 10 minutes of the conservation, absorbing the news and what it meant for her fate. But at those words, it was time to speak up.\n\n\"Hey!\" she shouted. \"This is Erika, and you've never heard from me before. You don't know what we're going through. Because I'm dying.\"\n\nThrough tears, she said, \"I need a liver transplant, and I need it now.\"\n\nThe UHC rep confided he \"was not hoping for this outcome. I was hoping that I'd have good news.\"\n\nHe suggested Erika and Scott fax over any new information they thought might be relevant. He also acknowledged the delays in recent weeks were not in keeping with the company's policies.\n\n\"Someone needs to be accountable for this,\" he said. \"You know, why, when we have these guidelines in place, did we not follow them?\n\n\"That needs to be looked into,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not trying to sweep anything under the rug.\"\n\nHe apologized for having to be the bearer of bad news, saying his goal had been to end the day on a positive note.\n\n\"Like I said, I wish I had better news.\"\n\nAfter more than 30 minutes, he ended with: \"Have a good night, OK.\"\n\nNot the words the couple wanted to hear.\n\nErika went numb. Heartbroken and angry didn't even begin to describe her feelings.\n\nScott felt equally distraught. \"I just want her to get a liver,\" he said. \"She deserves that.\"\n\nThe CEO never responded -- not by email, phone or letter.\n\nErika Zak says her will to live is motivated by her daughter, Lo\u00efe. Here, they play on the couch as the family dog, Maddie, watches.\n\nA sudden change\n\nFive days later, on Monday, May 7, a surprise call came. Erika and Scott were preparing Lo\u00efe for school when Scott's phone rang.\n\nThey had spent the weekend trying to figure out their next move, while trying not to focus too much on when Erika might need Death with Dignity. They knew they had one appeal left, and they didn't want to blow it.\n\nThey hadn't sent any new information since the last call.\n\nIt was their UHC rep on the phone. This time, he had good news: The insurer would cover Erika's transplant.\n\nWhen Scott heard she'd been approved, he jumped up and down. Erika watched him from across the room.\n\nThere was no explanation for the change. They were told to focus on Erika's health and next steps.\n\nErika called her mother, who unleashed a guttural scream at work.\n\nLo\u00efe has grown excited at the prospect of her mother's transplant. Erika just wants to be able to walk her to school or take her to the playground.\n\nDr. Mayo was preparing for surgery when he took Scott's call. Elation spread across the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University where doctors, nurses and staff celebrated.\n\nIn Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo heard the welcome news from his transplant coordinator. He'd not spoken with anyone at UHC about the case in the five days since the previous denial.\n\n\"They had decided on their own. We hadn't gotten back to them,\" he said. \"I'm happy they ended up sharing our vision.\"\n\nI had been speaking with Erika and Scott for this story over the last month and had reviewed her medical records extensively. During the May 2 phone call in which Erika was told her transplant had been denied, Scott told the UHC rep that the couple had been speaking with a member of the national news media.\n\nI was on a flight to Oregon when they received the joyous news. \"UHC just called and approved Erika. Unreal. Know you're in flight but call whenever,\" Scott texted.\n\nWhen we met a couple hours later, Erika's emotions were still raw. She thought this would be her last Mother's Day. Now, suddenly, she has hope for more.\n\nGlancing at her daughter and husband, Erika broke down in tears.\n\n\"I can't imagine not being here,\" she said. \"It's not because I keep the family together or anything. It's just the love I have for them.\"\n\n\"Mommy, why are you crying?\" Lo\u00efe said.\n\n\"I'm crying because I love you.\"\n\nLo\u00efe placed her fingers in her mother's right hand.\n\n\"Love you,\" Lo\u00efe said.\n\nAs she and Lo\u00efe locked hands, the tattoo on Erika's wrist displayed a fitting message: \"Be brave.\"\n\nDuring her cancer fight, Erika and her twin sister got matching tatoos with one message: \"Be brave.\"\n\nEpilogue\n\nUnitedHealthcare declined to answer CNN's questions about the handling of Erika's case, except to issue this one-sentence statement:\n\n\"We had on-going conversations with her husband and contacted him as soon as the decision was made to approve the transplant request.\"\n\nEven after the approval, Erika said she still wanted to move forward with the story, to speak up for others who've experienced the pain of similar denials. To let them know they're not alone. To encourage them to be their own best advocates.\n\nIt can mean the difference between life and death.\n\n\"No one should have to fight and work that hard,\" she said, \"especially when I have all these doctors saying it will save my life.\"\n\nSince the approval, the family has been preparing to move to Cleveland for Erika's surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic. Erika was officially notified Friday morning she was placed on the liver transplant wait list.\n\nIt's impossible to know how long the family will be in Cleveland or when the transplant will occur. Transplant candidates are given what is known as a \"MELD score,\" ranging from 6 to 40. Those closest to 40 are given the highest priority.\n\nErika's MELD score has hovered around 22. If her score is still in that range, Dr. Aucejo said, her transplant could be a few months away.\n\n\"But this varies a lot,\" he said. \"There are many variables at play here.\"\n\nA patient for a liver transplant, he said, is typically hospitalized 7 to 10 days for the procedure, with a recovery time of 4 to 8 weeks before the patient resumes normal activities.\n\nWould Erika have had the transplant by now if the surgery had been approved in February?\n\nEvery day Erika says she can feel her body deteriorating. \"I don't want to die,\" she says.\n\n\"That is very speculative, at the least,\" Dr. Aucejo said. \"I couldn't say that.\"\n\nHe chose his words carefully, saying it's a \"complex dynamic\" between hospitals and insurance companies and he doesn't want to upset that balance.\n\n\"She's been approved and that's what matters -- and hopefully we can move forward with her transplant.\"\n\nDr. Aucejo said he can somewhat understand the insurance company's initial reluctance at coverage because the procedure is so rare for patients with Erika's condition.\n\n\"It's a new territory,\" he told CNN. \"I can't blame anybody.\"\n\nIf Erika receives her transplant and succeeds, Dr. Aucejo said, she could help set precedent for many others down the road.\n\nMore than anything, she would finally get a chance to be the mother she wants to be.",

    "text": "La Jolla, California (CNN) To face each day, Claire Wineland undergoes hours of breathing treatments. It's a reality of living with cystic fibrosis she's come to accept.\n\nBut last month, as the nebulizer hummed loudly in her La Jolla, California, hotel room, she breathed in medicine through her mask and hoped this day would be the first step toward something different.\n\nShe'd traveled from Los Angeles with her mother, her best friend and her pit bull, Daisy, who flopped down on the floor atop one of Claire's ever-present oxygen tubes. A full day of appointments at a nearby medical center awaited her, when she would begin the evaluation process to see whether she might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant.\n\nA year earlier, Claire vowed that she'd never have the major surgery.\n\n\"It's not for me and never has been,\" she said at the time.\n\nShe was more comfortable dealing with the illness she knew than taking on the unknown. She preferred to focus on leading a purposeful life than worrying about death and how to dodge it.\n\nClaire Wineland sits in her hotel room with dog Daisy before heading to evaluations at the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health.\n\nA series of irreversible setbacks and some painful soul-searching, however, have prompted an about-face in her thinking. Claire, 21, needs new lungs, or she will die -- sooner than she's willing to accept.\n\nThe only question is: Did her change of heart come too late?\n\nFeeling trapped\n\nIt wasn't as if the clouds parted and she suddenly saw the light. Claire's new outlook was the result of a messy and humbling self-reckoning.\n\nShe had long managed to push through physical discomfort to lead a life that mattered. After emerging from a 16-day medically induced coma at age 13, she envisioned the Claire's Place Foundation , which today provides financial support to struggling families affected by cystic fibrosis. She appeared in brutally honest viral videos in which she talked about topics like death and did it with a smile. Since she was 14, she had been taking to stages and wowing audiences with beyond-her-years wisdom. Along the way, she nurtured a love of travel.\n\nShe was wrapping up a three-city tour last fall when pneumonia landed her in a Philadelphia hospital for two weeks.\n\nDoctors there sat her down and told Claire she had to stop flying. Period. They told her that her lungs could collapse and that she ran the risk of dropping dead on a plane, she said. They warned that it would be painful and laid out what it would feel like if an air pocket in her lungs burst.\n\n\"You will feel like you're being stabbed to death ... and then blood will stop flowing to your brain,\" she remembered them saying. \"And I was like, 'OK, I got the message! Copy that!' \"\n\nShe took a three-day train ride home and began to settle down.\n\nBecause her body works so hard to breathe, Claire must take in about 5,000 calories a day and relies on a feeding tube to absorb calories while she sleeps.\n\nCystic fibrosis affects more than 30,000 people in the United States (and more than 70,000 worldwide), according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The disease causes an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.\n\nThe median survival age is about 40, according to the foundation -- a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.\n\nClaire became uber-diligent with her care. She was on top of her dozens of medications, including her shots for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, endured as best she could the feeding tube at night, even though it made her throw up, and spent extra time with her breathing treatments. For four hours daily, she said, she wore a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus. She also tried supplements like turmeric and found comfort in the nettle infusions she drank throughout the day.\n\nBut even with all of this, her lung function continued to decline. In one year, she said her working lung capacity fell 10 points -- from 35% to 25%. Short walks and visits to the beach left this lover of the outdoors exhausted. Simple grocery shopping became too tough to manage. She had no energy for local speaking engagements and lost her income flow. She felt homebound, trapped and unable to do what mattered to her most.\n\nCFers, as she refers to people with cystic fibrosis, often talk about \"the Wheelchair Decision\" with dread, Claire said. But when breathing and getting around became too difficult and she got hers in February, it initially felt \"like freedom.\"\n\nWith her best friend, Larissa, taking on the role of \"designated wheeler,\" the duo could tool around outside. The day she got the wheelchair, they went on a seven-hour adventure around Los Angeles' Venice Beach, where Claire lives, visiting the canals, going to the park, soaking in the ocean breeze.\n\nAnd while most of the time, she has no qualms about needing a wheelchair, there are accessibility issues, the sidewalks are a mess, and she can't be pushed through sand. Inevitably, she's had those moments when she thinks, \"It sucks that I need this. It's painful that it's gotten this far.\"\n\nClaire breathes in medicine through a nebulizer as Larissa pounds her back with cupped hands to help loosen mucus in her airways.\n\nThen Claire, who's undergone more than 30 surgeries and been in the hospital a quarter of her life, received another jolt during a March hospital stay. Medical staff discovered that her portacath wasn't working. The small dome under the skin of her chest provides a central line into a vein, allowing easy administration of IV treatments -- such as antibiotics, which she must take regularly to beat back constant infections. A portacath replacement means surgery, and Claire's pulmonary function was -- and remains -- at a level too dangerous for her to go under anesthesia.\n\nThough the portacath was fixable, Claire didn't know it would be at the time. A wave of terror washed over her. She fell apart and realized it was time to take the transplant idea seriously.\n\n\"I can't go under anesthesia. I can't fly. I can't do anything,\" she remembered feeling with a panic. \"I have completely locked myself in a position of not being able to do anything besides die.\"\n\nReady for the race\n\nAfter leaving the La Jolla hotel, Claire was wheeled into the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health, prepared to meet with members of the lung transplant team.\n\nShe'd eaten a McDonald's McGriddle sandwich the day before -- a secret she employs to put on an extra pound or two before weigh-ins -- just in case they asked her and her 95-pound frame to step on a scale. She was armed with questions and a notepad, ready to studiously record all she'd learn. Since she'd been here less than two years earlier and decided against pursuing the transplant path then, she was eager to tell them why this time was different.\n\nA nurse who serves as the lung transplant coordinator, Megan Serletti, spent several hours educating Claire, her mom and Larissa about the process.\n\nMegan Serletti, top, a nurse who works as a lung transplant coordinator, leads Claire and her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, into the transplantation center.\n\nThey talked about the battery of tests that would determine whether she would qualify to get on the waiting list, some of which Claire knew well and described as \"gnarly.\" They discussed the lung allocation score, the number Claire will get if she's approved that measures how sick she is and determines where she sits on the priority list.\n\nThey discussed what life on a waitlist looks like: the necessity that she stay within a four-hour drive of the center, the importance of not ignoring phone calls, the exercise she'd need to grow stronger and the multitude of blood draws and exams she'd have on her schedule.\n\n\"We call a transplant your marathon,\" Serletti said. \"We tell people to train for your marathon. The day you get called is the day of the race.\"\n\nThere were forms to sign and questions she'd need to consider. For example, would she be willing to accept lungs from a prostitute?\n\n\"I'm fine if a donor had sex in exchange for money,\" Claire quipped. \"Way to bring the hustle.\"\n\nHow about from someone who was an IV drug user and contracted hepatitis C, a condition that is treatable?\n\n\"Honestly, I'd just laugh if I got new lungs and caught something else,\" she said. \"I already have the body of someone who's been around the block.\"\n\nSerletti spoke of the realities after surgery, including the drugs Claire would need to take for the rest of her life, the physical and emotional challenges she might face, the changes in lifestyle she'd have to honor.\n\nClaire wrote everything down. She curled her legs into the chair, revealing the tattoo on her left ankle: the thumbs-up \"Don't Panic\" logo from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"None of it spooked me,\" Claire said afterward, over lunch in the transplantation center's courtyard. \"Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do, I don't care about any of the side effects. I'm willing to deal with anything.\"\n\n'We both just started crying'\n\nTo qualify for new lungs, a person must be sick enough to need a transplant yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery.\n\nThere were 1,436 candidates for lung transplants as of April 20, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which manages the nation's organ waiting lists. Of those, 122 had a primary diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Last year, of the total 2,449 lung transplants performed, CFers accounted for nearly 11% of the recipients.\n\nUnlike previous introductory meetings, when her heart wasn't in it, Claire takes in every word during this education session about lung transplants.\n\nA lung transplant is not a cure, but it can extend a life, if all goes well.\n\nOf those who received lung transplants (not just CFers), dating to 2000, an average of 84% survived after one year, nearly 54% survived five years, and slightly more than 30% survived 10 years or more, according to the organ sharing network's data.\n\nDeciding to go for a lung transplant, let alone a double-lung transplant (the only option for CFers), is no small matter.\n\nClaire first visited a transplantation center at UCLA when she was 14 but said that was too early for the idea to make sense for her. At 17, she checked out the program at Stanford University but was turned down, her mom explained, because they could tell that Claire wasn't interested. She checked out the option again, at the very place she had returned to now, when she was 19.\n\nWhile her peers were being tasked with picking out prom dresses or decorating dorm rooms, she was being asked to contemplate her mortality.\n\nShe prayed that she'd want it as much as she knew her parents and doctors did, but her heart wasn't in it, she said. She was still happy with what she had and, as an adult, able to make her own decisions.\n\nHer parents, who split up when Claire was 3, struggled to make peace with her choice.\n\n\"Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it,\" her mother, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, pleaded at first. \"Get on the list so you can change your mind.\"\n\nBut ever since she'd been a small child, Claire had a sense of self, an understanding of her condition and a sort of intuition Yeager needed to trust -- even if it made her uncomfortable.\n\nHer dad, John Wineland, said Claire \"has a relationship with her body that is sacred\" and described his daughter's thinking: \"This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with.\"\n\nAnd as her parent, he said, \"I have to live with it.\"\n\nClaire was born with cystic fibrosis and has spent a quarter of her life in the hospital. (Family Photo)\n\nTo see her struggle and deteriorate over the past year was both sobering and excruciating for them. So when Claire broke down and said she'd changed her mind, they were thrilled, excited and terrified.\n\n\"I was blown away, so grateful, happy and hopeful. It was a sign that she wasn't willing to give up,\" remembered Yeager, who was with Claire at the hospital in March and heard the news first.\n\n\"I called her dad, and we both just started crying,\" Yeager said.\n\n\"I'm just praying my ass off, really, that everything goes smoothly, that she can get a shot at more time on the planet,\" Claire's dad said. \"There are a lot of hoops she has to jump through to be accepted.\"\n\n'Are you ready?'\n\nIt's not uncommon for CFers to change their minds about transplant, social worker Leslie Fijolek assured Claire.\n\nFijolek, who serves on the transplant team, remembered Claire from the last time she visited UC San Diego Health. Fijolek's job is to think about \"who are these [new] lungs going to live with,\" she said, get a sense of the care system recipients have in place and provide support to make the process successful for everyone involved.\n\nIs Claire compliant in taking her medications? Is she prepared to relocate near the transplantation center, where she'll need to be for at least three months after the transplant if she gets one? Who'd move with her and drive her to appointments?\n\n\"How's your mood been? Any depression and anxiety?\" Fijolek asked.\n\nLeslie Fijolek, a social worker, asks Claire hard questions to see whether she's prepared to take on what a transplant would mean.\n\nClaire mentioned how her decline, starting last fall, threw her into a depression. They talked about how she'd lost the ability to manage her physical decline, how she'd like to find a therapist who works with patients facing chronic illness, how she turns to arts and crafts projects to get out of bed -- and out of her head -- on rough days.\n\nPhotos on a cell phone are passed around, showing the papier-mache tree she's been working on and how the bark and surrounding foliage are remarkably true to life.\n\nFijolek turned serious, locked eyes with Claire and said what everyone in the room already understood: \"You know you need a transplant.\"\n\n\"I was so young. I was so na\u00efve,\" Claire answered, describing where she was before. \"All the side effects used to scare the shit out of me. My relationship to transplant and all it entails has changed.\"\n\nFijolek, who was all too familiar with Claire's past ambivalence, pushed her further.\n\n\"Let's say you got listed in about two weeks; it means you can get a call at any time,\" she said. \"Are you ready?\"\n\nClaire assured her she is.\n\n\"It's a big change from where you were,\" the social worker said.\n\n\"I didn't want to waste anyone's time,\" Claire answered.\n\nHer mother sat by, fanning herself with a medical brochure, listened and wiped a tear from her eye.\n\nAll she had\n\nThe last appointment of the day was with one of the transplant team's pulmonologists.\n\nDr. Kamyar Afshar explains the importance of Claire building her strength so she can handle the transplant, if she's given one.\n\nDr. Kamyar Afshar got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to know what antibiotics still worked for her, how many bowel movements she has a day and the last time she coughed up blood.\n\n\"Two days ago,\" she told him. \"It's usually one or two times a month.\"\n\nHe prescribed walks every day to build up her endurance and suggested she increase her continuous oxygen flow from her normal 2 liters per minute to 6 liters per minute when exercising. He looked down at her worn Birkenstocks and said, \"Your shoes will have to change.\"\n\nThe doctor cranked up her oxygen and told her that if she wanted to get a transplant, she'd need to be able to do 15 sits-to-stands in a minute. He said this was non-negotiable. She won't be able to use her arms after the surgery to get up from a chair or bed, he explained.\n\nHe asked her to climb off the exam table and show him some squats.\n\nClaire -- who used to do yoga six days a week, loved to swim and even went through a phase when she did difficult workout videos like P90X with her dad -- crossed her arms in front of her chest and showed the doctor all she had.\n\nFor the first time that day, her cheeks had color.\n\n\"I don't anticipate you'd be on the list for too long,\" Afshar blurted out.\n\nGiven her blood type and her condition, he said, she'd probably get a transplant within three months of being approved -- if she's approved.\n\nThe first full day of evaluation appoitnments complete, Claire and her mom breathe sighs of overwhelmed relief.\n\nClaire's eyes opened wide, and her mom appeared to melt into her chair. Suddenly, it seemed real.\n\n\"Three months!\" Yeager said outside the center. \"That made me want to throw up a little bit.\"\n\n\"I'm a little overwhelmed,\" Claire said. \"I need to go back to the hotel and binge-watch 'Real Housewives.' I want to see white women fight over nothingness.\"\n\nHoping for a chance\n\nThe truth is, according to Claire, not longing for different lungs for most of her life served her well.\n\nShe was able to \"work with what I had in front of me,\" she said, rather than fixate on what she didn't have. She also suppressed that part of herself that might have simply dreamed of something more.\n\n\"If I had told myself things could be better than they are now, I think I would have driven myself crazy with frustration and jealousy over other people's lives,\" she said.\n\nIn changing her mind, she said she had to swallow some of her pride and \"open this floodgate of emotion that I kept really deeply buried.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA slew of tests still awaited Claire, but she was now all in. She had opened herself up to the possibility that life -- for her -- could be different and not as challenging.\n\n\"For the first time ever, I'm going there, and it's really scary,\" she said. \"Now that I actually want something better, what if it doesn't happen? What if I don't get it? What if it goes wrong?\"\n\nThe pressure is on, and Claire can only hope that she will be given her chance.",

    "text": "For a busy physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, that may be expected, but the reason behind the calls wasn't exactly run-of-the-mill.\n\nThe people on the other end of the line were athletes in search of a particular kind of fix: They wanted him to dope them -- via their genes.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Sweeney made headlines because of his research on \"Schwarzenegger mice,\" which were up to 30% stronger than their average counterparts. Sweeney had been able to isolate the gene responsible for activating a protein -- IGF-1 -- that controls muscle growth and repair.\n\nThe main focus of his experiments was on how to limit the deterioration of muscles with age, but the results also appealed to athletes in search of a performance boost.\n\nWord got out, however, that he was not interested.\n\nAhead of this year's Commonwealth Games, which started April 4, Sweeney's was not such a hot number for athletes in search of an unfair advantage -- possibly because he is now an adviser for the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\n\"At the beginning, when we first started publishing on this, we did get contacted by high-level athletes,\" said Sweeney, who's also director of the University of Florida's Myology Institute. \"These days, it's mostly body builders and people desperate to increase their performance or abilities.\"\n\nBack then, gene therapy -- defined as the technique of using and manipulating genes in order to treat or prevent diseases -- wasn't as established as it is today and wasn't recognised as enough of a threat to be listed as a banned practice in sport. But it soon became known that gene therapies could one day be used for much more than disease.\n\nResponding promptly to the possibility, in 2002, the anti-doping agency established \"gene and cell-doping panels\" of expert scientists to discuss how best to head off the problem.\n\nIn 2003, the organization banned \"gene doping,\" which it defined as the \"nontherapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or modulation of gene expression, having the capacity to enhance performance.\"\n\nThis new frontier of doping presented a simple and dark idea: What if there was a way for dopers to never be caught?\n\nNow, almost 20 years later, the technology is has finally been used to treat patients with rare diseases -- such as severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disorder, hemophilia, blindness, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases -- by transferring missing genes into skeletal muscles, Sweeney said. \"So because of that, it is now at a point where potentially it could be used by athletes.\n\n\"It could be done today in athletes if some company and government would put the resources (in) to make it happen,\" he said.\n\nGetting inside your genes\n\nIn the case of the \"Schwarzenegger mice,\" Sweeney used the classic method of gene therapy, in which he modified the animals' DNA using a virus to deliver and insert the required gene that would make the mice stronger.\n\nGenes are delivered into an organism using a \"vector,\" the most common being viruses, like that used by Sweeney, which have been modified to be safe and no longer cause disease. The vectors carry the desired gene into targeted cells and, there, unload the genetic material, which in turn instructs the organism to produce the protein the gene encodes.\n\nOne example of a protein well-known to athletes is erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, which regulates the production of red blood cells in the body, increasing hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\nWith the injection of external EPO, elite athletes -- often cyclists -- have been enhancing performance for years, but authorities have caught on. Anti-doping controls can now detect external EPO efficiently through blood and urine tests.\n\nA doping urine test kit is seen on February 25, 2015 in Chatenay, France.\n\nIf extra EPO is being produced organically by a cell's machinery, however, it is almost impossible to detect as a banned substance.\n\nBut the technology is not quite at that level yet.\n\n\"Making the viruses that are involved in doing the gene transfer is still difficult,\" Sweeney said, highlighting that the science is still complicated and not something athletes could readily do at home.\n\nAnother way to dope an athlete's genes is through CRISPR, or CRISPR-Cas9, a technique that allows geneticists to edit specific parts of a person's genome by removing or altering sections of DNA -- also known as gene editing.\n\nThe technique is rapidly developing, leading to a World Anti-Doping Agency announcement in October that it was expanding its \"gene-doping\" ban to \"gene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression.\"\n\nThe ban went into effect in January.\n\n\"There's a couple of ways you can use CRISPR-Cas9,\" Sweeney said. \"One is to take cells from a person, modify those cells and put them back into the person, and that is probably the safest way to use it.\n\n\"The other way to use it, which is to modify your existent DNA in the body, is potentially very unsafe.\"\n\nFalse kit of genetics editing with Crispr Cas-9 technology.\n\nSweeney pointed out that scientists do not know what unintended consequences could come from changing a specific gene in an individual, meaning the technology is not even ready for trials in patients with lethal diseases.\n\nIn the case of gene-doping through gene therapies, using vectors for delivery, it's relatively easy to look for an extra copy of a gene and confirm that an athlete has been doped when you have access to a biological sample, such as blood, said Olivier Rabin, senior executive director of sciences and international partnerships at the anti-doping agency.\n\nIn particular, Rabin said, the agency looks at white-blood cells and has developed a methodology that can be applied to search for different genes. Further detail was not provided, as it is kept confidential in order to catch athletes, he added.\n\n\"Gene editing is a little more complex than gene therapy,\" Rabin added. The anti-doping agency is working on strategies to reveal the possibility of people editing their genes for performance enhancement, he said.\n\nRabin highlighted that most of the agency's efforts focus on white blood cells as \"pretty good markers of gene manipulation\" because some evidence of manipulation will usually end up in the blood.\n\nAsked what it is doing to monitor and test athletes for gene doping, the International Olympic Committee did not comment directly but said, \"We have nothing to add to the section on gene doping in WADA's prohibited list.\"\n\nThe question now is whether the first few cases have, in fact, happened without our knowledge.\n\nModern occurrence\n\n\"I never heard anything about it except for one time, and it was around five years ago,\" said Sebastian Weber, coach of four-time Union Cycliste Internationale world champion (time trialling) Tony Martin. \"There was some buzz around a substance called AICAR,\" or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide.\n\nAICAR is a performance-enhancing drug that the French Anti-Doping Agency suspected was used in the 2009 Tour de France; it stimulates mitochondria, the part in the muscles responsible for aerobic energy production.\n\nIn cycling, for gene doping to be effective, techniques should target both EPO levels and red blood cell production to have a higher oxygen delivery to the muscles, Weber says -- but they would also need to increase the mass and number of mitochondria in order to actually produce energy from that oxygen.\n\n\"Just because you have more oxygen, it doesn't necessary mean you also have the capacity to produce energy out of it,\" Weber said.\n\nAs AICAR was a drug, it wasn't gene doping, but it led people to wonder about what was next, he says, after this \"first step\" toward stimulating the body's mitochondria. \"That was the only time I heard people talking about the possibility of gene-doping.\"\n\nTailoring to your genes\n\nThere are other ways genetics -- and a deep knowledge of them -- could help athletes improve their performance, by understanding their physiology.\n\nFor example, project GENESIS -- focused on how applied genomics in elite sports can improve performance -- and its offshoot, the RugbyGene Project, are trying to identify which genetic characteristics help athletes succeed.\n\n\"We recognize it is not only genetic,\" said Dr. Alun Williams, an exercise geneticist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK who works on both projects. \"Training, diet and other lifestyle habits are massive factors. But along with that, the evidence is that it's impossible to have success in sports without some genetic [factors] in your favor.\"\n\nThe researchers of these projects are hoping to identify which genes help -- or hinder -- athletes in their specific disciplines, to develop their skills in a more tailored way. For example, if an athlete has shown to have a higher genetic vulnerability to tendon injuries, scientists and coaches could reduce certain aspects of their training load over the course of the season, give longer rest periods, reduce the number of matches played in a season, or provide specific exercises and pre-habilitation workouts.\n\nBut Williams points out that the field is still at an early stage. \"This picture where certain genes (or even two or three genes) are related to a particular characteristic, like the tendon injury, is still a small bit of a bigger picture,\" he said. \"So it's very important that this information that is available is put into context.\"\n\nA different point of view\n\nSome experts argue that we're looking at it all wrong and that athletes will always use the most modern technology to seek out an advantage -- illegal or not.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Modern sports have been principally valued on the basis of record-breaking and being able to witness extraordinary performances,\" said bioethicist Andy Miah, the University of Salford Chair in Science Communication and Future Media and author of \"Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics, Gene Doping and Sport.\" \"Even if it's not a world record, it's about trying to see something special in what humans can do, and often, that is about transcending boundaries.\"\n\nWe give athletes all sort of technology to do that, added Miah, who readily claims to \"disagree with anti-doping.\"\n\nInstead of the current scenario, in which anti-doping keeps trying to catch up with doping, Miah suggests a safer form of performance enhancement.\n\n\"If we can have a system where enhancement was actually medically supervised, then I think that is a much more safe and healthy.",

    "text": "(CNN) Two years ago, Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.\n\nShe could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\"She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her,\" he told an FDA advisory committee.\n\nHe believed that a new medication called Nuplazid, made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals, was the answer.\n\nNuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a \"breakthrough therapy\" -- meaning that it demonstrated \"substantial improvement\" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process, which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.\n\nStill, to recommend approval, the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients.\n\nSome FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials, though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.\n\nBut the physician who led the FDA's medical review, Dr. Paul Andreason, warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes, including death, at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing, he said, had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks.\n\nI remember leaving really, really frustrated FDA advisory committee member\n\nWhile Tyne had heard about these risks, he said he \"discounted death as a real statistical possibility\" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.\n\n\"I have two young children who love their grandmother,\" he told the committee. \"If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy, my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving, funny, caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please, I beg you, do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love.\"\n\n'You have to take it seriously'\n\nThe committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients . Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective, Andreason said in his medical review, though they showed similar risk.\n\nEven some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations, according to the hearing transcript. \"I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small, and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this, I think they're probably willing to take that risk,\" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a \"plea\" to the FDA to \"consider a large observational study so we can ensure that, once it goes into real-world use, that the benefits will outweigh the risks.\"\n\nIt hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it, sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017.\n\nTyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months, he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease, and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. \"She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all,\" he said.\n\nShortly after the drug's release, patients' family members, doctors and other health care professionals started reporting \"adverse events\" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue. In more than 1,000 reports, patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.\n\nCreatures like cats and snakes can haunt patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis, as shown in Acadia's TV commercial.\n\nIn November, an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was \"not providing the expected benefit\" or potentially worsening the condition.\n\nTracked by the FDA, these so-called \"adverse event reports\" document deaths, side effects and other issues, and can be made directly by consumers, caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker, which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases, the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others, the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug.\n\nAn adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label, for instance, or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.\n\nAfter analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports \"reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good.\" Thomas Moore, senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit, said the deaths are an \"important warning signal\" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action, depending on what the review finds.\n\nSince the institute released its analysis, FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medication listed as \"suspect\" in at least 500 of the death reports.\n\nThis is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported...you have to take it seriously. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research\n\nPhysicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths, they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks.\n\n\"This is almost unheard of, to have this many deaths reported,\" said Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research, adding that because reports are voluntary, potential problems may be underreported. \"You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously.\"\n\nAcadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to the FDA, and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.\n\nAcadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease, meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus, the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death, which it is required to pass along to the FDA.\n\n\"If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers, it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported, especially in an older, chronically ill patient population,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIt said its \"benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged,\" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted, for example, that since the drug's approval, two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.\n\nThe company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic, professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. \"I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug,\" Jankovic said in the statement. \"While not all patients are completely satisfied, many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations, paranoia and other psychotic symptoms.\"\n\nIn an interview this week, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available, like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product, he said he is \"familiar with the circumstances\" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is \"appropriately balancing\" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard, however, and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.\n\nJUST WATCHED FDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we face Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH FDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we face 03:54\n\n\"You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known,\" he said.\n\nThe FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's \"complex safety profile,\" recognized at the time of its approval, resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.\n\nThe cases reported so far, according to the FDA, typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.\n\nWhat should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\"Based on these data, the FDA has, at this time, not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe \"black box\" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients, after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain, its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so, Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.\n\nGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.\n\nTo determine the true risks of Nuplazid, the researchers interviewed by CNN said, the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports, which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that, because the drug was already approved, these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.\n\nHundreds of adverse event reports\n\nA CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.\n\nIn these reports, the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases, it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others, family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.\n\nThis is exactly what I thought I was going to happen. Dr. Paul Andreason, who led the FDA medical review of Nuplazid\n\nOne report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning, a nurse noted that the woman was \"sleepy.\" Shortly after, she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and, less than an hour after the nurse's visit, she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was \"related\" to Nuplazid, her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.\n\nIn another report, an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report, a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away, she said, she was told by \"someone at the hospital\" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.\n\nAcadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there \"is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid.\" Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid, which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug, along with Medicare claims data. However, multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.\n\nWidening the patient pool\n\nIn the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths, Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock, some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.\n\nCurrently, Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day, according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank . That can add up to more than $30,000 a year for a single patient, though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.\n\nAcadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.\n\nAcadia's TV commercial shows how frightening Parkinson's disease psychosis can be.\n\nThe company, meanwhile, is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October, the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well, meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process.\n\nWhile a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason, insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population, concerned medical experts told CNN.\n\n\"You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else,\" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. \"If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much, much larger -- that would be unconscionable.\n\n\"That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk.\"\n\n'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up'\n\nRoughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting, where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.\n\nAndreason, the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid, no longer works for the agency.\n\nHe said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time, he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that, when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's, physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.\n\nHe said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.\n\nKnowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Son of Parkinson's patient\n\n\"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen,\" he said. \"We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths.\"\n\nDr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting, recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are, but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that, after previous studies didn't show it was effective, the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured, which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used \"consistent, appropriate, and validated assessment methodology.\"\n\n\"If patients know there is some level of benefit, they can judge their risk,\" said Fox-Rawlings. \"But if we don't even know that it does work, how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope.\"\n\nKim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.\n\n\"I remember leaving really, really frustrated,\" she said.\n\nCNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting, despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials, to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.\n\nOne of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the \"staggering cost\" of the medication, she said, she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months, he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories, however, and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.\n\nThe other person was Tyne.\n\nThe 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid, but he still gets frustrated talking about it.\n\n\"Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up,\" he said.\n\nBut he doesn't regret trying.\n\n\"If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror.\"\n\nDo you have information to share about Nuplazid or other drugs targeting the elderly?

    "text": "(CNN) For the past 20 years, Hope Workman has hustled up a dirt path on the side of a mountain in Lovely, Kentucky, just to get drinking water. She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap.\n\nIf she's by herself, she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along, they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3\u00bd-foot PVC pipe.\n\nThe day CNN visited, the temperature was just above freezing, and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water.\n\n\"This is what we go through to get water, unfortunately,\" she said.\n\nWorkman is not the only person in Martin County, Kentucky, or America for that matter, who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint, Michigan's, lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria.\n\nAs our water infrastructure system ages, experts say, keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.\n\nAccording to the the society, about 1 million miles of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water, much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age, they can crack, and water breaks become more common. In fact, the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes.\n\nFor many cash-strapped local utilities, it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see.\n\nFaucets run brown\n\nBut when the problem does come to the surface, it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes, it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes, it smells like diesel fuel.\n\nLocals ask themselves, \"Just what's in the water?\"\n\nUntil several months ago, customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids . These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer.\n\nEastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity, but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame.\n\n'We're just scared of the water'\n\nMartin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water.\n\n\"We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years,\" she said.\n\n\"You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut,\" Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. \"I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better, but I don't feel any better about it.\"\n\nDr. Don Lafferty, a local physician, feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. \"I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe,\" he told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\n\"We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region.\"\n\nWhere the War on Poverty began\n\nNestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky, Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015, the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal. But as the coal industry died out, Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate.\n\nBut poverty has been endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty.\n\n\"In 2018, in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine,\" said Gary Ball, editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper, The Mountain Citizen.\n\nWhat's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country, said Lindell Ormsbee, director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.\n\n\"I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other places where no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine,\" Ormsbee said.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nA large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county, placed up and over rocky terrain, making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today, more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet.\n\nWhen water systems are operating optimally, there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially, there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe, the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes, there is suddenly room for soil, debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water.\n\nAnd because of the leakage issues, the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years, said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. \"As far as systematic lines, it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished.\"\n\nBurns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine.\n\nBut on top of issues with the lines, there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities, pumps and meters that still need to be made.\n\nInvestments in hardware and software are needed\n\nFor a financially struggling municipality, it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates, which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income.\n\nInfrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware, Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management.\n\nSmall water systems, such as Martin County, that serve less than 10,000 customers supply water to nearly 20% of the country . In addition to infrastructure and financial challenges, many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact, small systems made up 72% of EPA violations in 2015 and 2016.\n\nSome citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. \"Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries,\" Lafferty said. \"We are Americans, too.\"\n\nBall points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez, the county seat. The cost is nearly $20 million, money that he said could have been spent on upgrading the water system.\n\nSome relief\n\nRecently, Martin County received federal grants amounting to $3.4 million to go toward its water system. Experts believe that overhauling the system would take $13.5 million to $15 million.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPresident Trump's infrastructure proposal gives some residents hope. The $1.5 trillion plan touted by the White House is supposed to cover all infrastructure upgrades in the nation, but experts believe that it would cost the country $1 trillion just to maintain and meet the demands for drinking water for the next 25 years.\n\nCritics further point out the White House's plan earmarks only $200 billion in federal investment. The remainder is to be made up by the states and the private sector.\n\n\"Time will tell,\" Lafferty said. \"Politicians should remember that 'forgotten people' usually have long memories.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) They're not slumped over in alleyways with used needles by their sides. Their dignity, at least from outside appearances, remains intact. They haven't lost everything while chasing an insatiable high.\n\nThey are functioning heroin addicts -- people who hold down jobs, pay the bills and fool their families.\n\nFor some, addiction is genetic; they're wired this way. For others, chronic pain and lack of legal opioids landed them here. Or experimentation got them hooked and changed everything.\n\nWhat addicts have in common, according to experts, is a disease that has more to do with their brains than the substances they use. About 85% of people can take a pain pill, for example, and never crave it again.\n\nThis is a story about the others, those traveling the dangerous road of functional addiction. What works for them now, experts explain, can easily and lethally be derailed.\n\nHanging in the balance are people you may never imagine: peers, co-workers and neighbors. Loved ones, bosses and teachers. Respected members of your community who, for the benefit of everyone's understanding, want to be heard.\n\nAfter CNN gave voice last fall to addicts on skid row , the sorts we think of when we picture \"heroin addict,\" I set out to tell this overlooked part of the heroin story.\n\nBeing a functioning addict hinges on heroin use staying hush-hush, so we agreed to change the names of those willing to open up.\n\n'All smiles and happiness at work'\n\nLoving and successful parents, good schools, a great upbringing in the Midwest: Todd can't point to anything that drove him to drugs. He was a typical suburban high school student who dabbled in weed. Then, at 15, he popped a Percocet his mother left lying around while she was recovering from surgery.\n\n\"The feeling in my head was, 'I want to feel like this for the rest of my life,' \" Todd says. \"It was the perfect drug for me.\"\n\nThe 11 years since have been a dance with opioid addiction, even as he graduated from college and embarked on a successful career in corporate management. Now 26, he has gone stretches where he's been sober, but the pull is strong and keeps yanking him back.\n\nHe's done heroin for periods of time and says it's \"fantastic,\" but shooting up isn't his style. His preference, assuming he can find them, is to buy more expensive opioids. For a long time, OxyContin was his drug of choice; now he prefers Opana and, if he can't get that, Subutex.\n\nHe makes good money, which means he can afford his $350- to $600-a-week habit.\n\nHe's figured out how much to take so he doesn't feel the pains of withdrawal, which is now his goal -- rather than getting a full-on high. His sweet spot: 60 milligrams of Opana.\n\n\"I don't know how to describe withdrawal. It's like the worst flu you've ever had in your life -- and then multiply that by 1,000,\" he says. \"There's a scraping inside your brain. You're willing to do anything to feel better.\"\n\nTo avoid that hell, Todd often lives a lie. He's \"all smiles and happiness at work,\" he says, and he spins tales to guard his secret. He might say he's in one city when he's really in another. That quick trip he says he's taking to McDonald's could be to meet his dealer at Burger King. When he's used heroin, he's explained the bruises on his arm by telling people he has diabetes or an infectious disease. He once told a pharmacist he was a science teacher in need of syringes for experiments. He's invented the deaths of family members to get days off.\n\nBut death is very much a reality in his life.\n\nHis last serious girlfriend also used drugs and died from an overdose. Over the past six years, he's lost seven people he cares about to addiction.\n\nHe'd like to find love, build a relationship and have a family but says, \"It would be dishonest, and I never want to hurt anybody. That's the biggest problem.\"\n\nHe knows that he has a lot to live for, but he often forgets that and struggles to imagine a future. And because he can't stray far from his dealer, a dream he does have remains on hold indefinitely.\n\n\"I've always wanted to see the world,\" he says. \"I've never been outside the country because I can't leave. I'm f***ing chained where I'm at. It's a f***ing prison.\"\n\nThe sign of an addict\n\nThe sensation Todd had the first time he popped a Percocet, that feeling he wanted to hold onto for the rest of his life, was the giveaway. He, like 10% or 15% of people, has the disease of addiction, explains Dr. Stuart Gitlow, past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine\n\nWhat offers no special high for most people or may even make them feel queasy became Todd's aspiration. And part of the problem, says Gitlow, is that \"you don't know in advance what person you're going to be.\"\n\nTodd may be functioning now, but Gitlow warns that tolerances and doses often change. As an addictive disease progresses, it is also influenced by life events and stressors. What happens if Todd loses his job someday or can't afford his preferred pills?\n\n\"They all start out functioning,\" he says. \"The bulk of people taking heroin are probably functioning. It's only in the end stage that they're nodding off in an alley and have a pretty good shot of dying.\"\n\nWhat Todd needs, Gitlow says, is help from a doctor who is certified in addiction medicine and can treat his disease. The vast majority, or 80%, of those who seek appropriate treatment and adhere to their treatment recommendations do well, he says.\n\nNot a unique story\n\nIt didn't start with a pill for Lisa. Her first addiction took hold at 12, when she began cutting herself.\n\nCarving into her flesh released dopamine in her brain, giving her a high, she says. The first time she did it, she never anticipated a rush. She was overwhelmed emotionally and simply acting out. But cutting became her way to self-medicate because it offered her solace, easing the emotional pain of living in a household full of screaming.\n\nNow, at 23, Lisa opts for heroin. And because of it and other opioids she's used, \"I hurt myself a lot less.\"\n\nThe difference now is that she, like Todd, no longer seeks a high. When she shoots up each morning, she insists, \"I just do enough to stay well\" through the day and not feel physical pain.\n\nShe works hard, always has. She excelled in her college-prep private school, where she was dubbed \"gifted and talented,\" she says. She takes her job as a store manager seriously and enjoys a supportive marriage. No one at work knows that her day begins with a call to her dealer. If she has track marks, a simple long-sleeved shirt hides the evidence.\n\nHow she found heroin, she says, is not unique.\n\nLong plagued by tendonitis in her knees and two herniated discs in her back, Lisa tried everything. Steroid injections gave her migraines, and her stomach couldn't handle anti-inflammatories. Physical and aquatic therapies offered little relief, as did deep-tissue massage. Finally, four years ago, a physician wrote out a prescription for pain pills.\n\nShe found comfort in those legal opioids. But then came the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, she says, effectively ending her lawful pain management.\n\nOnce her pills ran out, she turned to buying them on the street. They were hard to find, though, and the cost became prohibitive. An old friend, a heroin user, suggested that she give his drug a try.\n\n\"I can't find pills, I'm in pain, and it's really cheap,\" she remembers telling herself. \"What happened to me is what happened to thousands and thousands of people.\"\n\nWhere she lives in Texas, near the Mexican border, the price of heroin can't be beat. One pill might cost her $50, but she can get half a gram of heroin, which is far more potent, for $20. The same product, she says, would cost up to five times as much in other parts of the country.\n\n\"If I moved somewhere where it was $100,\" she says, \"I'd quit.\"\n\nHer husband doesn't do drugs. He barely drinks. And although he'd prefer she kick the habit altogether, he's committed to being by her side -- so much that he keeps Narcan, the overdose antidote drug, in their home and has watched training videos to learn how to administer it in case she overdoses.\n\n\"He loves me enough that he's willing to stay with me,\" Lisa says. \"That's a key component to keeping me from going off the deep end.\"\n\nLisa says a small handful of friends know that she uses heroin. Everyone else, her family included, believes she's hooked on \"just pills.\" It's easier that way. Pills and other vices don't come with the same sort of judgment.\n\n\"People drink, and we think nothing of it. You do heroin, and you're the scum of the earth,\" she says. \"People will cut you out of their lives.\"\n\nEverybody's problem\n\nHeroin users weren't always \"the scum of the earth.\" In the late 19th century, it was a trademark name for an over-the-counter drug made by Bayer.\n\nToday, there are politics behind which drugs are demonized and which aren't, and much of that is rooted in racism, says Dr. Michael Miller, who preceded Gitlow as president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.\n\nWhite socialites snorting cocaine in an Aspen ski lodge are forgiven, while inner-city blacks smoking crack -- just another form of cocaine -- are vilified and locked away, Miller explains. Heroin was romanticized when musicians used it, he says, but after black kids in coastal cities got hold of it, the perception changed and stuck.\n\nNow, with the explosion of the opioid epidemic and the emergence of heroin as a less expensive alternative, it's become everybody's problem -- white or black, rich or poor, on the coasts or in middle America, no matter whether you live in a city, suburb or rural community.\n\nThat's how Lisa got roped in and learned to keep a secret.\n\nShe admits that the management of her addiction hinges in large part on her husband being by her side. But what if he leaves? What if life tosses her another kind of doozy? How much heroin would she need to ease her pain then?\n\n\"She has no coping skills. She's right at the edge,\" Gitlow says. \"What if her dealer gets arrested and her new dealer mixes in fentanyl? Boom. She's dead.\"\n\n'Like downing a beer'\n\nNot everyone I spoke to considers themselves addicts. Enter Matthew.\n\nFor as long as Matthew can remember, he's battled anxiety and depression. Beyond prescriptions like Xanax or Valium, he began self-medicating at 19 with marijuana and LSD, he says.\n\nAn arrest for possession of pot and LSD with intent to distribute landed him on probation. Facing regular drug tests that would detect cannabis, he turned to harder drugs that wouldn't stay in his urine as long. That's how Matthew, 28, first tried oxycodone.\n\nLater, a doctor would prescribe opioids for chronic stomach pain, a condition he's had for six years.\n\nIt's the sort of pain, he says, that used to leave him racing to bathrooms so frequently, he couldn't keep a job. Multiple GI doctors have tried to help him. Only prescribed opioids and marijuana have offered relief.\n\nRaised in the Eastern US, he now lives in rural Northern California and works as a consultant in the cannabis industry. He doesn't hide his marijuana use or his dependence on pain medications.\n\nIt's the powdered heroin he purchases on the dark net, the stuff he snorts in the bathroom a few times a day, that he keeps to himself. He says he uses it only when his prescriptions or insurance coverage lapse.\n\nHe's never used heroin intravenously. Having gone back and forth between pharmaceuticals and illegal supplies, he says he's able to use a milligram scale to carefully measure how much of the powder to take.\n\n\"It's similar to a dose of Percocet.\" he says. \"The effect would be like downing a beer or a cocktail.\"\n\nHe doesn't use a lot and says he snorts only about $5 of heroin a day. He's stopped in spurts and has written down pro and con lists to see whether he can move on. The pros keep winning out.\n\n\"I just don't find sober me is the best me,\" he says.\n\nHaving a secret can be isolating, he says, but otherwise, heroin has not hindered his life. Rather, Matthew says, \"It's changed my life for the better.\"\n\nNot only does it help with the pain, he says, it constipates him, allowing him to ditch the bathroom and get out of the house.\n\n\"I'm dependent,\" he says. \"But I wouldn't necessarily call myself an addict.\"\n\nThe crippling truth\n\nMatthew is kidding himself, experts say.\n\n\"Denial is a crippling component of addictive disease,\" Gitlow said. \"Here we have a well-documented illustration of that deadly component.\"\n\nStarting at 19, the signs were there when Matthew turned to drugs rather than \"conventional coping mechanisms,\" Gitlow explains. Someone without the addictive disease might have tried those drugs for temporary relief but then realized they weren't worth the long-term risk.\n\nMatthew's belief that he doesn't have a problem, Gitlow says, is no different from a man with hypertension or diabetes pretending there's nothing wrong with him.\n\nPlus, using heroin and other opioids changes brain chemistry, says Siobhan Morse, director of clinical services for the Foundations Recovery Network.\n\nThe natural way a body manages pain or stress, Morse says, is by producing endorphins.\n\n\"If you're giving it the artificial substance,\" she explains, the brain thinks it doesn't have to make the real thing. \"So when you take away the artificial substance, everything is so painful.\"\n\nAnd for people like Matthew who have coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, self-medication with opioids can make those matters worse, Morse adds. She describes the combination as a \"moving target.\"\n\nEventually, she and other experts say, Matthew's drug use will catch up with him.\n\n\"I've never met anyone who's indefinitely held it down being a heroin addict,\" Morse says.\n\nThe fall of 'Superwoman'\n\nRebecca has been using for more than three decades -- longer than Matthew, Todd and Lisa combined. She is surprised to still be alive.\n\nShe grew up in an upper-middle-class household in a tony suburb in the South where she was raised more by the housekeeper than her parents. Her mother was checked out; her father had mistresses and often traveled.\n\n\"I didn't have any boundaries,\" says Rebecca, 59. \"I could do whatever I wanted, which was a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nStarting at 12, she tried every narcotic she could find. At 15, the man who was her drug dealer and boyfriend introduced her to heroin.\n\n\"I was in love,\" she says of the drug. \"It became the love of my life.\"\n\nOne day, she was sleeping on the couch in her family's home when an older sister pinned her down, rolled up one of her sleeves and called out her track marks.\n\n\"Mom didn't bat an eye,\" Rebecca remembers. Instead, she shrugged it off, saying, \"Jewish people aren't addicts.\"\n\nHer father, when he was around, was more a friend than a parent. He partied with Rebecca and gave her Quaaludes, she says.\n\nRebecca eventually married the drug dealer-boyfriend, and they had a daughter. But the marriage was short-lived.\n\nDivorced and 24, Rebecca went into treatment after her daughter turned 3. Rebecca knew that she was unfit to be a parent and feared she'd lose her daughter forever. It was the first of some 20 times she'd check into a treatment facility for help.\n\nAlong the way, she re-married; husband No. 2 died of a heroin overdose.\n\nRebecca met her third husband in treatment and stayed sober for eight years. They had two more children and a comfortable lifestyle, enjoying the sort of privileges she knew growing up. But when this marriage fell apart, so did she.\n\n\"That was when I started to spiral down,\" Rebecca says. \"As soon as I started using, it was immediate. ... It was like I never stopped using.\"\n\nEven as Rebecca returned to heroin, spending $100 or more a day, she built a career in corporate travel, working for big-name companies.\n\n\"As long as I didn't run out [of heroin] and get sick, I was like Superwoman,\" she says of her job performance. \"If I had come in and said I was a heroin addict, people would have laughed.\"\n\nYears of use caught up with her. Lunchtime runs to see her dealer grew longer and became lies about flat tires or broken-down cars. She bounced around between five or six companies, taking extended leaves to go into treatment or try to detox at home. She kept overdosing. A $30,000 mistake at work got her fired.\n\n\"People kept saying, 'You're going to die,' \" Rebecca says. \"The problem with me wasn't that I was going to die, it's that I was going to live.\"\n\nHer kids were mostly raised by other family members and knew her at her worst. They'd see her after overdoses and visit her in the \"nasty places\" she called home. \"It was just awful,\" says Rebecca, who's still working to repair the relationships she frayed.\n\nToday, Rebecca is three years sober.\n\nThe last time she entered treatment, she says, \"something clicked, and I remember thinking, 'I can't do this anymore.' \"\n\nShe was \"sick and tired of being sick and tired,\" she says. \"I didn't have it in me anymore to keep doing what it took to stay high.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRebecca is not the only member of her family who's struggled.

    "text": "(CNN) As tens of thousands of Americans die from prescription opioid overdoses each year, an exclusive analysis by CNN and researchers at Harvard University found that opioid manufacturers are paying physicians huge sums of money -- and the more opioids a doctor prescribes, the more money he or she makes.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors across the country six-figure sums for speaking, consulting and other services. Thousands of other doctors were paid over $25,000 during that time.\n\nPhysicians who prescribed particularly large amounts of the drugs were the most likely to get paid.\n\n\"This is the first time we've seen this, and it's really important,\" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, where he is co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative.\n\n\"It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics, and that's very disturbing,\" said Kolodny, who is also the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing.\n\nThe Harvard researchers said it's not clear whether the payments encourage doctors to prescribe a company's drug or whether pharmaceutical companies seek out and reward doctors who are already high prescribers.\n\n\"I don't know if the money is causing the prescribing or the prescribing led to the money, but in either case, it's potentially a vicious cycle. It's cementing the idea for these physicians that prescribing this many opioids is creating value,\" said Dr. Michael Barnett, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nCNN spoke with two women who've struggled with opioid addiction, and they described the sense of betrayal they felt when they learned that their doctors had received large sums of money from the manufacturers of the drugs that had created such havoc in their lives.\n\nCarey Ballou said she trusted her doctor and figured that if he was prescribing opioids, it must be because they were the best option for her pain.\n\nThen she learned that opioid manufacturers paid her doctor more than a million dollars over two years.\n\n\"Once I found out he was being paid, I thought, 'was it really in my best interest, or was it in his best interest?' \" she said.\n\nTo do the analysis, CNN -- along with Barnett and Harvard's Dr. Anupam Jena -- examined two federal government databases. One tracks payments by drug companies to doctors, and the other tracks prescriptions that doctors write to Medicare recipients.\n\nThe CNN/Harvard analysis looked at 2014 and 2015, during which time more than 811,000 doctors wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients. Of those, nearly half wrote at least one prescription for opioids.\n\nFifty-four percent of those doctors -- more than 200,000 physicians -- received a payment from pharmaceutical companies that make opioids.\n\nDoctors were more likely to get paid by drug companies if they prescribed a lot of opioids -- and they were more likely to get paid a lot of money.\n\nAmong doctors in the top 25th percentile of opioid prescribers by volume, 72% received payments. Among those in the top fifth percentile, 84% received payments. Among the very biggest prescribers -- those in the top 10th of 1% -- 95% received payments.\n\nOn average, doctors whose opioid prescription volume ranked among the top 5% nationally received twice as much money from the opioid manufacturers, compared with doctors whose prescription volume was in the median. Doctors in the top 1% of opioid prescribers received on average four times as much money as the typical doctor. Doctors in the top 10th of 1%, on average, received nine times more money than the typical doctor.\n\n\"The correlation you found is very powerful,\" said David Rothman, director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. \"What's amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts but that more money counts even more.\"\n\nPaying doctors for speaking, consulting and other services is legal. It's defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications, but it has long been a controversial practice.\n\nPharmaceutical company payments to doctors are not unique to opioids. Drug companies pay doctors billions of dollars for various services. In 2015, 48% of physicians received some pharmaceutical payment\n\nDr. Steven Stanos, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said he wasn't surprised that doctors who frequently prescribe a drug are often chosen and paid to give speeches about the drug to other doctors.\n\n\"They know those medicines, and so they're going to be more likely to prescribe those because they have a better understanding,\" Stanos said, adding that some of the money paid to doctors may have been to teach other doctors about new \"abuse-deterrent\" opioid drugs.\n\nStanos' group accepted nearly $1.2 million from five of the largest opioid manufacturers in the United States between 2012 and 2017, according to a recent report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nStanos said the money was used for various projects, including courses on safe opioid prescribing.\n\n\"I would obviously hope that a physician would not prescribe based on some type of kickback or anything like that, that they'd obviously be prescribing [in] the best interest of the patient,\" he said.\n\nBut Dr. Daniel Carlat, former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the CNN and Harvard findings are in line with other studies suggesting that money from drug companies does influence a doctor's prescribing habits.\n\n\"It's not proof positive, but it's another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and not good for patient care,\" said Carlat, a psychiatrist who blogs about conflicts of interest. \"It makes me extremely concerned.\"\n\nBarnett, one of the Harvard researchers who worked with CNN, said pharmaceutical companies pay doctors for a reason.\n\n\"It's not like they're spending this money and just letting it go out into the ether,\" he said. \"They wouldn't be spending this money if it weren't effective.\"\n\nAccording to a statement by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, drug companies support mandatory and ongoing training for prescribers on the appropriate treatment of pain.\n\n\"PhRMA supports a number of policies to ensure patients' legitimate medical needs are met, while establishing safeguards that prevent overprescribing,\" according to the statement from the group.\n\nAngela Cantone at her home in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n'I trusted my doctor'\n\nAngela Cantone says she wishes she had known that opioid manufacturers were paying her doctor hundreds of thousands of dollars; it might have prompted her to question his judgment.\n\nShe says Dr. Aathirayen Thiyagarajah, a pain specialist in Greenville, South Carolina, prescribed her an opioid called Subsys for abdominal pain from Crohn's disease for nearly 2\u00bd years, from March 2013 through July 2015.\n\nSubsys is an ultrapowerful form of fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\"He said it would do wonders for me, and it was really simple and easy. You just spray it in your mouth,\" Cantone said.\n\nShe says Subsys helped her pain, but it left her in \"a zombie-like\" state. She couldn't be left alone with her three young children, two of whom have autism and other special needs.\n\n\"I blacked out all the time. I'd find myself on the kitchen floor or the front lawn,\" she said.\n\nShe says that if she missed even one day of the drug, she had uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nShe said she brought her concerns to Thiyagarajah, but he assured her it couldn't be the Subsys that was causing her health problems.\n\n\"I trusted him. I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer that's directing traffic when the light is out,\" she said.\n\nShe says that when she eventually asked Thiyagarajah to switch her to a non-opioid medication, he became belligerent.\n\n\"He said it was Subsys or nothing,\" she said.\n\nAngela Cantone holds an opioid called Subsys that her doctor prescribed to treat her prain from Crohn's disease.\n\nCantone would later learn that from August 2013 through December 2016, the company that makes Subsys paid Thiyagarajah more than $200,000, according to Open Payments , the federal government database that tracks payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors.\n\nCNN compared the $190,000 he received from 2014 to 2015 with other prescribers nationwide in the same medical specialty and found that he received magnitudes more than the average for his peers.\n\nNearly all of the payments were for fees for speaking, training, education and consulting.\n\nCantone is now suing Thiyagarajah, accusing him of setting out to \"defraud and deceive\" her for \"the sole purpose of increasing prescriptions, sales, and consumption of Subsys to increase ... profits.\"\n\nThrough his attorney, Thiyagarajah denied any wrongdoing but declined to comment on this story due to the pending litigation.\n\nIn a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit, Thiyagarajah denied all of the allegations against him and said that all medical care provided to Cantone was \"reasonable and appropriate and in keeping with the standard of care.\"\n\nHis attorney, E. Brown Parkinson, said the doctor is currently practicing medicine, alternating weeks between his practices in South Carolina and New York.\n\nThiyagarajah might be expected to write a relatively high number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers, given that he's board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a subspecialty in pain medicine.\n\nBut he wrote an unusually high number of prescriptions for Subsys and other opioids even when compared with other doctors with the same certifications.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, physicians with Thiyagarajah's certifications wrote an average of 3.7 opioid prescriptions per Medicare patient per year, according to the analysis by CNN and Harvard. Thiyagarajah, however, annually wrote more than seven opioid prescriptions per patient per year.\n\nAfter about two years on Subsys, Cantone says, she took herself off the drug cold turkey.\n\nAccording to an affidavit by an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Thiyagarajah's office was inspected by the agency in June 2015 and found to be prescribing another opioid, buprenorphine, \"for non-legitimate medical need\" in violation of federal law.\n\nIn March 2016, the agent conducted another inspection and seized 45 medical records related to Subsys.\n\nThe DEA did a compliance review and referred its findings to the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Robert Murphy, associate special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta Field Division.\n\nCantone is also suing Insys, the company that makes Subsys. Insys denied allegations of wrongdoing in a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit.\n\nSeparate from Cantone's lawsuit, John Kapoor, the founder and largest shareholder of Insys, was arrested and arraigned in federal court in October on charges of bribing doctors to overprescribe the drug.\n\n\"Dr. Kapoor engaged in no wrongdoing and refutes all of the charges in the strongest possible terms,\" said Tom Becker, a spokesman for Kapoor. \"He looks forward to being fully vindicated after having his day in court.\"\n\nKapoor resigned from the Insys board of directors in October, according to a company news release\n\nSeveral other Insys executives were arrested in connection with an alleged racketeering scheme.\n\nSeparately, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, is conducting an investigation into the opioid industry.\n\nAccording to her investigation and the federal indictment, Insys used a combination of tactics , such as falsifying medical records, misleading insurance companies and providing kickbacks to doctors in league with the company.\n\nSaeed Motahari, president and CEO of Insys, wrote a letter in September to McCaskill, noting that he was \"concerned about certain mistakes and unacceptable actions of former Insys employees.\" He added that most of the field-based sales staff were no longer with the company.\n\n\"I stand with you and share the desire to address the serious national challenge related to the misuse and abuse of opioids that has led to addiction and unnecessary deaths and has caused so much pain to families and communities around the country,\" Motahari added.\n\nThe analysis\n\nSometimes, pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to do medical research. They also pay doctors for promotional work: for example, to speak with other doctors about the benefits of a drug.\n\nAmong the doctors who prescribe the highest volume of opioids, the CNN/Harvard analysis found that the largest amount of money was paid for that second category, which includes speaking fees, consulting, travel and food.\n\nConcerns about payments to doctors by opioid manufacturers were brought to light last year in a study by researchers at Boston University.\n\nSeveral studies published in medical journals in recent years have found an association between payments by pharmaceutical companies for various types of drugs and doctors' prescribing habits.\n\nFor example, researchers at the University of North Carolina examined the two government databases analyzed by CNN and Harvard and found that when doctors received payments from manufacturers of certain cancer drugs, they were more likely to prescribe those drugs to their patients.\n\n\"This study suggests that conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry may influence oncologists in high-stakes treatment decisions for patients with cancer,\" the authors concluded.\n\nDr. Patrice Harris, a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association, said that the CNN and Harvard data raised \"fair questions\" but that such analyses show only an association between payments and prescribing habits and don't prove that one causes the other.\n\nIt's \"not a cause and effect relationship,\" said Harris, chairwoman of the association's opioid task force, adding that more research should be done on the relationship between payments and prescriptions.\n\n\"[We] strongly oppose inappropriate, unethical interactions between physicians and industry,\" she added. \"But we know that not all interactions are unethical or inappropriate.\"\n\nHarris added that relationships between doctors and industry are ethical and appropriate if they \"can help drive innovation in patient care and provide significant resources for professional medical education that ultimately benefits patients.\"\n\nStanos, the pain physician, said a doctor who gets paid by a pharmaceutical company and prescribes that company's drug might truly and legitimately believe that the drug is the best option for the patient.\n\n\"I hope physicians that do promotional talks prescribe because they think the medicine has a benefit,\" he said.\n\nBut Jena, one of the two Harvard researchers who collaborated on the CNN analysis, said he worries that money from opioid manufacturers -- especially large amounts of money -- could influence a doctor to prescribe opioids over less dangerous options.\n\n\"Every decision, every recommendation a physician makes, should be in the best interest of the patient and not a combination of the patient's interest and the financial interest of the doctor,\" said Jena, associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\"If we lived in a different world where none of these payments to physicians occurred, how many fewer Americans would have [been prescribed] opioids, and how many fewer deaths would have occurred?\" he asked.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2015, more than 183,000 people in the United States died from overdoses related to prescription opioids, according to the CDC . In October, President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency\n\nAt least one company has decided to stop paying doctors for promotional activities such as speaking engagements.\n\nPurdue Pharma discontinued its speakers program for the opioids OxyContin and Butrans at the end of 2016 and the program for Hysingla, another opioid, in November, according to company spokesman Robert Josephson.\n\n\"We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,\" a company statement said.\n\nMore than $1 million in three years\n\nThough Thiyagarajah's opioid prescription rates were particularly high, many other doctors who have prescribed large amounts of opioids have also been paid large amounts of money by pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs.\n\nSeveral patients have filed lawsuits against these high prescribers.\n\nFrom August 2013 through December 2016, Dr. Steven Simon of Overland Park, Kansas, was paid nearly $1.1 million by companies that make opioid painkillers, according to the federal Open Payments database\n\nMost of the payments were fees for speaking, training and education.\n\nBallou, one of his patients, says she remembers Simon bragging about how drug companies were flying him across the country to give lectures to other doctors.\n\n\"He said he was going to Miami, and they were going to give him a convertible, and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food he'd ever had,\" said Ballou, who filed a lawsuit against Simon after she says she became addicted to opioids.\n\nSimon's lawyer, James Wyrsch, said he would not comment on pending litigation.\n\nIn court documents, he asked for the case to be dismissed, saying in part that Ballou's complaints that Simon improperly prescribed Subsys were \"simply incorrect.\"\n\nBridget Patton, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City field office, said federal agents went to the office where Simon works, Mid-America PolyClinic, in July.\n\nThe clinic said in a statement that it is \"fully and willingly cooperating with all investigations\" and that Simon has not been employed there since July 24.\n\n\"We had a lawful presence at that facility,\" Patton said. She declined to say whether investigating Simon himself was the purpose of the FBI visit.\n\nThe owner of the pain clinic, Dr. Srinivas Nalamachu, told The Kansas City Star that the agents showed up with a search warrant for Simon's medical records involving fentanyl prescriptions.\n\nSimon and his lawyer told CNN they couldn't comment due to the pending litigation.\n\nBallou said that when she was Simon's patient, it didn't give her pause that the same doctor who was prescribing opioids to her was also taking money from the companies that made the drugs.\n\nBut now she looks back with anger.\n\nA Mother's Day card Angela Cantone's daugher made for her reads, \"Best of all mother likes to sleep,\" alluding to the many instances when Cantone says her opioid medication caused her to pass out.\n\nCantone, the patient who went to Thiyagarajah, the pain specialist in South Carolina, looks back with sadness.\n\nShe cries as she remembers the Mother's Day card her daughter made her in preschool. The teacher asked each child what their mother liked to do and wrote it on the card.\n\nHer card said her mother liked to sleep.\n\n\"Instead of saying 'she gives me hugs and kisses or takes me to the park,' it was the years of her finding me on the floor,\" Cantone said. \"I feel like I failed as a parent.\"\n\nShe becomes angry when she thinks about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her doctor was paid by the drug company.\n\n\"The medication that was being prescribed to me was for his benefit, not my own,\" she said.",

    "text": "(CNN) California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna.\n\n\"If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records, that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law,\" he said.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurance provider with 23.1 million customers, told CNN it looked forward to \"explaining our clinical review process\" to the commissioner.\n\nThe California probe centers on a deposition by Dr. Jay Ken Iinuma, who served as medical director for Aetna for Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015, according to the insurer.\n\nDuring the deposition, the doctor said he was following Aetna's training, in which nurses reviewed records and made recommendations to him.\n\nJones said his expectation would be \"that physicians would be reviewing treatment authorization requests,\" and that it's troubling that \"during the entire course of time he was employed at Aetna, he never once looked at patients' medical records himself.\"\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that in that entire course in time, there weren't any cases in which a decision about the denial of coverage ought to have been made by someone trained as a physician, as opposed to some other licensed professional,\" Jones told CNN.\n\n\"That's why we've contacted Aetna and asked that they provide us information about how they are making these claims decisions and why we've opened this investigation.\"\n\nThe insurance commissioner said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by Aetna's decisions should contact his office\n\nMembers of the medical community expressed similar shock, saying Iinuma's deposition leads to questions about Aetna's practices across the country.\n\n\"Oh my God. Are you serious? That is incredible,\" said Dr. Anne-Marie Irani when told of the medical director's testimony. Irani is a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU and a former member of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology's board of directors.\n\n\"This is potentially a huge, huge story and quite frankly may reshape how insurance functions,\" said Dr. Andrew Murphy, who, like Irani, is a renowned fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. He recently served on the academy's board of directors.\n\nThe Gillen Washington case\n\nGillen Washington, 23, says he hopes to force change at Aetna.\n\nThe deposition by Aetna's former medical director came as part of a lawsuit filed against Aetna by a college student who suffers from a rare immune disorder. The case is expected to go to trial later this week in California Superior Court.\n\nGillen Washington, 23, is suing Aetna for breach of contract and bad faith, saying he was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when he was 19. His suit alleges Aetna's \"reckless withholding of benefits almost killed him.\"\n\nAetna has rejected the allegations, saying Washington failed to comply with their requests for blood work. Washington, who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID, in high school, became a new Aetna patient in January 2014 after being insured by Kaiser.\n\nAetna initially paid for his treatments after each infusion, which can cost up to $20,000. But when Washington's clinic asked Aetna to pre-authorize a November 2014 infusion, Aetna says it was obligated to review his medical record. That's when it saw his last blood work had been done three years earlier for Kaiser.\n\nDespite being told by his own doctor's office that he needed to come in for new blood work, Washington failed to do so for several months until he got so sick he ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung.\n\nOnce his blood was tested, Aetna resumed covering his infusions and pre-certified him for a year. Despite that, according to Aetna, Washington continued to miss infusions.\n\nWashington's suit counters that Aetna ignored his treating physician, who appealed on his behalf months before his hospitalization that the treatment was medically necessary \"to prevent acute and long-term problems.\"\n\n\"Aetna is blaming me for what happened,\" Washington told CNN. \"I'll just be honest, it's infuriating to me. I want Aetna to be made to change.\"\n\nDuring his videotaped deposition in October 2016, Iinuma -- who signed the pre-authorization denial -- said he never read Washington's medical records and knew next to nothing about his disorder.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin can cost as much as $20,000 per treatment. It helps patients like Gillen Washington stave off infection.\n\nQuestioned about Washington's condition, Iinuma said he wasn't sure what the drug of choice would be for people who suffer from his condition.\n\nIinuma further says he's not sure what the symptoms are for the disorder or what might happen if treatment is suddenly stopped for a patient.\n\n\"Do I know what happens?\" the doctor said. \"Again, I'm not sure. ... I don't treat it.\"\n\nIinuma said he never looked at a patient's medical records while at Aetna. He says that was Aetna protocol and that he based his decision off \"pertinent information\" provided to him by a nurse.\n\n\"Did you ever look at medical records?\" Scott Glovsky, Washington's attorney, asked Iinuma in the deposition.\n\n\"No, I did not,\" the doctor says, shaking his head.\n\n\"So as part of your custom and practice in making decisions, you would rely on what the nurse had prepared for you?\" Glovsky asks.\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\nIinuma said nearly all of his work was conducted online. Once in a while, he said, he might place a phone call to the nurse for more details.\n\nHow many times might he call a nurse over the course of a month?\n\n\"Zero to one,\" he said.\n\nGlovsky told CNN he had \"never heard such explosive testimony in two decades of deposing insurance company review doctors.\"\n\nAetna's response\n\nAetna defended Iinuma, who is no longer with the company, saying in its legal brief that he relied on his \"years of experience\" as a trained physician in making his decision about Washington's treatment and that he was following Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletin appropriately.\n\n\"Dr. Iinuma's decision was correct,\" Aetna said in court papers. \"Plaintiff has asserted throughout this litigation that Dr. Iinuma had no medical basis for his decision that 2011 lab tests were outdated and that Dr. Iinuma's decision was incorrect. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts.\"\n\nGillen Washington receives an infusion of the medicine needed to boost his immune system. He calls it \"the magic juice.\"\n\nIn its trial brief, Aetna said: \"Given that Aetna does not directly provide medical care to its members, Aetna needs to obtain medical records from members and their doctors to evaluate whether services are 'medically necessary.' Aetna employs nurses to gather the medical records and coordinate with the offices of treating physicians, and Aetna employs doctors to make the actual coverage-related determinations.\n\n\"In addition to applying their clinical judgment, the Aetna doctors and nurses use Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletins ('CPBs') to determine what medical records to request, and whether those records satisfy medical necessity criteria to support coverage. These CPBs reflect the current standard of care in the medical community. They are frequently updated, and are publicly available for any treating physician to review.\"\n\nJones, the California insurance commissioner, said he couldn't comment specifically on Washington's case, but what drew his interest was the medical director's admission of not looking at patients' medical records.\n\n\"What I'm responding to is the portion of his deposition transcript in which he said as the medical director, he wasn't actually reviewing medical records,\" Jones told CNN.\n\nHe said his investigation will review every individual denial of coverage or pre-authorization during the medical director's tenure to determine \"whether it was appropriate or not for that decision to be made by someone other than a physician.\"\n\nIf the probe determines that violations occurred, he said, California insurance code sets monetary penalties for each individual violation.\n\nCNN has made numerous phone calls to Iinuma's office for comment but has not heard back. Heather Richardson, an attorney representing Aetna, declined to answer any questions.\n\nAsked about the California investigation, Aetna gave this written statement to CNN:\n\n\"We have yet to hear from Commissioner Jones but look forward to explaining our clinical review process.\n\n\"Aetna medical directors are trained to review all available medical information -- including medical records -- to make an informed decision. As part of our review process, medical directors are provided all submitted medical records, and also receive a case synopsis and review performed by a nurse.\n\n\"Medical directors -- and all of our clinicians -- take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously. Similar to most other clinical environments, our medical directors work collaboratively with our nurses who are involved in these cases and factor in their input as part of the decision-making process.\"\n\nGillen Washington became emaciated and gravely ill after four months without treatment.\n\n'A huge admission'\n\nDr. Arthur Caplan, founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, described Iinuma's testimony as \"a huge admission of fundamental immorality.\"\n\n\"People desperate for care expect at least a fair review by the payer. This reeks of indifference to patients,\" Caplan said, adding the testimony shows there \"needs to be more transparency and accountability\" from private, for-profit insurers in making these decisions.\n\nMurphy, the former American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology board member, said he was \"shocked\" and \"flabbergasted\" by the medical director's admission.\n\n\"This is something that all of us have long suspected, but to actually have an Aetna medical director admit he hasn't even looked at medical records, that's not good,\" said Murphy, who runs an allergy and immunology practice west of Philadelphia.\n\n\"If he has not looked at medical records or engaged the prescribing physician in a conversation -- and decisions were made without that input -- then yeah, you'd have to question every single case he reviewed.\"\n\nMurphy said when he and other doctors seek a much-needed treatment for a patient, they expect the medical director of an insurance company to have considered every possible factor when deciding on the best option for care.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"We run into the prior authorization issues when we are renewing therapy, when the patient's insurance changes or when an insurance company changes requirements,\" he said.\n\n\"Dealing with these denials is very time consuming.

    "text": "(CNN) You're out late at night and you've had one too many drinks. You're feeling a bit inebriated, and you're wondering if a cup of coffee can help. Many of us have been there.\n\nWell, here's the lowdown: While a cup of joe or shot of espresso can help to perk you up, it's not going to help sober you up. In fact, in some situations, the combination of caffeine and alcohol could be potentially harmful.\n\n\"I call it the 'perfect storm,' \" said Dr. Mary Claire O'Brien, senior associate dean for health care education at the Wake Forest School of Medicine, who has researched the interactions between caffeine and alcohol, including its effects on injury risk.\n\nHow alcohol and caffeine are metabolized\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant, so it can make you more alert and possibly improve your performance to some extent, according to Dr. Robert Swift, associate director of the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addition Studies. Specifically, caffeine interferes with the action of a chemical known as adenosine. \"Adenosine tends to be sedative ... and one of the signals to fall asleep is that adenosine builds up in the brain,\" Swift said. By blocking the action of adenosine, caffeine has the ability to make you feel less tired, Swift explained.\n\nInterestingly, alcohol can trigger the release of dopamine, which results in a stimulant effect when you first start drinking, though this does not necessarily mean you are any less impaired from alcohol, according to Swift.\n\nAlcohol's sedative effects tend to kick in after blood alcohol levels peak and then start to fall. Specifically, alcohol promotes the release of the brain chemical GABA, which produces sedation, Swift explained. Alcohol also blocks the action of glutamate, a brain chemical that stimulates nerve cells, and this blockade can also produce sedation. During this time, you might feel tired, and in need of a pick-me-up.\n\nAlcohol and caffeine: A potentially dangerous combination\n\nConsuming caffeine might make you feel less sleepy when drinking alcohol, but it will not accelerate alcohol metabolism or ameliorate its effects, experts say. Mixing the two is also a practice that the US Dietary Guidelines cautions against\n\nA major concern when seeking out coffee or any source of caffeine in an effort to feel awake after a few drinks, is that by making you feel less tired, you may think you are less inebriated than you actually are.\n\n\"Even if someone feels like the caffeine causes them to feel more awake and less sluggish, they still need to be aware that the alcohol is still metabolizing in the same way and on the same timeframe as if they haven't had any caffeine ... which means that its effects can still be potentially dangerous,\" said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\n\"Someone may think, 'I can drive now' ... they see a car stop suddenly, and they have to put their foot on the brake quickly, but reaction time could be slow,\" Swift said. \"What you feel is [linked to] a different part of your brain that is the motor system that controls reaction time.\"\n\n\"Your blood alcohol concentration won't be reversed by caffeine,\" Swift added. That means people feel less tired from alcohol when they drink coffee, \"but they are not any less impaired,\" Swift explained.\n\nIn one study involving close to 130 adult drinkers, alcohol negatively affected reaction time and resulted in more crashes during a simulated driving test, but drinking caffeinated beer didn't improve people's ability to drive\n\nIn addition to the fact that consuming caffeine while drinking won't make you any sharper behind the wheel, there also is no evidence that consuming caffeine while drinking would improve your judgment in social situations, according to Swift.\n\nWhat's more, by making you feel less tired or sedated, you may be inclined to consume more alcohol than you otherwise would. \"If you take caffeine with your alcohol, people drink more,\" Swift said. \"The usual signal where people would say 'I've had enough' is no longer there.\"\n\n\"Caffeine permits you to stay awake longer than you would have otherwise -- and therefore drink for a longer amount of time,\" O'Brien added. \"I had the experience of taking care of a young man who was extremely intoxicated, and almost on a ventilator ... he said had been drinking Red Bull and J\u00e4germeister. When I asked why he was mixing alcohol and caffeine, he said, 'So I can stay drunk longer,' \" O'Brien said.\n\nThe marketing and sale of premixed beverages containing alcohol and caffeine has been particularly concerning among experts. But there has been a positive outcome: O'Brien's research examining injury associated with these caffeinated malt beverages (dubbed \"AEDs, or \"alcoholic energy drinks\") contributed to the successful removal of these beverages from the market in 2010.\n\n\"The FDA put the kibosh on that, because of the negative public health implications,\" Swift said.\n\nStrategies for sobering up\n\nExperts say the only way to sober up is to let time pass. The specific time it will take for alcohol to leave your system depends on the individual, but on average, people metabolize about one drink per hour. \"If you've had five drinks, it would take about five hours to get the alcohol totally out of your system,\" Swift said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut an even better strategy is to prevent intoxication in the first place. Experts say drinking with food in your stomach can slow the rise of alcohol in your bloodstream, which can make you less impaired than if you drank on an empty stomach.\n\nAlternating alcoholic beverages with seltzer or water is another helpful strategy. It won't slow the absorption of alcohol in the body or make you less inebriated, but \"water will help keep one hydrated ... and can potentially decrease the amount of alcohol someone drinks,\" Majumdar said.",

    "text": "(CNN) Have you ever wondered why some people seem to stay trim effortlessly, while the majority of Americans struggle with their weight?\n\nSure, genetics and a healthy lifestyle play a large role, but there are other, more surprising correlations that may be helping them stay slim.\n\nThey live near a gym.\n\nThe study was observational, so it does not prove cause and effect, but it does reinforce the impact of the built environment, including city design, on body weight.\n\nOther research has found that more walkable neighborhoods are also associated with lower weight.\n\nThe Lancet study also found an effect, albeit weaker, on proximity to fast food restaurants: Study subjects who lived 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) or farther from a fast food outlet versus within half a kilometer (a third of a mile) were slimmer, especially women.\n\nThey fidget a lot.\n\nA review article nearly a decade ago found that people with the highest levels of spontaneous physical activity , including fidgeting, tend to weigh less.\n\nAlthough fidgeting has a strong genetic and biological component, increasing non-exercise-related physical activity -- including walking, standing, cooking and even gardening -- can also play a significant role in keeping people trim.\n\nThis type of non-exercise activity makes up a significant and modifiable portion of your total daily calorie burning, and it can play an important role in helping you stay lean. It is even more important in our modern environment, filled with labor-saving devices, televisions and technology.\n\nA 2003 study found that the impact of mechanization and labor-saving devices, including dishwashers, washing machines, escalators and cars utilized in driving to work, led to a 111-calorie reduction in daily energy expenditure. Unless this reduction is offset by increased activity, it could lead to significant weight gain over time.\n\nThey eat spicy food.\n\nIf you pay closer attention, you may notice that your naturally slim friends are the ones dousing their meals with extra-spicy hot sauce or eating hot chili peppers regularly. This may not be a coincidence. Observational data show that eating spicier foods is associated with less obesity.\n\nA recent review article summarizes the growing body of research showing that capsaicin, a major bioactive compound present in chili peppers, may play a role in weight control in several ways, including reducing appetite, activating heat-generating and calorie-burning brown fat, increasing the use of fat as fuel and modestly increasing metabolism.\n\nIn addition, spicy food seems to keep people healthier. A very large Chinese study found that those who ate spicy food six to seven times per week versus once or less per week were 14% less likely to die from any cause\n\nNumerous other spices including cumin, ginger, rosemary, oregano, cinnamon and turmeric may also play a role in helping you stay slim by reducing inflammation, improving your body's response to insulin and improving the composition of bacteria in your gut. (I should disclose that I wrote about weight and health benefits of spices, including spice-filled recipes, in my new book, \" Spice Up, Slim Down \").\n\nThey live at a higher elevation.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Colorado has the lowest rate of obesity in the United States, and there may be a good reason why: the altitude.\n\nA 2013 article in the International Journal of Obesity found lower obesity rates in those living at higher elevations.\n\nColorado has the lowest rate of obesity in the United States.\n\nBoth men and women living at less than 500 meters (1,640 feet) above sea level had a 5.1 and 3.9 times, respectively, higher odds of being obese compared with their counterparts living at 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) or greater above sea level, after controlling for demographics and lifestyle.\n\nThose living at 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) had more modest, but still significant, 7.5% lower odds of being obese. The study's authors suggest that lower oxygen levels, higher metabolic demands at higher altitudes and increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system (which may reduce appetite) are all possible causes of this finding, but a definitive explanation has yet to be fully established.\n\nThey live in a big city.\n\nThe study that looked at elevation and weight also found that people who lived in big cities, defined as metro counties with a population of 1 million or greater, had a significantly lower risk of obesity compared with those living in smaller metro, non-metro or rural counties.\n\nThe authors suggest that food security, increased walkability of larger metro areas and better diet may explain these findings.\n\nBut their conclusions are contradicted by other studies that have shown urbanization may lead to obesity , especially in children and low-income populations.\n\nAccording to the Harvard School for Public Health, this is probably due to increased access to high-calorie foods (especially fast food), more passive transportation (less walking), less open space, more mass media marketing of unhealthy foods and less work-related physical activity.\n\nBut even if you don't fall into those categories ...\n\nI don't expect you to move to the mountains of Nepal to stay slim, but spicing up your diet and making an effort to move more on a daily basis could certainly help.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnd if you don't live in a big city or near an exercise facility, a healthy lifestyle -- including daily exercise, less sedentary behavior, better sleep and a healthful diet -- will help keep you lean, regardless of your environment.",

    "text": "(CNN) You may be aware that a plant-based diet can make you healthier by lowering your risk for obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Now, a study suggests there's another good reason to regularly eat meatless meals. By filling your plate with plant foods instead of animal foods, you can help save the planet.\n\nThe study, published last week in the journal Nature, found that as a result of population growth and the continued consumption of Western diets high in red meats and processed foods, the environmental pressures of the food system could increase by up to 90% by 2050, \"exceeding key planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity beyond which Earth's vital ecosystems could become unstable,\" according to study author Marco Springmann of the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food at the University of Oxford.\n\n\"It could lead to dangerous levels of climate change with higher occurrences of extreme weather events, affect the regulatory function of forest ecosystems and biodiversity ... and pollute water bodies such that it would lead to more oxygen-depleted dead zones in oceans,\" Springmann said.\n\n\"If the whole world, which continues to grow, eats more like us, the impacts are staggering, and the planet simply can't withstand it,\" said Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian nutritionist and plant-based food and sustainability expert in Los Angeles who was not involved in the new research.\n\nSustaining a healthier planet will require halving the amount of food loss and waste, and improving farming practices and technologies. But it will also require a shift toward more plant-based diets, according to Springmann.\n\nAs Palmer noted, \"research consistently shows that drastically reducing animal food intake and mostly eating plant foods is one of the most powerful things you can do to reduce your impact on the planet over your lifetime, in terms of energy required, land used, greenhouse gas emissions, water used and pollutants produced.\"\n\nHow a meat-based diet negatively affects the environment\n\nIt might come as a surprise, but Springmann's study found that the production of animal products generates the majority of food-related greenhouse-gas emissions -- specifically, up to 78% of total agricultural emissions.\n\nThis, he explained, is due to manure-related emissions, to their \"low feed-conversion efficiencies\" (meaning cows and other animals are not efficient in converting what they eat into body weight) and to enteric fermentation in ruminants, a process that takes place in a cow's stomach when it digests food that leads to methane emissions.\n\nThe feed-related impacts of animal products also contribute to freshwater use and pressures on cropland, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus application, which over time could lead to dead zones in oceans, low-oxygen areas where few organisms can survive, according to Springmann.\n\nFor an example of how animal foods compare with plant-based foods in terms of environmental effects, consider that \"beef is more than 100 times as emissions-intensive as legumes,\" Springmann said. \"This is because a cow needs, on average, 10 kilograms of feed, often from grains, to grow 1 kilogram of body weight, and that feed will have required water, land and fertilizer inputs to grow.\"\n\nIn addition, cows emit the potent greenhouse gas methane during digestion, which makes cows and other ruminants such as sheep especially high-emitting.\n\nOther animal foods have lower impacts because they don't produce methane in their stomachs and require less feed than cows, Springmann explained. For example, cows emit about 10 times more greenhouse gases per kilogram of meat than pigs and chickens, which themselves emit about 10 times more than legumes.\n\nLike animals, plants also require inputs from the environment in order to grow, but the magnitude is significantly less, Springmann explained.\n\n\"In today's agricultural system, we grow plants to feed animals, which require all of those resources and inputs: land, water, fossil fuels, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer to grow. And then we feed plants to animals and care for them over their lifetime, while they produce methane and manure,\" Palmer said.\n\nAdopting more plant-based diets for ourselves could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the food system by more than half, according to the Nature study. A mainly plant-based diet could also reduce other environmental impacts, such as those from fertilizers, and save up to quarter use of both farmland and fresh water, according to Springmann.\n\nPalmer explained that \"legumes [or pulses], such as beans, lentils and peas are the most sustainable protein source on the planet. They require very small amounts of water to grow, they can grow in harsh, dry climates, they grow in poor nations, providing food security, and they act like a natural fertilizer, capturing nitrogen from the air and fixing it in the soil. Thus, there is less need for synthetic fertilizers. These are the types of protein sources we need to rely upon more often.\"\n\nFlexitarian: The healthy compromise for you and the planet\n\nExperts agree that if you are not ready to give up meat entirely, a flexitarian diet, which is predominantly plant-based, can help. This diet includes plenty of fruits, vegetables and plant-based protein sources including legumes, soybeans and nuts, along with modest amounts of poultry, fish, milk and eggs, and small amounts of red meat.\n\nVegetarian and vegan diets would result in even lower greenhouse gas emissions, but a flexitarian diet \"is the least stringent that is both healthy and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough for us to stay within environmental limits,\" according to Springmann.\n\nPalmer said that \"although vegan diets, followed by vegetarian diets, are linked with the lowest environmental impacts, not everyone is interested in taking on those lifestyles. But everyone can eat more of a flexitarian diet. It doesn't mean that you have to give up meat completely, but you significantly reduce your intake of it.\"\n\nRegistered dietitian nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner described it this way: \"A flexitarian is really someone who wakes up with the intention of being more vegetarian. It's different from vegetarian in that there is some flexibility.\"\n\nGoing flexitarian\n\nJust how \"flexitarian\" you wish to be can be flexible, too. For example, Blatner, who was not involved in the Nature study, offers three levels of the diet in her book \"The Flexitarian Diet\": a \"beginner\" flexitarian, who consumes six to eight meatless meals per week (or is limited to 26 ounces of animal protein); an \"advanced\" flexitarian, who eats nine to 14 meatless meals per week (or is limited to 18 ounces of animal protein); and an \"expert\" flexitarian, who eats at least 15 meatless meals or limits animal protein to 9 ounces per week.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe key is not just eliminating meat but swapping in plant-based proteins, including beans and lentils. A Mediterranean meal might incorporate chickpeas; a Mexican meal might have black beans or pintos; an Asian meal might include edamame; an Italian meal might use white beans or lentils to make a \"Bolognese\" pasta sauce, Blatner explained.\n\n\"I wrote the book because I really wanted to be a vegetarian, but I just couldn't do it so strictly,\" she said. \"I really wanted to lean in to a more plant-based diet, but I needed a little more flexibility. So it's the great compromise.\"\n\nFlexitarian fast-start\n\nTo get started on a flexitarian diet, here's a sample three-day plan, courtesy of Blatner. You'll notice that some meals have a choice of a plant-based protein or an animal-based protein. Choose plant as often as you can, and you'll soon be an expert-level flexitarian of 15-plus meatless meals per week.\n\nDay 1\n\nBreakfast of avocado toast: sprouted whole-grain toast + avocado + spinach + egg\n\nLunch of kale ranch bowl: chicken or chickpeas + chopped kale/tomatoes + roasted sweet potato cubes + ranch dressing\n\nDinner of tacos: seasoned white fish or lentils + corn tortillas + cabbage slaw + guacamole + salsa\n\nSnack of apple + pecans and/or cucumber + hummus\n\nDay 2\n\nBreakfast of peanut butter oatmeal: oatmeal + natural peanut butter + chopped apple\n\nLunch of a Mexican bowl: chicken or black beans + chopped romaine/peppers + brown rice + guacamole + salsa\n\nDinner of a Mediterranean plate: chicken or chickpeas + cucumber/tomato/feta salad + lemon-dill brown rice\n\nSnack of grape tomatoes + mozzarella stick and/or clementine + pistachios\n\nDay 3\n\nBreakfast of green belly smoothie: 2% plain kefir + rolled oats + banana + spinach\n\nLunch of Asian bowl: chicken or edamame + coleslaw mix + quinoa + ginger dressing\n\nDinner of burgers: beef or bean burger + sweet potato fries + veggie dippers with ranch\n\nSnack of carrots + almond butter and/or dark chocolate + berries",

    "text": "(CNN) When I reflect on my childhood baking memories, one that stands out is a tray of warm chocolate chip cookies coming out of the oven. It was so tempting to eat the raw dough while making them -- talk about a lesson in delayed gratification -- but in 20 or so minutes, delicious buttery, sugary cookies dotted with chocolate chips would be ready to enjoy.\n\nNever mind fancy desserts; chocolate chip cookies have always been one of my favorite treats. And if you are like me and find them irresistible, you probably can't stop after a few bites.\n\n\"Even today, after eating and living with them for 40 years, I still can't stop eating them,\" said Kathleen King, founder of Tate's Bake Shop in Southampton, New York, and creator of the top-rated chocolate chip cookie according to Consumer Reports. \"I am either eating no cookies, or I am eating several. I can't have one.\"\n\nBut what exactly makes chocolate chip cookies so universally craved in the first place?\n\nThe emotional attachment to chocolate chip cookies\n\n\"I think a lot of it has to do with the connection to our past, whether it was a grandmother, a mother, a place visited, a summer home or family time. It's also usually the first cookie every child learned how to make, and so I think there's a tremendous emotional attachment and remembrance with the chocolate chip cookie,\" King said. \"Lifestyles are changing, but that connection is still hanging on.\"\n\nEating chocolate chip cookies can be associated with a range of emotions. \"If I'm celebrating, I can have a couple of cookies, but if I'm sad, I want 10 cookies,\" she said. \"While the cookie is in your mouth, that moment is happiness -- and then it's gone, and you're sad again, and you have another one.\"\n\nThe happiness that comes from sharing homemade chocolate chip cookies cannot be underestimated. King, who started baking chocolate chip cookies and selling them when she was 11 years old, said her biggest motivator for baking them was the joy they brought other people. \"That really made me happy -- and probably, a lot of people that bake will say the same thing: Sharing [chocolate chip cookies] makes people happy.\"\n\nAddictive ingredients\n\nAside from the emotional comfort that chocolate chip cookies may provide, there may be scientific explanations for why we salivate for them. Some research suggests that ingredients in chocolate chip cookies may have additive properties. Take sugar: Evidence in humans shows that sugar and sweetness can induce rewards and cravings comparable in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs , including cocaine.\n\nA traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for \u00be cup of granulated sugar and \u00be cup of brown sugar, yielding 10 grams, or 2.5 teaspoons, of sugar per cookie.\n\nThen there's the chocolate, which, in addition to sugar, contains small amounts of a compound known as anandamide. Interestingly, anandamide is also a brain chemical that targets the same cell receptors as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient in marijuana that is responsible for its mood-altering effects. That's not to say chocolate will produce the same \"high\" as marijuana, but there may be a chemical basis for the pleasure we get from eating chocolate.\n\nAccording to Gary Wenk, director of neuroscience undergraduate programs at the Ohio State University and author of \"Your Brain on Food,\" high-fat, sugar-rich cookies will raise the level of anandamide in our brains independent of what's in the cookie, because it's our body's response to eating such a tasty item. \"The fat and sugar combine to induce our addiction as much as does the anandamide,\" Wenk said. \"It's a triple play of delight.\"\n\nTexture and flavor: Key to a cookie's addictive characteristics\n\nAll of this science may sound intriguing, but the simplest explanation for why chocolate chip cookies are so delectable may have to do with the mix of ingredients that combine in a way that appeals to our senses.\n\n\"A chocolate chip cookie is a brilliant contrast among the flavors and among the textures,\" said Gail Vance Civille, founder and president of Sensory Spectrum, a consulting firm that helps companies learn how sensory cues drive consumer perceptions of products.\n\nThe flavor of chocolate chip cookies, according to Civille, is \"a beautiful amalgam of caramelized butter and sugar,\" the result of the browning of butter and caramelizing of sugar while it bakes. The combination of the toasted grain with the browned butter, caramelized sugar, vanilla and chocolate are \"the beautiful rich flavors that blend together in a chocolate chip cookie,\" she said. And as the chocolate melts, it becomes more aromatic and punches up the flavor.\n\nIt sounds counterintuitive, but salt is important too, even in sweet treats. \"It is what adds interest to food, even if it's a sweet food, because it makes the sugar and other ingredients taste better and come together better,\" Civille said. \"A pinch of salt in cookies really makes a difference, and it enhances sweetness a little bit.\"\n\nKing noted that \"with Tate's, we were the first to do the thin and crisp, which is kind of an addictive mouthfeel, and we were also the first to do a little bit heaver on the salt. People don't even put salt in cookies, but [without salt], it tastes flat.\"\n\nOther secrets to making delicious chocolate chip cookies include using butter instead of shortening or margarine; brown sugar, which has a molasses-like quality to it; and pure vanilla, according to King. A high-quality flour and a really good chocolate chip are also important.\n\nThe texture of chocolate chip cookies also plays a big role in their appeal. \"Just on the texture side, [the chocolate chip cookie] has a lot going for it,\" Civille said.\n\n\"Every bite will be interesting. ... You will hit the cookie, which has crispness due to air pockets in the cookie crumb, and then the chocolate, which is dense and uniform when you bite through it. It's like a symphony orchestra playing together. ... It's very harmonious,\" she said.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to test whether the flavor and texture of chocolate chip cookies are \"addictive enough\" is to observe people eating them.\n\n\"When I would create any product, if I put it out as a sample to my staff and if I didn't watch them unconsciously go back and take some more, then I felt it wasn't good enough. There's a lot of good, but I didn't want good. I wanted that addictive thing,\" King said.\n\nPersonal preferences\n\nAlthough there are some universally appealing qualities of chocolate chip cookies that make them so addictive, specific preferences may vary from person to person. One may crave chocolate chip cookies that are soft and gooey; another may long for crispy, crunchy cookies.\n\nMost people prefer semisweet chips, which have a soft melting quality that can lend itself to a more addictive mouthfeel with the crunchy caramelized cookie, according to King. But some may opt for milk chocolate, and others may like the taste of bittersweet chocolate in their cookies.\n\nThe optimal ratio of chocolate chips to cookie is also a personal preference. \"I'll put a bag on the table, and my husband will turn them over and look for the least amount of chips, but I'll look for the most,\" King said.\n\nA happy indulgence\n\nWhatever one's individual chocolate chip cookie preference -- or \"addiction\" -- it's fair to say that these beloved cookies can have a place in a balanced diet, as long as you are willing to keep portions in check.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"The main thing is not to think of food as good food and bad food. It's all good. It's how much you eat of it,\" King said. \"I used to be overweight, and I had that in my mind, if I ate a cookie, that was bad and now the day is ruined, instead of just, 'that's cool.' \"\n\nSo whether it feels like a true \"addiction\" or not, indulging in a chocolate chip cookie or two should be a happy experience.",

    "text": "(CNN) Eating an egg a day may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease, a study of more than 400,000 adults in China suggests.\n\nDaily egg eaters had an 18% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which manifests as heart attacks and strokes, compared with adults who avoided eggs, according to the research published Monday in the journal Heart.\n\nCommonly called heart disease, cardiovascular disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias and heart valve problems in addition to strokes and attacks. Raised blood pressure, carrying too much weight or obesity, and elevated blood sugar all contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is triggered by unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking and harmful use of alcohol.\n\n'Controversial' nutrition source\n\nIn the past, doctors sometimes warned patients to avoid eating too many eggs\n\nThough eggs contain high-quality protein and other positive nutritional components, they also have high amounts of cholesterol, which was thought might be harmful, explained Canqing Yu , a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing.\n\nYet \"existing studies on the association between egg and cardiovascular diseases are controversial due to small sample size and limited information,\" Yu wrote in an email. Past studies have provided only limited evidence from the Chinese population, \"which have huge differences in dietary habits, lifestyle behaviors and diseases patterns,\" Yu said.\n\nThese are among the reasons why he and his colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease.\n\nTo begin, they used information from an ongoing study of half a million adults living in 10 regions of China. They concentrated on 416,213 participants who'd never been diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes.\n\nSlightly more than 13% of these adults, ranging in age from 30 to 79, said they ate about an egg a day while just over 9% reported never or very rarely enjoying an egg. Nearly all the participants ate chicken, not duck, eggs, Yu noted.\n\nOver nearly nine years, the research team tracked this select group. They focused on major coronary events, such as heart attacks and strokes , including hemorrhagic strokes -- when a blood vessel bursts in the brain due, usually, to uncontrolled high blood pressure -- and ischemic strokes -- when a blood vessel feeding the brain becomes blocked, usually by a blood clot.\n\n\"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths in China, which accounted for half of the total mortality,\" Yu said. \"Stroke, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, is the first cause of premature death, followed by ischemic heart disease.\"\n\nDuring follow-up, 9,985 people died of cardiovascular disease, and an additional 5,103 major coronary events occurred. Nearly 84,000 other participants were diagnosed with heart disease in this time period.\n\nAnalyzing the data, the researchers found that eating about an egg a day related to a lower risk of heart disease compared with not eating eggs.\n\nIn fact, participants who ate up to one egg daily had a 26% lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which is more common in China than in the United States or other high-income countries. Additionally, the egg eaters had a 28% lower risk of dying from this type of stroke.\n\nFinally, egg eaters also enjoyed a 12% reduced risk of ischemic heart disease, which is diagnosed in those who show the early signs of gridlocked blood flow to the brain.\n\nBased on the results, Yu said, eating eggs in moderation -- less than one a day -- is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, especially hemorrhagic stroke. Even more, the new research is \"by far the most powerful project to detect such an effect,\" he said.\n\nOn the downside, the research team collected only \"crude information\" about egg consumption from participants, and this prevented them from estimating effects \"more precisely,\" Yu said. \"We should [also] be cautious when interpreting our results in a context of different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from China.\"\n\nPart of a healthy diet\n\nCaroline Richard, an assistant professor of agricultural life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said the new study is simply observational and so cannot show a direct cause and effect between eating eggs and risk of heart disease.\n\n\"Saying that, this is a very large study, and that in itself is a strength, and the researchers have done the best possible job to control for other factors,\" said Richard, who was not involved in the research.\n\nHer own systematic review of studies showed that when participants are provided with between six and 12 eggs a week, no change occurs in major cardiovascular risk factors, including higher rates of blood sugar, inflammation and cholesterol.\n\n\"Several studies in our review observed a positive effect of egg consumption on HDL cholesterol,\" or \"good\" cholesterol, she added.\n\nThe new study, then, \"delivers a similar message\" that \"egg consumption does not increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease,\" Richard said.\n\nSome studies have suggested that consuming eggs increases the risk of diabetes, she said.\n\n\"In this study however, they didn't assess the risk of developing diabetes, which may be because diabetes is a newer disease in the Chinese population and there is not good documentation of who has it,\" Richard said. Still, she noted, \"this will be very important data for helping develop dietary prevention guidelines in China.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCardiovascular disease, which takes the lives of 17.7 million people every year, is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization . Cardiovascular disease causes nearly a third -- 31% -- of all global deaths each year.\n\n\"Overall, I would say that consuming egg as part of a healthy diet does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and we now have another carefully done study to support that,\" Richard said.",

    "text": "(CNN) Maybe there's no need for a fountain of youth after all. New research suggests that cutting calories by 15% for two years can slow the metabolic process that leads to aging and protect against age-related diseases.\n\nAfter just one year on a reduced-calorie diet, study participants saw their metabolic rates drop significantly. The lowered rate continued into the second year and led to an overall decrease in oxidative stress, a process that has been tied to diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions.\n\n\"Reducing calorie intake provides health benefits to all people regardless of their current health status,\" said Leanne M. Redman, lead author of the study and an associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University.\n\nAnimal studies have shown that restricting calories by 25% can extend life. The new CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study was designed by Redman, her colleagues and the National Institute on Aging to answer a simple question: Would the same be true in humans?\n\nAging biomarkers\n\nDuring the first phase, teams of researchers ran small-scale pilot experiments to answer a variety of questions including, what kind of calorie restriction could study participants actually stick to? To this end, some of the pilot studies tested a diet-only calorie reduction, others tested exercise only, and still others tested half-diet, half-exercise.\n\nAnother question posed by the researchers: What level of calorie restrictions would have an impact on biomarkers of aging?\n\nAging biomarkers are simple biological measurements that differentiate longer-lived people -- those who celebrate birthdays into their 90s and 100s -- from people who live the average life expectancy, Redman said.\n\n\"We know that longer-lived individuals are able to sustain lower blood sugar levels and lower levels of insulin and have lower core body temperature levels in comparison to people who don't live as long as them,\" she said.\n\nAfter the pilot studies, the National Institute on Aging committed to funding larger phase two CALERIE studies at three universities: Pennington in Baton Rouge, Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University in Boston.\n\nAt Pennington, Redman and her colleagues focused on reducing calories by 25% through diet alone. Women between 25 and 45 and men between 25 and 50 were recruited; about half were normal weight and the other half overweight but not obese. Throughout the study, participants ate what they liked, yet they also took vitamins and supplements to ensure that their diets were \"nutritionally adequate,\" Redman said.\n\nEach participant was also given a scale. Instead of calculating daily calories and slashing them by 25%, weight loss was used to estimate the total reduction in calories for each participant over time.\n\nHowever, the participants did not hit the 25% reduction as anticipated, Redman said: \"People achieved 15% calorie restriction, actual, over the two years.\" No matter. The results from this lesser calorie restriction amount were \"pretty remarkable,\" she said.\n\nFor example, participants lost an average of about 20 pounds each by the end of the first year and maintained that loss during the second year.\n\n\"The calorie-restrictive diet also caused a reduction in sleeping metabolic rate by about 10%,\" Redman said. This remained true after one year, when weight loss peaked, and after two years, when weight remained constant.\n\nA slowed metabolism means the body has become more efficient in using fuel -- whether from food or oxygen -- to derive energy.\n\n\"It's important because every time we generate energy in the body, we generate byproducts,\" Redman said. These byproducts of normal metabolism, also called oxygen radicals, accumulate in the body and over time cause damage to cells and organs, she explained. And this damage is \"what has been linked to a shortened lifespan,\" she said.\n\nNot only did calorie restriction slow the metabolism of participants, lower levels of oxidative damage were seen when measured by a compound in urine. Calorie restriction, then, mimicked some of the healthy aging signposts seen in long-lived individuals, Redman said.\n\n'Breakthrough'\n\nThe \"big breakthrough\" with this study, said biologist John R. Speakman of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, is that it is the first randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in humans.\n\nRandomized, controlled trials, in which participants are divided by chance into groups to compare interventions, are considered more valuable to scientists than other types of experiments. Speakman, who did not participate in the research but he served on the data safety and monitoring board for the CALERIE project, explained that all previous studies of calorie restriction in humans have been on a voluntary basis.\n\n\"It has been known since the 1930s that calorie restriction reduces the rate of aging and extends lifespan in rodents,\" Speakman said. Since then, studies in different animals show the same general pattern -- with some exceptions. \"For example, it doesn't work in houseflies,\" he said. \"Plus, the monkey literature is a bit confusing.\"\n\nFor this reason, the new study's \"big contribution\" is that participants showed two key changes previously observed in calorie-restricted rodents: lowered metabolic rate and reduced production of radical oxygen species, Speakman said.\n\nThat said, the level of calorie restriction achieved in the new study was \"rather modest compared to that used in rodents and other animals,\" he said. \"This really shows the difficulties in doing calorie restriction work on humans.\" However, a strength of the new research is that it \"included extensive measurements of the individual responses.\"\n\nExactly how calorie restriction prevents aging, Speakman said \"is the million-dollar question.\" The research supports two theories of longer life: the \"rate of living\" (lower metabolism) and reduced oxidative damage.\n\nHowever, the study shows a correlation only, he said, \"so we can't infer that these changes are causally linked to reduced aging. Nevertheless it is a step forwards to indicate that these two ideas are not rejected by the current research.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nGoing forward, Redman wants to reconvene the study participants to see whether they're maintaining calorie restrictions and lowered metabolic rates. She also wants to study a group of people from early in their lives until death so she can see the possible long-term results of restricted calorie intake.\n\nIt's not only the diet, she repeated.\n\nIt's true that the people who see more sunrises than most of us eat less -- and more healthy -- calories than in a Western diet, Redman said. \"But what's important is they're living longer and they're free of chronic disease.\"",

    "text": "Story highlights Look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods\n\nMore than 70% of sodium in an average American diet comes in packaged, prepared and restaurant foods\n\n(CNN) We've covered the many health reasons to curb your salt intake. But let's talk about how, especially when it's hidden in many of the foods we love.\n\nWhen cutting back on sodium, it's important to start slowly, as going cold turkey can shock your taste buds. \"If you try to make chicken soup with no salt, you will notice the difference,\" said Sonya Angelone, a registered dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular nutrition and is the media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead, start with half of the amount of salt you would typically use.\n\nYou can also look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods, or make your own versions, like homemade spaghetti sauce. For example, canned tomato sauce can have 1,000 milligrams of sodium per serving. \"But canned tomatoes have about 300 milligrams, and tomato paste has very little sodium -- so you can just add water or low-sodium chicken broth\" to make a sauce, Angelone said.\n\nUsing herbs and spices can help bring out flavor in foods without salt. Spice blends without salt can come in handy during cooking. You might use a Mexican blend with cumin, chili pepper and smoked paprika for chili, while blends containing rosemary, thyme and oregano might be well suited for Italian dishes, Angelone explained.\n\nWhen dining out, ask for steamed vegetables and fish, and skip the sauces. And when food shopping, compare the sodium values of similar foods. \"Some rolls can have 400 milligrams; other ones can have 200,\" Angelone said. Breads and rolls are top sources of sodium in the US diet, according to the American Heart Association , along with cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, soup, sandwiches and poultry.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.\n\nBut whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.\n\nIn fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.\n\nBut there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.\n\n\"Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old,\" said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of \"The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great.\" \"What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging.\"\n\nSugar addiction\n\nHere's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. \"People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar,\" Alpert said. \"We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How to tame a sweet tooth Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to tame a sweet tooth 01:05\n\nAbout 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.\n\n\"People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night,\" Alpert said.\n\nHow to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days\n\nThe good news is that even if you're not a true sugar \"addict,\" by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.\n\n\"There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets,\" Lustig said.\n\nChildren can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.\n\nBut going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.\n\n\"Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clich\u00e9d and not effective,\" Alpert said. \"It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.\n\n\"What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate,\" she said. \"They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to.\"\n\nSo for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. \"You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats.\"\n\nFor example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.\n\nThough they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. \"These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is,\" Alpert said.\n\nConsuming artificial sweeteners causes \"you not only (to) store more fat,\" Lustig explained, \"you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage.\"\n\nHow to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy\n\nOnce the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.\n\n\"By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy,\" Alpert said. \"The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again.\"\n\nStarting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. \"Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster,\" Alpert said.\n\nYou can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.\n\nDuring week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.\n\nFor week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.\n\n\"Week three should be quite livable,\" Alpert said.\n\nWeek four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.\n\n\"You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier,\" Alpert said. \"I want people living. Week four is the way to do it.\"\n\nWeek four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. \"Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one,\" Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.\n\n\"The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life,\" Alpert said.\n\n\n\nBenefits and cautions with slashing sugar\n\nDetoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. \"We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction,\" Alpert said. \"Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!\"\n\nParticipants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.\n\nPhotos: Natural sweeteners Photos: Natural sweeteners Although maple syrup contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the amounts in a typical serving are quite small. One tablespoon provides about 1% of your daily needs for calcium, potassium and iron. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Natural sweeteners Honey has been shown to possess small amounts of nutrients, antioxidants and antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory compounds.

Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: Natural sweeteners Blackstrap molasses contains 6% of your daily value for iron and calcium. Plus, it has been shown to have higher antioxidant levels than any other sweetener. Hide Caption 5 of 5\n\n\"I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox,\" said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.\n\n\"I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes.\"\n\nDiane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. \"This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal.\"\n\nThere are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.\n\n\"Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue,\" Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided.\n\n\"If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction,\" Alpert said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIt's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.\n\nFinally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. \"You need people around you to help you be successful,\" Lustig said. \"The whole family has to do it together.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Looking for an easy diet to lose a quick few pounds? If you're searching on the Internet, chances are you've stumbled on something called the \"military diet.\"\n\nIt's also known as the Navy diet, the Army diet and sometimes the ice cream diet, because in addition to hot dogs and tuna fish, you get to eat ice cream on all three days of the program.\n\nSmells fishy, right? Well, hold your nose. It's about to get really stinky.\n\nWhat is the military diet?\n\nThe military diet is a variation of the ever-popular three-day diet, a crash plan of \"fill-in-the-blank\" foods to eat if you want to lose weight fast. These diets typically claim that you can lose about 10 pounds in three days to a week if you follow their blueprint to the letter. The meal plans are usually extremely basic and calorie-restrictive, because let's face it, that's how you lose weight.\n\nBut are these diets healthy? Will the weight stay off?\n\n\"With this type of low-calorie, lower-carbohydrate diet, you are losing mostly water and potentially some muscle,\" said registered dietitian Elaine Magee , author of \"Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Diabetes.\" \"Water weight drops quickly as the body's glycogen stores decline, which happens when you restrict carbs and calories. Weight will come back when you begin to eat normally again.\"\n\nCould it be that the military diet is different? Here's a breakdown of what's prescribed on days one to three of the military diet, with calories calculated via the US Department of Agriculture's calorie-calculating tool, Supertracker.\n\nBreakfast is a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea, one slice of toast with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and half a grapefruit. That's 308 calories.\n\nLunch is another cup of coffee or tea, a bare-bones slice of toast (whole-wheat is best, they rightly say) and a half-cup of tuna. This meal is tiny, only 139 calories.\n\nDinner is 3 ounces of any meat (that's about the size of a playing card), a cup of green beans, half of a banana and a small apple (not a large apple, even though the calorie difference is minuscule), but wait: You get a whole cup of vanilla ice cream! If you choose steak instead of a lean chicken breast as your entree, this meal equals 619 calories.\n\nBut even with the steak and the cup of full-fat ice cream, the day adds up to a mere 1,066 calories. No snacks allowed.\n\n\"If you're used to eating 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day, such a drastic drop will be hard to do,\" said registered dietitian Lisa Drayer , who writes about nutrition for CNN. \"You're going to be tired and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. It will be hard to exercise, and I would think you'll be quite hungry as well.\"\n\nHere's day two's repast. It adds up to only 1,193 calories, even if you pick some higher-fat options.\n\nBreakfast is another dry piece of toast, one egg cooked however you like and half of a banana. Let's say you fry your egg in oil. That's 223 calories.\n\nLunch is a hard-boiled egg, five saltine crackers and a cup of cottage cheese. If you choose full-fat cottage cheese, the total is 340 calories.\n\nDinner is half of a banana, a half-cup of carrots, a full cup of broccoli, two hot dogs (that's right!) and another treat: a half-cup of vanilla ice cream. The meal totals 630 calories (if you eat a full-fat pork or beef dog).\n\nHow does this fare fair?\n\n\"I never recommend hot dogs or any processed meats,\" Drayer said, \"because they are associated with a higher risk for cancer .\"\n\n\"Ice cream is not a good use of the meager calories,\" she added. \"You could have 3 cups of salad and only eat 100 calories, or other nutritious foods that will be satisfying and hold back the hunger.\"\n\nDay three is the most restrictive, only 762 calories.\n\nBreakfast is a slice of cheddar cheese with five saltines and a small apple. That's 232 calories.\n\nLunch is grim: one dry slice of toast and an egg. Even if you fry the egg in oil again, that's a total of 170 calories.\n\nDinner is 460 calories and a stomach-turning combination of half a banana, a full cup of tuna and another cup of ice cream. Maybe they think that by now, you're so hungry, you'll be willing to eat those foods together.\n\nThe websites promoting the military diet say that eating certain food combinations will boost your metabolism.\n\n\"There is no truth behind claims that the food combinations in the first few days will increase your metabolism and burn fat,\" Magee said.\n\n\"There's no research I know of behind those claims,\" Drayer agreed.\n\nAnd what about the rest of the week?\n\nYou round out your week by eating what you like, so long as it's less than 1,500 calories a day. Then you can start on the three-day restrictions again.\n\nBest of all, no exercise -- zero, zip, nada -- is said to be needed on this diet.\n\n\"Yet another fad diet that won't lead to healthy or sustainable weight loss!\" Magee said with passion, adding that exercise is \"key to lasting weight loss.\"\n\nShe also feels there are potential physical and emotional ramifications to diets that restrict and deprive you to this extent.\n\n\"It can lead to weight cycling, a quick loss and regain of weight, that can weaken your immune system, mess with your metabolic rate and increase the risk of other health problems, such as gallstones and heart trouble,\" Magee said.\n\nWhy is it called the military diet?\n\narticles, bloggers, Why would such a fad diet be associated with the military? According to various YouTubers and message board posts , it was designed by nutritionists in the US military to drop pounds off recruits who otherwise wouldn't measure up.\n\n\"What? In my 30 years working with the military, I've never heard of it,\" said certified nutrition specialist Patricia Deuster , professor at the Uniformed Services University and author of the first US Navy SEAL Nutrition guide.\n\n\"We did not develop this. We do not use it. It has absolutely no resemblance to the real military diet. Even our rations are healthier and more nutritionally sound,\" Deuster said. \"It looks like they just took the name 'military' and added it to the diet and capitalized on it.\"\n\n\"The Birmingham Hospital Diet did not originate with the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and we do not support or recommend it,\" university public relations manager Bob Shepard said. \"This diet has absolutely no connection to UAB Hospital other than the often repeated but false Internet rumors.\"\n\nOh?\n\n\"It is unfortunate our name has been associated with this diet,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. \"We have never endorsed this meal plan, and it does not meet the standards for what we would consider a healthy diet for heart health or overall well-being.\"\n\nAnd?\n\n\"The American Heart Association is not -- and never has been -- associated with this diet.\"\n\n\"This didn't come from us, despite the use of the word Kaiser. Kaiser Permanente supports a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\"\n\n\"None of these diets, including the three-day diet, was developed at or ever associated with Mayo Clinic,\" said Dr. Donald Hensrud, director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program and medical editor of the real Mayo Clinic Diet. \"It is likely the originators tried to capitalize on Mayo Clinic's brand recognition as a way of promoting these diets.\"\n\nWhere did this diet come from?\n\nIf you search the Internet for the military diet, you'll probably end up on the top result: themilitarydiet.com . There, you'll find the detailed diet, with pictures and tips on how to make it work for you. There are substitutions, frequently asked questions, a blog, a calorie count, a link to like them on Facebook and a review that fights back against nutritionists who debunk the diet.\n\nOh, and there are lots of ads.\n\nBut nowhere on the page is there an author, an expert, a nutritional guru. No one takes ownership of this information or gives you any credentials to prove their expertise.\n\n\"That's a red flag,\" Drayer said. \"Any helpful diet plan should be created or supported by a credible person or resource or organization. If something is out there without any author or inventor, anyone can say anything and not know how the body works.\"\n\nTrying to track down the owners of three of the most popular military diet sites proved to be a dead end. Emails and calls to listed numbers got no responses.\n\nHow diet misinformation spreads\n\n\"Due to our democratic process, we have a wide-open information environment in the US,\" said Brian Southwell, editor of a new book on fake news called \" Misinformation and Mass Audiences .\" \"There's no careful censoring of false information.\"\n\nAdd to that the fact that science still doesn't have the \"perfect\" solution for weight loss and maintenance, he said, and you've got an area that is ripe for exploitation.\n\n\"These dieting sites have a catchy name, the promise of lineage to established institutions, and that is what tends to spread across the Internet, instead of a peer-reviewed study,\" said Southwell, who directs the Science in the Public Sphere program at the nonprofit research group RTI Internationa l. \"And just like direct mail, if you get 5% of people to click through, you can make a huge profit. It doesn't cost much to unleash stuff online.\"\n\nDrayer agreed. \"I think a lot of people just want to know the next dieting magic bullet, quick fix, and they just go for these fad things.\"\n\nBut why are so many of us fooled in the first place?\n\nThe failure of some people's \"BS detectors\" when they encounter fake information can be explained, Southwell said, by what science now knows about how the brain processes data. Instead of sorting the good from bad as the information arrives, the brain accepts it all, \"and then in another part of the brain, it's tagged as true or false.\"\n\n\"It leaves open this window of opportunity,\" he explained, \"so people believe just long enough and then get tired, distracted, and what happens? They get sucked in. They might be skeptical at first but fail to do the research and think, 'well, maybe this will work. This might be my solution.' \"\n\nThe fact that so many of us share our discoveries with friends and loved ones on social accounts fuels the misinformation fire. Southwell calls it \"social contagion.\"\n\n\"It's like the dynamics of infectious disease. You've spread the disease before you've even come down with it, \" he explained. \"You find it, you share, you read more and find out that it's not effective, or you try it out and you're disappointed. But the genie is out of the bottle already.\"\n\nAccording to Southwell, that's exactly what many of these sites are counting on.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it ultimately gets debunked, because it's going to take a while for it to reach the same numbers of people as the original rumor or fake diet,\" he explained. \"And the debunking is not as sexy as the original diet lure.\n\n\"In the meantime, you might see the spread of unhealthy dieting behavior, and for some people with certain diseases or conditions, that can cause real harm,\" Southwell said, such as heart disease or diabetes. \"But it can't be traced back. Who is culpable for that?\"\n\nHealthy ways to lose fast?\n\nLet's face it. We still want a quick way to lose 5 or 10 pounds fast, just in time for that special occasion. Is it possible to do so in a healthy way?\n\n\"I will prescribe a modified three-day diet just to jump-start weight loss,\" Drayer said. \"I typically recommend increasing your water intake and eliminating all starchy carbs like breads, pasta, cereal and rice, as well as sweets and treats for one week. Doing this not only cuts calories, but you also shed some extra water too, which can be motivating as the numbers on the scale go down.\"\n\nFor those who drink their calories, Drayer recommends slashing sugary beverages such as sodas, flavored lattes, fruit juices and smoothies, \"as the calories from these beverages can really add up.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMagee prefers to trick the body into losing weight, to avoid what she calls a starvation backlash.\n\n\"When you decrease your calories so severely as they do in the three-day military diet, your body tends to go into conservation mode and actually burns fewer calories,\" she said, \"because it thinks you are entering a potato famine or similar, and it wants to survive.\n\n\"I think it's better to trick your body into burning calories by decreasing the calories you eat a little, increasing exercise to burn more calories, to create a daily deficit of about 250 calories a day,\" she explains. \"It's slower but more sustained weight loss, and you are more likely to lose body fat rather than muscle tissue and water.\"\n\nRegardless of what method you try, said Drayer, remember that any diet should be cleared by your nutritionist or doctor before you begin.

    "text": "(CNN) \"Intermittent fasting,\" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food, has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.\n\nThe method is not appropriate for everyone, however, particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising, it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad.\n\n\"The jury is still out, especially on how healthy, sustainable and realistic this approach is,\" said Samantha Heller, a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. \"Eating very low calories, or none, on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food.\"\n\nIf you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try, there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also, be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.\n\nPick the level of fasting you can handle\n\nThe appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity, as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity.\n\nOne regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day, whereas an approach known as the \"5:2\" diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third, much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days, during which anything can be eaten in any amount.\n\nThough time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day, especially if you tend to skip breakfast, alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain.\n\n\"People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult,\" said Kristen Smith, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.\n\nFor the greatest success, Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle, your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example, alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food, such as a chef.\n\nFocus on protein and fiber-rich foods on semi-fasting days\n\nProtein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.\n\nIf you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day, you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies, grilled chicken over spaghetti squash, an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks, she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt, two cups of plain popcorn, a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.\n\nHigh-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days, as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally, meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option, especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days.\n\nDon't gorge on non-fasting days\n\nOur bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days, when we do eat, our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available, Heller explained. \"We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less, we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want,\" she said.\n\nThat kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. \"Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day,\" Smith said.\n\nIn other words, having pancakes with bacon for breakfast, a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.\n\nDon't go overboard with exercise on fasting days\n\nStrenuous exercise, such as cycling, running, high-impact aerobics and weight lifting, is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity, Heller explained.\n\nIf you want to do some form of physical activity on those days, Smith recommends sticking with walking, stretching or gentle yoga.\n\nDrink enough water\n\nIf you decide to avoid food for any length of time, adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. \"On a fasting day, someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals, which is a common time people hydrate,\" Smith said.\n\nFoods such as fruits, vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages, as they may contribute to dehydration, Smith said.\n\nKnow when to stop\n\nIf you experience lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches,difficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning, you should stop fasting.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"If any of these symptoms occur, it might be a good time to meet with a registered dietitian to discuss other dietary interventions that might be better suited for you,\" Smith said.",

    "text": "Not long ago, fat was the evil dietary villain. Before that it was salt. Now the sugar-free diet has exploded onto the health and wellness scene -- and seems to have topped many people's list of New Year's resolutions.\n\nSugar-free diets encourage people to avoid table sugar (sucrose), sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup, refined flours, condiments, soft drinks, sweets and some fruits such as bananas. Some also recommend eliminating or restricting dairy products.\n\nThe diet's advocates rightly note that excessive sugar consumption may lead to obesity and therefore increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.\n\nAnd it's true we are swallowing too much of the sweet stuff, with the average American consuming around 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.\n\nBut you don't need to quit sugar to lift your game on healthy eating. Quitting sugar is unlikely to improve your health any more than cutting down on ultra-processed foods, eating more vegetables, cooking food from scratch and limiting how much extra sugar you eat and drink.\n\nAt best, the sugar-free diet is confusing and imposes an arbitrary set of rules that aren't based on scientific evidence. At worst, such a restrictive diet can create food fear or an unhealthy relationship with food.\n\nDiet mentality\n\nThe sugar-free diet is restrictive, with lists of \"allowed\" foods (such as whole grains, blueberries and grapefruits) and \"not allowed\" foods (such as white bread, bananas and raisins). This inadvertently promotes a diet mentality and causes followers to worry about accidentally eating something that's not allowed.\n\nPeople who worry about food are more likely to diet. This may be because they are worried specifically about their weight, or about the impact certain nutrients have on their health.\n\nResearch shows dieting is not effective over the long term and can lead to greater weight gain over time. The brain interprets dieting and restriction as a famine , which causes the storage of fat for future shortages.\n\nDieting is stressful. In response to this, our body releases stress hormones such as cortisol , which may cause the body to store fat, particularly in the abdominal area.\n\nWorrying about food can lead to stress , anxiety and depression, and is one of the defining features of the condition known as orthorexia\n\nOrthorexia is the overwhelming preoccupation with eating healthily. People with orthorexia spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about food and eliminating foods that are deemed impure or unhealthy. Some experts suggest this behaviour is a precursor to, or a form of, an eating disorder.\n\nEstimates suggest anywhere between 7% and 58% of the population may have the condition. There are no clear diagnostic criteria, which makes it difficult to measure its prevalence.\n\nBut we know 15% of women will experience an eating disorder at some stage in their life. So we need to ensure nutrition advice, however well-intentioned, doesn't promote or encourage disordered eating.\n\nCutting out the good stuff\n\nSome sugar-free diets advise people to cut out or restrict healthy foods and food groups such as fruit and dairy, without evidence to support their exclusion. This perpetuates the food fear/dietary restriction cycle and may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.\n\nThese diets also recommend people avoid fruit for a period of time , and then re-introduce a limited list of expensive \"healthy\" fruits (such as berries) while avoiding the cheaper \"unhealthy\" fruits such as bananas.\n\nWhole fruit is a wonderful source of fibre, essential vitamins and minerals, as well as antioxidants. Two serves of fruit per day can reduce the risk of developing some cancers, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Given American adults only consume half their daily requirements for fruit, the advice to restrict fruit further could result in people missing out on these benefits.\n\nMany sugar-free followers also avoid plain dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese, due to the assumption these contain sugars.\n\nThe sugar in plain dairy products is the natural lactose (a carbohydrate), which is nothing to fear. Unnecessarily avoiding dairy may increase the risk of osteoporosis if not replaced with adequate levels of calcium from other sources.\n\nSugar replacements\n\nStrangely, many of the sugar-free recipes use expensive sugar alternatives -- such as rice malt syrup (due to its low fructose content), maple syrup (which is sometimes allowed and sometimes not) and dates -- to replace sugar.\n\nHowever, these are still sugars and contain the same number of calories per gram as any other sugar. These alternatives offer no additional nutritional benefits other than rice malt syrup, which is a useful option only for those with a fructose malabsorption issue, and dates, which contain fibre.\n\nPeople often eat more of the food containing these alternatives under the guise of it being sugar-free , which could lead to unintentional weight gain. One study found people ate about 35% more of a snack when it was perceived as healthy than when it was seen as unhealthy.\n\nWhat to do instead\n\nEat plenty of plants, enjoy whole grains, beans and legumes. Fruit is your friend -- not your enemy.\n\nMost people could probably eat a little less sugar, a little less often, but you don't have to quit it for good to be healthy.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSavour every mouthful of that chocolate cake or \"sometimes food\". Turn off technology and eat the cake mindfully, so that your brain can register that you have eaten it. That way you can get pleasure and satisfaction from it, and you won't be craving it again an hour later.\n\nNo matter how we choose to eat, remember that health is not simply about the number on the scale, the size of our waist, or the foods we avoid. It's also about our psychological health and our relationship with food, which is just as important as our physical health.",

    "text": "(CNN) Keeping your heart healthy is about more than avoiding fast food and overly processed chow. You can also pump up your heart's health by choosing foods that will help reduce cholesterol, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation.\n\nWhich food groups have the most science behind their heart-healthy claims?\n\nOats and barley\n\nThe cell walls of oats and barley contain a special type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which has a host of benefits for human health. Studies show that it blunts the body's insulin response and boosts immunity, and it may be protective during radiation and chemotherapy. But its role in cholesterol reduction is what counts for heart health.\n\n\"Beta-glucans bind to bile acids and cholesterol in the intestines and prevent their absorption into the body,\" CNN contributor and registered dietitian Lisa Drayer said. \"So, if you have high cholesterol, it would be a good idea to incorporate oats or oatmeal for breakfast on a regular basis.\"\n\nOther grains, such as rye, wheat and sorghum, contain beta-glucans but in much smaller quantities than oats and barley. Beta-glucans are also found in seaweed, baker's yeast and various species of mushrooms such as reishi, shiitake and maitake.\n\nResearch shows that eating 3 grams of beta-glucans a day will reduce cholesterol by up to 10%. According to Heart UK , a British charity dedicated to helping those with high cholesterol, you can accomplish by eating a bowl of oatmeal each day; adding 2 tablespoons of oat bran to your smoothie, soup or entree at lunch; and having an oatmeal cookie for a snack.\n\nHeart UK says you can replace one of those oat servings with 150 grams (\u2154 cup) of cooked pearl barley.\n\nSalmon and other fatty fish\n\nFish oils, especially omega-3 fatty acids, are critical for maintaining a healthy heart. That means fatty fish such as salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, herring, lake trout and sardines and crustaceans such as lobster, oysters and squid are the protein staples of a heart-healthy diet. They all contain health-protective omega-3s, specifically the long-chain variety known as LC omega-3, which contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).\n\nLong-chain omega-3s have been shown in human clinical trials to prevent heart attacks by helping the heart maintain its rhythm. Studies show that they also make blood less likely to clot, lower blood pressure, keep blood vessels healthy and less likely to narrow, reduce triglycerides and lower inflammation. Whew!\n\nThe shorter chain of omega-3, called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is found abundantly in oils, plants, nuts and seeds, but evidence of its benefit is not as strong.\n\n\"The plant-based omega-3s in foods like flaxseed, walnuts and canola oil don't contain DHA and EPA,\" Drayer said. \"And while there are benefits to the plant ones as well, you can't count on them as a source for their longer-chain cousins, because they are not necessarily converted into them once they are in the body.\"\n\nFatty fish like salmon have the most long-chain omega-3s, and the American Heart Association recommends adding a 3\u00bd-ounce serving to your diet at least twice a week. Children and pregnant women should be careful to consume fish with lower levels of mercury, the association says, such as fresh and water-packed canned salmon.\n\nHowever, Drayer says, be careful how you prepare your catch.\n\n\"You can make healthy foods unhealthy depending on how you cook them,\" Drayer said. \"For example, if you deep-fry fish, all the unhealthy saturated or trans fat can outweigh the heart-healthy benefits. Ideally, you want to broil, bake, grill or poach -- but in water, not in oil. Oil will contribute lots of extra calories. If a menu doesn't specify, ask how the fish is poached.\"\n\nWhat if fatty fish is just not your thing?\n\n\"If you never eat fish, you might consider a fish-oil supplement because of all the research on omega-3's benefits for heart and brain health,\" Drayer said.\n\n\"There are some foods fortified with EPA and DHA omega-3s,\" added registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \"Some of them are eggs, milk, juices, peanut butter and margarine spreads.\"\n\n\"So instead of having regular spread on your toast, you can add something to your diet that has an added heart benefit,\" Drayer said. \"Why not give yourself an added edge?\"\n\nBe aware that most fortified foods have a fraction of the omega-3s of fatty fish and may be the shorter-chain variety.\n\nDark leafy greens\n\nSalad greens, spinach, kale, swiss chard, collard and mustard greens are rich in vitamins A, C, E and K and contain antioxidants that help rid toxins from the body. But it's their abundance of calcium, magnesium and potassium that puts them on the top 10 list for heart health.\n\n\"Potassium, magnesium and calcium are known to play a role in blood pressure regulation,\" said Al Bochi, who specializes in helping patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for heart disease.\n\n\"Potassium is known to help with limiting the effects of sodium on blood pressure,\" she explained, \"And it, along with magnesium and calcium, help the walls of the blood vessels relax, which increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure.\"\n\nGreens have minimal calories: One cup of spinach or Swiss chard is only 7 calories, and kale has 33. Nutritionists say it's usually best to get your calcium, magnesium and potassium from foods instead of supplements, so pile that plate high.\n\nPlus, greens -- like most vegetables -- are full of fiber, which helps lower cholesterol levels, prevents constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) and, by helping you feel full, helps with weight control. And of course, maintaining a healthy weight is a key to good heart health.\n\nNuts and seeds\n\nUnsalted seeds and nuts are also high in potassium, magnesium and other minerals known to reduce blood pressure.\n\nStudies on pistachios , for example, find that the nut can reduce blood vessel tightening (called peripheral vascular resistance), heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol. According to one study , a single helping a day was better at lowering blood pressure than two helpings.\n\nWalnuts, pecans, almonds, flaxseed, macadamia nuts and hazelnuts are also good choices. Walnuts are especially high in omega-3s but are the short-chain variety. Still, that's good for the heart.\n\n\"Though to a lesser extent than long-chain omega-3s,\" Drayer said, \"alpha linolenic acid (ALA) -- a short-chain omega-3 found in walnuts and flaxseed and canola oil -- has been associated with protection against high blood pressure and heart disease.\"\n\nBut keep in mind that all nuts are extremely high in calories. So an American Heart Association recommended serving is going to seem tiny: about 1\u00bd ounces or 2 tablespoons of nut butter. Beware of the added salt, sugar or chocolate that is so appealing on nuts -- not good for heart health.\n\nBeets\n\nA surprising choice? Beets turn out to be chock full of nitric oxide, which studies show can help open blood vessels and therefore lower your blood pressure. In fact, a small study of Australian men and women found that drinking 500 grams (about 2\u00bd cups) of beet juice significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) within six hours.\n\nThat's not all. Beets and their juice are one of the only sources of betalain, a powerful antioxidant with high anti-inflammatory qualities, which has sparked research into how beets could be used to treat diseases caused by chronic inflammation, such as arthritis cancer and heart failure.\n\nAvocados\n\nAlready eating a healthy diet? Be sure to add avocadoes once a day. A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that replacing saturated fat with one nutrient-packed avocado a day could lead to up to a 13.5 milligrams-per-deciliter reduction in blood pressure. That could be enough to keep some people off blood pressure meds, researchers say.\n\nAvocados are a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which can lower both your total cholesterol and your \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL) while maintaining your \"good\" cholesterol (HDL) levels. They can also benefit insulin contro l, which can be very helpful to those with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.\n\nOlive oil\n\nA key component of the Mediterranean diet is the use of olive oil for cooking and for dressing salads and vegetables in place of more saturated fats, such as butter.\n\nOlive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and both bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol.\n\nHDL is often called the \"friendly scavenger\" because it scours the blood for bad cholesterol and gets rid of it before it clogs arteries. That's why having high levels of HDL is considered good for the heart.\n\nrecent study of 300 Spanish men and women at high risk for cardiovascular events sheds some light on how the higher HDL from olive oil might work. Researchers compared people who ate a Mediterranean diet based on nuts and a group based on olive oil. The group who ate more olive oil had better-functioning HDL; in other words, their HDL was more efficient at finding and removing LDL and sending it to the liver as waste.\n\nRegardless of how it works, olive oil is extremely high in calories. It should be used in moderation and as a replacement for more unhealthy fats in the diet.\n\nLegumes\n\nNo heart-healthy list would be complete without legumes, which include all kinds of beans, lentils, chickpeas and black-eyed peas.\n\nLegumes help the heart because of their high levels of soluble fiber, which is known to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the bloodstream.\n\n\"Soluble fiber binds to extra LDL cholesterol in the body and disposes it in the form of waste,\" Al Bochi said. \"You can think of it as a type of sponge.\"\n\nStudies have shown that eating less than a cup of legumes improved blood pressure , and a randomized controlled trial found that obese subjects who ate two servings a day of legumes and four servings of whole grains reduced their waist circumference, weight, triglycerides and blood pressure.\n\nLegumes contain no cholesterol and are only about 3% fat (unless they are prepared with lard or other unhealthy fats). They are full of iron, manganese, copper, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc and phosphorous, and they are very low on the glycemic index, which means they have less effect on your blood sugar. They are also extremely high in protein; for example, a half-cup of some legumes has 8 grams of protein.\n\nOne caveat: Most people eat canned version of beans and other legumes, which will be packed with salt as a preservative. Salt, of course, can raise blood pressure.\n\n\"Make sure that you rinse the excess salt and water before consuming,\" Al Bochi said. \"And it's not just beans and lentils. Whether it's canned corn, canned peas, carrots, any type of canned food, it's important to remove the salt.\"\n\nLow-fat dairy\n\nIt may seem odd to include dairy in a list of top heart-healthy foods, but it turns out that milk, cheese and yogurt can help reduce blood pressure.\n\nIn a study by Boston University, researchers followed the eating habits of 75,000 people for up to 30 years and found that women who ate yogurt at least five times a week had a 20% reduction in their risk of developing high blood pressure. Milk and cheese also had an impact on lowering blood pressure, but it was nothing like yogurt, said the researchers.\n\nMen in the study consumed much less yogurt than the women; the effect on their blood pressure was weaker.\n\n\"Dairy products contain calcium, potassium and magnesium, which are important minerals to help with blood pressure control,\" Al Bochi said.\n\nThose in the study who benefited most also closely followed the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's DASH diet , which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat, and limit your intake of salt.\n\nThe DASH meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes.\n\n\"You're getting the combination of benefits by consuming these foods because they do offer more than one heart-healthy nutrient,\" Drayer said.\n\nIn the Boston study, men and women who had a higher DASH score and who ate yogurt five or more times each week were 31% less likely to develop hypertension than participants who had low DASH scores and ate little yogurt.\n\nThough the study didn't track the type of yogurt eaten, experts stress choosing low-fat versions.\n\n\"Dairy products can contain a high amount of saturated fat, so be sure to choose low-fat products,\" Al Bochi said. \"Saturated fat has been known to increase LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol that can cause heart disease.\"\n\nA low-sodium, balanced diet\n\nNo. 10 on the heart healthy list may seem odd, but it's important. Experts say that rather than focusing on just one or two of the heart healthy foods, you would be better served to eat a well-rounded diet that focuses on healthy foods of all types and colors.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"If you feel like there is a 'superfood' that you want to incorporate on a daily basis, say oats or salmon, that's OK,\" Drayer said, \"but I really feel that eating a variety of healthy foods is best, because you're getting a different nutrient package with each.\n\n\"The other thing I worry about is when people focus on one food, they may think that is their key to good health and eat more unhealthy foods,\" Drayer added. \"For example, some people say, 'I eat a lot of kale, so I'm healthy,' and they don't pay attention to the rest of their diet. No one food can undo damage from an unhealthy diet.\"\n\nUnless your doctor says otherwise, part of a heart-healthy diet is watching your salt intake. The hidden salt in many of our processed foods make it extremely difficult: It's estimated that Americans get up to 80% of the salt in their diet from processed foods. The American Heart Association has a list of some of the top offenders, called the \"Salty Six\": breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, sandwiches, pizza, soup and chicken.\n\n\"Some ways to help reduce the amount of sodium in your diet is to limit the amount of processed foods, the amount of frozen dinners, for example, as well as adding salt to foods yourself,\" Al Bochi said. \"Consider using some herbs and spices as well as fresh lemon and vinegar to add some flavor to your meals.\"\n\nFinally, a heart-healthy diet should just be part of an overall heart-healthy plan that includes exercise, weight loss, stress reduction and not smoking.",

Whether you want to drop 10 pounds, improve your cholesterol or have more energy, we have five food-related New Year's resolutions that will help you achieve your goals.\n\nBeing adequately hydrated can help to ward off fatigue, keep hunger at bay and boost metabolism. \"It keeps your body running efficiently, allowing it to work smarter, not harder,\" said Caroline Passerrello, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nConsider the calorie savings, too: If you replace every 150-calorie can of soda consumed daily with a glass of water, you save more than 1,000 calories per week, which translates to 15 pounds lost over a year. Drinking a glass of water before a meal can help fill you up and eat fewer food calories.\n\nIn the same way you plan meals, you can plan your water intake. This is especially important for older individuals, for whom thirst can be a poor indicator of one's fluid needs. Additionally, since thirst can be mistaken for hunger, planning to drink throughout the day can help you avoid unnecessary snacking.\n\nCarrying a refillable water bottle can serve as a constant reminder to drink more. \"I used a water bottle that had a hook on it and hooked my keys on it ... so everywhere I go, I now have a water bottle. It becomes part of your routine,\" Passerrello said.\n\nIf plain water is unappealing, try adding fruit or vegetable slices such as oranges, lemons, strawberries or cucumber to boost flavor. Carbonated water is another option. \"There are countless options of flavored sparkling water and seltzer on the store shelves these days. Select ones that are naturally sweetened and have zero calories,\" Passerrello said.\n\nHow to measure it:\n\nHave a daily water goal.

    "text": "(CNN) There's no magic pill that will cure you of your cravings. But there is something that may help the effort, and it's all-natural.\n\nResearch has shown that simply spicing up your diet may help you consume less salt and possibly less sugar, while potentially improving your health even beyond the reduction of salt and sugar.\n\nThere is more consistent evidence that spicy food helps curb salt cravings than sugar.\n\nIn a study involving more than 600 people from China whose brains were analyzed with PET/CT scans, researchers found that regions stimulated by intake of both salty and spicy foods overlapped. Because of similar activities taking place in this shared space (think of the overlapping parts of a Venn diagram), consuming spicy foods effectively enhanced one's sensitivity to salt, thereby helping people crave and consume less salt.\n\n\"We think that spicy food can trick our brain when tasting salty food. It makes us taste the same (level of) saltiness even when a reduced amount of salt is actually consumed,\" said study author Dr. Zhiming Zhu, professor and director of the Department of Hypertension and Endocrinology at the Third Military Medical University in Chongqing, China.\n\nIn fact, researchers found that people who regularly enjoy spicy foods consumed 2.5 grams less salt in a day (that's 1,000 fewer milligrams of sodium) compared with those who typically steer clear of spice. They also had lower blood pressure.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the findings can be replicated in other populations outside China, said Richard David Wainford, associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology at the Boston University School of Medicine, in an accompanying editorial. Still, \"a lifestyle intervention that adds taste to the diet, in the form of extra spice and flavor, versus reduction of the pleasure given by the salt we add to our food, may have more success as a public health strategy to promote population-level dietary salt reduction,\" he added.\n\nSpice may have the potential to curb sugar cravings too, though the evidence is mixed. In one study involving 40 students from Denmark, when chili pepper was added to sweet, sour and bitter meals, participants experienced a greater desire to eat sweet foods compared with meals without chili added.\n\nIn another study, also from Denmark, people experienced a decreased desire for salty and spicy foods when they ate tomato soup with cayenne pepper compared with eating the soup without pepper. But their desire for sweet and fatty foods significantly increased when they consumed the spicy soup.\n\nNo pain, no weight gain?\n\nCapsaicin is the compound in chili peppers that is responsible for the burning sensation we experience when eating them. The compound has the ability to suppress sweet taste, which could also explain some findings.\n\nBut while some may enjoy the heat that capsaicin produces, it may also come with an unintended consequence.\n\n\"Capsaicin helps fight pain. Most of the time, you hear about this as a topical cream, but eating chili peppers also has benefits. It may be that when the pain goes away, you're stimulated to consume more sweet foods,\" said Mary-Jon Ludy, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at Bowling Green State University.\n\nIn a meta-analysis, involving more than 70 studies , funded by the National Institutes of Health and the McCormick Science Institute, researchers state that the balance of the literature suggests the capsaicin suppresses appetite, though the magnitude of the effects is small. \"Purposeful inclusion of these compounds in the diet may aid weight management, albeit modestly,\" the study stated.\n\n(Note that the National Institutes of Health is a federal government agency, and the McCormick Science Institute is an independent research organization that is owned and funded by spice product manufacturer McCormick & Co. Inc. The company said it does not influence the science institute's research priorities.)\n\nThe meta-analysis included the Danish study that found increased sugar cravings among those who consumed spicy meals. But it also included a study that found adding spice can actually curb sugar cravings . In that study, when people added half a teaspoon of red pepper to their lunch, they had a decreased desire to eat sugary, fatty and salty foods, and ate about 70 fewer calories at their next meal. The effects were seen only among those who didn't regularly consume red pepper.\n\n\"I think that there's something in the novelty of the stimulus that would allow you to eat less,\" said Ludy, who authored the study and the meta-analysis. \"In terms of the work with red pepper, I think that that's an important piece of the puzzle. If you are adding a spicy meal every couple of weeks, it might be enough to have an effect ... but if you have it every day, the effect goes away, because you get used to it.\"\n\nA little dash will do ya\n\nTo get started with spice, Ludy recommends sprinkling red pepper flakes into eggs in the morning. You can also use spice when making a rub for meat or when seasoning vegetables, soups, pasta or curry dishes.\n\nShe also recommends adding red pepper flakes to a meal in anticipation of a tempting dessert. \"It may give you that extra piece of security,\" she said. Though not specific to sweet taste, cinnamon, ginger and saffron are other pungent spices with appetite suppressive effects, according to Ludy.\n\nHowever you choose to use spice, it's wise to start slowly. \"Remember that a tiny bit of spice can go a long way!\" Ludy said. If the heat is an issue, you can calm your taste buds by pairing hot spices with healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, according to Ludy. \"They help break down the chemical that causes the burn.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you're new to spicy peppers, she recommends starting with milder varieties, such as jalapeno or serrano, which cause less burn than cayenne or habanero. \"These peppers still contain some capsaicin but not as much. Although I haven't researched it directly, my guess is that there would still be appetite effects (perhaps of a lesser magnitude) ... but if you can't tolerate higher quantities of spice, something is better than nothing, right?\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Yes, cheese is nutrient-rich -- and tasty -- but it's best to consume it in small portions.\n\n\"Cheese does contain some important nutrients, including calcium and protein, along with vitamin B12 and zinc. However, the calories can add up quickly if you aren't mindful,\" said Kelly Pritchett, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nSofter cheeses tend to have fewer calories than hard cheeses: an ounce of whole-milk ricotta (approximately 2 tablespoons) has about 50 calories, an ounce of feta has 75 calories, and an ounce of whole-milk mozzarella has 85 calories. But an ounce of Swiss (one slice) has 108 calories, and an ounce of cheddar has 114 calories (picture about a one-inch cube, depending on the kind).\n\nFor the same calories, you can have a cup of black bean soup and probably feel just as full.\n\nCheese is also high in saturated fat, which is known to increase LDL cholesterol, the \"bad\" cholesterol. In fact, cheese is one of the biggest sources of saturated fat in the US diet\n\nSome research (supported by the Danish dairy board) suggests that full-fat cheeses don't seem to negatively affect LDL cholesterol as would be predicted based on its saturated fat content.\n\n\"It is not clear exactly why this is the case but may have to do with other nutrients in cheese, like calcium or protein, modifying the way the fat is absorbed or metabolized,\" said Gregory D. Miller, chief science officer for the National Dairy Council.\n\nStill, when it comes to fat content, some cheeses are lighter than others -- and the higher the fat, the higher the calories. Cottage cheese has the least amount of fat, with 1 gram per ounce. Ricotta has 4 grams of fat per ounce, and feta and mozzarella have 6 grams each. Parmesan, Swiss and cheddar are higher in fat, with 7, 8 and 9 grams of fat per ounce, respectively.\n\n\"Using soft cheeses like mozzarella versus cheddar can be helpful if you are looking for ways to cut calories,\" Pritchett said.\n\nInterestingly, despite its higher calorie content, hard cheese like cheddar can be beneficial for your teeth. Aside from getting calcium and other minerals from it, consuming hard cheese generates saliva , which helps make your mouth less acidic and your teeth less prone to cavities.\n\nPritchett suggests using cheese as a flavor enhancer for meals instead of making it the focus: sprinkle feta or goat cheese on a salad for extra flavor, or add Parmesan to your favorite soup for extra pep. And if you are enjoying cheese with crackers, limit it to 1 ounce.\n\n\"This would be the equivalent of a couple of dominos for softer cheeses like Brie, goat cheese or Havarti and about 4 small dice for hard cheese like Swiss or cheddar.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nLimiting portions will also keep sodium levels in check, as it can be as high as 260 milligrams for an ounce of feta and 390 milligrams for an ounce of hard Parmesan.\n\nSo feel free to enjoy cheese, but just be careful not to overdo it.",

    "text": "(CNN) Yes, dark chocolate has compounds that offer health benefits and can be enjoyed without guilt, even on a daily basis. But the portion size matters, since too many bites can contribute extra fat, sugar and calories and negate its health benefits.\n\nDark chocolate is rich in cocoa solids, which contain compounds known as flavanols. At high levels, cocoa flavanols have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol, improve cognition and possibly lower the risk of diabetes. Dark chocolate has the highest amount of cocoa flavanols; milk chocolate has less, and white chocolate has none.\n\nBut while cocoa flavanols in dark chocolate make it a healthful treat, they give it a bitter flavor. Manufacturers may process chocolate to make it more palatable, but doing so can remove some of these beneficial compounds\n\nFactors in processing, including fermentation and roasting, which deepen the flavor and give chocolate its distinct aroma, can affect flavanol content, explained Matt Hartings, assistant professor of chemistry at American University.\n\n\"Roasting generates all sorts of new flavors ... and to generate those flavors, you have to destroy molecules in the unroasted bean ... and there is always the chance that it is destroying compounds that we want around, including flavanols,\" Hartings said.\n\nThough the flavanol content may vary among dark chocolate brands, it's still a healthier choice than milk chocolate, which also tends to have more sugar.\n\nIf you need more justification to enjoy dark chocolate, consider this: A third of the fat in cocoa butter is stearic acid, a saturated fat that, unlike other saturated fats, appears to have a neutral effect on blood cholesterol . Additionally, cocoa powder contributes minerals, including calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.\n\nSo feel free to enjoy a piece of dark chocolate after a meal. Just keep a few facts in mind before you indulge.\n\nFirst, buy chocolate that is at least 60% cacao (i.e. cocoa). Generally speaking, the higher the percentage, the more flavanols, though the exact amount varies from batch to batch and depends on the extent of processing, according to Hartings.\n\n\"These higher-percentage chocolates have the added benefit over the lower percentages and milk and white chocolates because they contain less sugar and less fat,\" he said.\n\nSecond, if possible, choose natural cocoa over Dutch processed cocoa, which is treated with an alkali, a compound that neutralizes acid. This gives chocolate a milder flavor but removes healthful flavanols.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you are cooking, the ultimate choice of cocoa will depend on the recipe, according to Hartings. \"Some things are just better if you bake with Dutch processed cocoa,\" he said. \"If one ingredient in a recipe is highly acidic, then with natural cocoa, it may be too acidic.\"\n\nAnd finally, to keep weight in check, limit portions to 1 ounce of dark chocolate daily, or about 150 calories.",

    "text": "(CNN) If you're like many people I know, the thought of giving up pasta and bread in an effort to shed a few pounds (or more) might seem like an unfair punishment -- perhaps even a tease, especially when those foods seem to be on everyone else's plates.\n\nThe truth is, despite the popularity of low-carb diets, which often send the message that we should drastically cut back on this food group, carbohydrates are some of the most important things we consume. They are key to regulating blood sugar and providing energy throughout our bodies. Without them, our bodies will rely on protein, breaking it down for energy instead of using it in its preferred role of growing and maintaining tissues.\n\nWhat's more, eating the \"right\" kinds of carbs can keep us healthier.\n\n\"The people who live the longest, healthiest lives -- who have the lowest rates of diabetes, heart disease and cancer -- their diets are all rich in healthy carbs, including beans, legumes, whole grains and fruit,\" said Tamara Duker Freuman, a New York City-based registered dietitian.\n\nAnd so there's nothing wrong with a pasta meal (though whole grain is preferred) or even a sandwich on whole-wheat bread for lunch every day. Simply, the problem is not that we consume carbs; it's that we often consume the wrong kinds of carbs -- and very large portions of them.\n\nProcessed carbs are problem carbs\n\nHighly processed carbs -- white bread, sugary cereal, white rice, regular pasta and bagels, for example -- produce rapid rises and drops in blood sugar, which can lead to weight gain. They also can lead to something called metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\nMetabolic syndrome is \"the combination of high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and obesity,\" explained Dr. David Ludwig, professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"And processed carbs are the main dietary drivers.\" Studies show that \"processed carbs top the list for weight gain and diabetes risk,\" he said.\n\nThe tricky part is that the more processed, refined carbs we eat, the more we crave. And so it seems almost impossible to get off the carb-craving hamster wheel.\n\nAccording to Ludwig, who wrote the book \"Always Hungry? Conquer Cravings, Retrain Your Fat Cells, and Lose Weight Permanently,\" cravings have to do with our consumption of these highly processed, \"fast-acting\" carbs, which he says are not fundamentally different from sugar, in the biological sense. White bread or any other processed carbohydrate will melt into glucose very quickly -- and so like sugar, it raises blood sugar at a faster rate than slower-digesting carbs that are less processed and higher in fiber. The problem is, that rapid spike in blood sugar is eventually followed by a crash.\n\nInsulin: Miracle-Gro for fat cells\n\nAccording to Ludwig, what drives most carb cravings is not the taste of the foods per se but rather a biological urge to eat something to restore your blood sugar. And it has to do with the hormone insulin. \"Processed carbs cause more insulin secretion, calorie for calorie, than any food,\" he said.\n\nWhen you eat processed carbs, blood sugar rises rapidly, and insulin quickly follows, directing incoming calories into liver, muscle and fat cells. But of these, only fat cells have virtually limitless ability to store calories, and too many get trapped there, according to Ludwig. A short while later, the calories in the bloodstream are low, and the body runs out of available fuel, making you hungry too soon after the meal.\n\nIn essence, when fat cells get too much energy, there's not enough to fuel the brain, which is constantly monitoring the calories in your blood. \"When (the brain) sees calories are dropping, it triggers hunger and cravings,\" Ludwig said.\n\nAnd it all relates back to that initial insulin response. \"Insulin is the Miracle-Gro for fat cells,\" he said. \"When fat cells grow, we get hungry.\" And so the cycle repeats, eventually causing weight gain.\n\nHow to break carb cravings\n\nNutrition experts say that breaking carb cravings is not about getting rid of carbs entirely but rather cutting back on highly processed fast-acting carbs and eating more high-quality ones that are high in fiber and low in added sugars, such as beans, whole grains, fruit and vegetables. If you don't know how to get started, this plan can help:\n\n1. Cut out all starchy carbs for one week. This includes all pasta, bread, rice, bagels and potatoes, as well as pizza, crackers, pretzels, chips, cookies and cake.\n\nBy cutting starchy carbs and replacing them with foods that have a more modest impact on blood sugar, you can achieve more steady blood sugar control and better manage your cravings, according to Freuman.\n\nA day might include egg whites and cheese with berries for breakfast, yogurt for a snack, a grilled chicken salad with beans for lunch, an apple for a snack and a piece of fish and veggies for dinner.\n\n2. Slash the sugary carbs too, including candy and sugar-sweetened beverages. These sugary carbs rapidly flood the bloodstream, providing lots of sugar without any added nutrition.\n\n3. Add some fat. \"Many high-fat foods are luscious and do not cause an insulin release, so they keep your blood sugar much more stable,\" Ludwig said. Examples include nuts, nut butters, avocado, olive oil, dark chocolate and full-fat dairy. \"When you are eating them, you don't miss the processed carbs at all!\"\n\n4. After the first week, you can gradually add back high-quality starchy carbs, starting with breakfast.\n\n\"Research in a variety of populations has shown that eating carbs at breakfast seems to dampen the blood sugar effect of eating carbs at lunch,\" Freuman said. What this means is that on a day that you skip breakfast, you may be more likely to have a blood sugar spike after eating a carb-rich lunch, compared with a day when you eat breakfast but have the same lunch. In other words, \"don't skip breakfast, and don't skip carbs at breakfast,\" Freuman said.\n\nHigh-quality carbs -- including minimally processed grains, along with non-starchy vegetables, whole fruits and beans -- are the ones to choose. They are delicious and slower-digesting, thanks to the way they are naturally packaged, Ludwig said. \"If you eat wheat berries, your body has to digest the intact grain kernel, and that's a slow process. But if you mill it and turn it into flour, now that whole package has been broken. Too much of these 'naked carbs' (stripped of their bran and germ, which contain nutrients) will cause metabolic problems for most people.\"\n\nBreakfast examples with high-quality carbs include steel-cut oats with nuts, seeds and cinnamon; rye crisp bread with scrambled eggs and berries; or Greek yogurt topped with fruit. Freuman recommends beans at breakfast too, \"as in a Mexican breakfast with eggs, beans, avocado and salsa.\"\n\n5. After the second week, you can add back high-quality starchy carbs (i.e. minimally processed grains) to lunch. Good lunch examples include a chickpea or quinoa salad, bean or lentil soups, mushroom barley soup or a sandwich with whole-grain bread. Whole-wheat pasta or chickpea pasta is a good choice too, according to Freuman, though it should take up only about a quarter of the plate, to allow room for veggies and protein.\n\nFor the longer term\n\n6. Continue to skip starchy carbs at dinner. \"At dinner, when we eat carbs, we are much more likely to have a blood sugar spike and to store that food energy as fat versus having it available for useable energy,\" Freuman said.\n\n\"The metabolic response to a carbier meal at night is less favorable than when we eat carbs earlier in the day, so if there is ever one meal that you want eat low-carb, it's dinner ... and if you want to include them, choose wisely and keep the portions low,\" she added.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n7. Continue to limit refined carbs, such as white bread and white rice. It might be difficult to forgo white basmati rice, pizza or sushi entirely, but limit these foods to a few times per week.\n\n8. Continue to avoid foods high in added sugars. If you have a sweet tooth, limit treats to 100 to 150 calories per day, depending on your goals.\n\nAnd note that anyone with a medical issue should always consult their doctor before starting a new diet plan.",

    "text": "(CNN) Consider the glorious but humble donkey. According to the Bible, Jesus rode one, not a horse, into Jerusalem.\n\nThe significance was that it was a common man's animal for the common man's king, rather than a more traditionally royal steed. And its Sunday school lore that his mother rode one from Nazareth while pregnant, though that's not in the official canon. I checked.\n\nDomesticated for about 5,000 years, donkeys have been put to work for humanity's historically changing needs. They've been the family car, our U-Haul vans, engines pulling barges in canals and wagons out West, and they've been our workmates -- if you work in a mine or on a farm. They're still used in military operations to carry ground air missiles over difficult terrain.\n\nBurros, as the Spanish call them, walk at about a human's foot speed. They rarely kick or bite. They seem to have a calming effect on horses and humans. And they don't get nearly the respect they deserve, the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal kingdom.\n\nLike a cross between a Tesla and a wheelbarrow, donkeys are beasts of burden that can carry up to 300 pounds for more than two weeks in the mountains, while needing very little food or water. They're sort of the camels of the West. In fact, they're the camels of the East, North and South, too, as donkeys continue to thrive in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nAs some industries faded, the donkey soon added racing partner to its resume. When the US mining industry started to dry up in the 1930s and '40s, some enterprising Coloradans came up with the idea of attracting spectators to their towns by hosting an ultramarathon of human-donkey pairs -- The World Championship Pack Burro Race.\n\n\"They teach us so much,\" said pack burro race director Brad Wann. \"They teach us humility. They connect us with nature. Burros have the ability to reach into your soul.\"\n\nThe first race was in 1949, which makes it, according Wann, the second-oldest continuously run marathon in the country after the Boston Marathon.\n\nThe race also lends itself to a variety of puns. For example, the winner of the annual pack burro championship is the first to get his or her ass over the finish line. Wann's title is media relations officer for the Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation . There are eight of these eye-rollers in this article if you'd like to spot them all.\n\nBut it's still a serious sport, even if it has a sense of humor. \" Haulin' Ass \" is the title of a very straight documentary about the sport.\n\nA burro-ful day\n\nOriginally the race extended between Leadville and Fairplay, located in the middle of the state and only about 11 miles apart as the crow flies, but separated by a mountain. Legend holds that it was inspired by two miners who struck gold simultaneously and raced back to town to claim the find. The real story is that the race was inspired by a desire to keep former mining towns from turning into ghosts.\n\nNow both towns have their own races, part of an annual series of eight in Colorado. Fairplay, is the longest (29 miles), tied for highest (more than 13,000 feet), and the one that retained the World Championship title. The town is also home to the Prunes Monument, possibly the only monument in the world erected to honor a donkey. Prunes worked alongside a miner for more than 60 years.\n\nPhotos: Pack Burro World Championship At the annual World Championship Pack Burro Race in Colorado, it's not just about running an ultramarathon, it's about getting your ass across the finish line, too.

They connect us with nature.\" Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nRace day, in July, was a cool one of blue skies. This year 89 -- a record number -- of human-burro pairs competed in the 70th world championship, assembling in the Old West-looking Fairplay. Wann estimates at least 150,000 people showed up to watch the start of the race.\n\nThe smell of excitement and excrement was in the air as the starter gun signaled a mass start of two lengths. The 29-mile race had 20 pairs and 3,300 feet of elevation gain and a short course of 15 miles had another 69 pairs.\n\nThe start of the race is critical, explained Wann. \"Don't break their will, let the burro set the pace early on instead of shutting it down,\" he explained. \"Burros will pair up and want to go that pace, and you have to feel that out. So run as fast you can -- sprint if the donkey does. If you can't do that you'll have a slow donkey the rest of the race. It's a burro race, not a human race.\"\n\nThe course also ends in Fairplay, running through South Park (the show of the same name has somehow not done a burro racing episode), and then heading up dirt roads, trails and rocky terrain to the 13,185-foot summit of Mosquito Pass. (Or should that be Mosquito P-ass?)\n\nThe age range of the human runners at this year's world championship was 15 to 70, and they came from all over the US, Europe, Canada and even Africa. The California team brought in their own donkeys. About 65% were repeat runners addicted to the niche sport which consistently only takes place in Colorado, the state where it was born.\n\nAbout a third of the runners were women this year. In fact, the first woman to ever compete was Edna Miller, with her burro Pill, in 1951, nearly 20 years before the first woman ran the Boston Marathon (against the rules, even then).\n\nThe donks -- as insiders may refer to them -- that competed this year have adorable and delicious names such as Buckwheat, Hershey and Sweet Pea. Past winners have included BonBon and Cream Puff. My favorite name for a competitor this year was ReDONKulous. This year included 16 mini-donkeys on the short course.\n\nAnd don't call donkeys mules, which are actually half donkey and half horse breeds. Those half-assed animals aren't allowed to race in the pack burro circuit.\n\nRules state that the donks (I'm an insider now) must carry mining equipment: a pick, gold pan, shovel and saddle. This weighs about 16 pounds and for the mini-donkeys that's all they need; standard-sized donkeys must add weights to a minimum of 33 pounds. The rope attaching the team can't be longer than 15 feet and the runners don't dress as miners, though the occasional cowboy hat may allude to an earlier era.\n\nLike any ultramarathon, especially with elevation, endurance requires training. And in this case some animal husbandry skills as well. As a result, there are, of course, comical moments for bystanders watching when the donkey protests. Sometimes a burro will just shut down. In previous races, teams have had to drop out when this happens.\n\nThe air may be thin on oxygen up on Mosquito Pass, but the mountain views are amazing. Green and grey peaks are in all directions, the views as wild and West as some of pack animals.\n\nThis year's winning team was Kirt Courkamp and his burro Mary Margaret, finishing the 29 miles in just over 6 hours and winning the $1,000 first place prize. These two locals won the last two years and this year won in Leadville and Buena Vista too, collectively known as the Triple Crown.\n\nBreaking in\n\n\"In the whole world, there are probably fewer than 1,000 people who have ever competed in a pack-burro race,\" the late Denver Post columnist Ed Quillen wrote in 2007 , arguing for it to be the state's official sport. (In 2012, pack burro racing was designated a summer heritage sport of Colorado.)\n\nIf you want to be among this elite crew, your training is two-fold. You need to condition yourself to run long distances \u2014 putting in the hours on trail runs and at high altitudes -- as the pack burro race is a very challenging course.\n\nThen there is driving a donkey. They don't need to acclimate to the altitude or learn how to properly fuel themselves with calories and hydration to go the distance. But runners still benefit with getting as many miles together as possible.\n\nThere are techniques and personality differences among the animals that need to be m-ass-tered to have a successful run. \"If the burro doesn't trust you, or like you, or you are pushing too hard,\" said Wann, \"it's not going to work.\"\n\nOrganizers don't recommend it but you can show up the day before a burro pack race and rent a donkey. Amber Wann, a self described \"donkey matchmaker\" and wife of Brad, rents them for races and tries to match running speed and equine experience.\n\n\"Burro racing is a very mental game,\" he added. \"We're navigating through some of the roughest terrain in the world and you have to build a relationship with your ass to make that happen.\"\n\nRunning with a donkey is a bit of give and take, literally. Sometimes you're pulling them, other times they're pulling you. Uphill they can be a real ass-et if they are in the lead and pulling a bit. But going downhill, runners want to be in the lead lest they find themselves getting dragged by a fast and enthusiastic 900-pound burro which can haul ass at speeds up to 40 miles per hour.\n\nOn flats, either teammate can be in the lead, or side-by-side, but human runners are still doing the steering.\n\nYou control a donkey through their nose, pulling back on the rope to slow down, like a gas pedal of pressure-and-release to change speed. A whistle or a \"hup-hup!\" can get 'em goin' and the classic \"whoa\" can slow 'em down. The donkey of course doesn't know where it's going. Humans are the \"GPS for the critters,\" Wann said.\n\nGear-wise, runners need the right shoes, clothes, running vests and fuel for an ultramarathon. And the burros, in addition to getting a clean bill of health from a vet, need the old timey mining equipment and added weight to carry.\n\nAss-essing risk and reward\n\nAs with any ultramarathon trail run, injuries are always possible. According to a 2015 study involving 1,212 active ultrarunners, they suffered about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners , though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.\n\nBeing tethered to a donkey adds risk of injury to runners, of course. If you trip, you can get serious road rash from getting dragged along. One year a runner bruised or broke some ribs when her burro kicked her in the chest.\n\nThe rules don't allow runners to ride the donkey, but in the race's history, injured runners have been carried down the mountain on their partners' back, as they're out of the race anyway.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDonkeys get injured too, but in 70 years of racing, not one animal has died or been injured beyond recovery.\n\nAnimal rights groups have raised eyebrows about the sport but organizers stress the humane treatment of the burros. \"Any contestant mistreating his animal may be disqualified,\" the race rules state. \"No needles, electric prods, narcotics, clubs or whips, other than the halter rope, may be used.\" But the runners' love for their donkey partners makes this rule seemingly superfluous.\n\nOrganizers also point out that donkeys enjoy the race as much as the ultra-runners. \"If you observe donkeys in the wild, they aren't sedentary creatures,\" wrote Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation member Sheri L. Thompson on the sport's race website. \"In the wild, donkeys are very trim athletic animals\" and \"they exercise all day long.\"\n\n\"They are willing participants,\" Thompson writes, alluding to the burro's famous stubbornness. \"If they don't want to go, you can't make them do anything.\"",

If you're just starting out, keep these things in mind to help you increase your chances of running success.\n\nDoing too much too soon\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes newbie runners make is doing too much too soon. Picking up a new hobby like running is no doubt exciting, but novice runners need to ease into the sport by building up a mileage base before increasing the distance, intensity, and frequency of their runs. Slowly easing into a training program will help reduce the risk of injury, so you can continue on with your new running routine. Many experts suggest increasing your mileage by no more than 10% each week.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "It's our emotional intelligence that gives us the ability to read our instinctive feelings and those of others. It also allows us to understand and label emotions as well as express and regulate them, according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.\n\nMost of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.\n\nBut many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence, according to Brackett, a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.\n\nThat's important because experts say the ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health, happiness and personal and professional success.\n\nSo maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.\n\nWhat is emotional intelligence?\n\nThe theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey, the 23rd president of Yale University, and John \"Jack\" Mayer, professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire, wrote up the theory in 1990, Brackett said.\n\nTheir work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior, said Robin Stern, associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator, author and licensed psychoanalyst.\n\nExperts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. \"Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions,\" she said.\n\nIt's having an awareness of how your emotions drive your decisions and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others, said Sara Canaday, a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic, can look at situations from an alternative point of view, are considered open-minded, bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face, according to Canaday.\n\n\"Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world,\" Stern said.\n\n\"People with more emotional intelligence are healthier, happier and more effective,\" Brackett said.\n\nWhy emotional intelligence matters\n\nCanaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a high IQ score\n\nWait, really?\n\nWell ... just reflect on your own work experiences, Canaday suggests.\n\nHas anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave, even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?\n\n\"We might be hired for technical talents, but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence,\" Canaday said.\n\nIndividuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful, she said, but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence.\n\n\"It is how well you can collaborate, how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell, the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart.\"\n\nEmotional intelligence tests\n\nBehavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments, usually broken down into \"your ability to manage yourself, your ability to manage relationships, your self-awareness and your social awareness,\" according to Canaday.\n\nYour results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence.\n\nBut Brackett warns that \"measurement is a tricky subject.\"\n\nIn his early research, he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence, which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment, people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way, their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them.\n\nAnother form of an emotional intelligence test is a \"360 assessment.\"\n\nIn the workplace setting, a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often \"see ourselves differently than others do.\"\n\nWhen a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser, perhaps a current or former boss, to evaluate your emotional intelligence, she said.\n\nBut, Canaday cautions, If you ask for someone's feedback, be prepared to accept what they share. \"This stuff can feel very personal. On one hand, we say we want to learn and grow, but on the other hand, we want to be accepted just the way we are, and those two human traits run counter.\"\n\nCan I improve my emotional intelligence?\n\nSo maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that?\n\nFrom the earliest ages, children should be taught how to recognize their emotions, understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to express and manage themselves , Stern said.\n\nFor adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence, improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. \"Pick one or two areas where you want to grow, and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop.\"\n\nIf you are trying to gain better control of your anger, for example, you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be yoga meditation or boxing\n\nCanaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. \"Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do, then you are hearing the same conversations, and you are not growing, and you are not learning to be open to perspectives.\"\n\nBrackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to \"spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions, be more self- and socially aware about your presence.\"\n\nStern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause, slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"There is no question in my mind that if people were to really appreciate how important emotions are, allowed themselves to have emotions, made space for other people to have their emotions and handled those emotions skillfully in the service of making a better world, we would in fact have a better world.\"",

    "text": "Have you ever waited with excitement to share some amazingly good news with your partner, only to experience a surge of frustration and resentment when he or she barely reacts to your announcement? As a society, we place a huge amount of emphasis on being there for each other when we're in need, but past research has actually shown that relationship satisfaction is influenced as much, if not more, by how we react to each other's good news. Whereas emotional support from a partner when we're down can have the unfortunate side-effect of making us feel indebted and more aware of our negative emotions, a partner's positive reaction to our good news can magnify the benefits of that good fortune and make us feel closer to them.\n\nNow an unusual brain-imaging study , published in Human Brain Mapping, has added to this picture, showing that the relationship satisfaction of longtime married elderly women is particularly related to the neural activity they show in response to their husbands' displays of positive emotion, rather than negative emotion.\n\nPsychologist Raluca Petrican at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto and her colleagues at the University of Toronto recruited 14 women with an average age of 72 who'd been married for an average of 40 years. The researchers scanned these women's brains as they watched some carefully prepared videos.\n\nThe silent 10-second videos showed each woman's husband or a stranger displaying an emotion that mismatched the way the video clip was labeled in a one-sentence description on the screen. For example, the clip might show the husband smiling or laughing about a happy memory (such as the first house they bought), but the video was labeled misleadingly to suggest that the man was showing this emotion while talking about a sad memory (such as the time he got fired). Other videos showed the reverse mismatch: a negative emotional display, ostensibly shown while talking about the memory of a happy event.\n\nEssentially, the videos were designed to make the women feel like they were seeing their husband or the stranger display a surprising emotional reaction that didn't match their own feelings. The real-world equivalent would be a situation in which a husband is happy about something that his wife doesn't \"get\"; and the questions are whether she will notice, and whether she is she more sensitive to this incongruent emotion in her husband than she would be in a stranger.\n\nThe first important finding to emerge from this setup was that the women showed enhanced overall brain activity -- which suggests more mental and emotional neural processing -- when watching the videos of their husbands compared with videos of the strangers, but only when the videos showed displays of surprisingly incongruent positive emotion. During the other types of videos (when the men appeared to display strangely negative emotion), the women's brains showed just as much overall activity when watching a stranger as when watching their husband. In other words, their levels of whole-brain activity betrayed a special sensitivity to their husband's (versus a stranger's) unexpected positive emotion.\n\nThis jibes with the past research that's shown it's our response to our partners' positive news that is all-important for relationship satisfaction. Remember that these women had been married for decades, so it's likely that they and their husbands have been doing something right relationship-wise. The brain-imaging data suggest part of the reason might be that the women are acutely tuned to when their husbands are showing happiness that's personal to them (rather than common to both partners).\n\nThis specific interpretation trips up a little with another main result: The women's levels of marital satisfaction (according to a questionnaire) correlated with the amount of neural processing they showed in response to their husbands positive and negative emotion.\n\nHowever, the special importance of how we respond to our partners' positive emotion was supported by another key finding. Namely, women who scored higher on relationship satisfaction showed more brain activation in regions thought to contain mirror neurons (neurons that are considered important for empathy) when watching their spouses than they did when watching a stranger. Moreover, this enhanced mirror-neuron activity was especially present for the videos showing their husbands' positive, rather than negative, emotion. Again, this appears to support the idea that marital happiness goes hand in hand with sensitivity to our partners' positive emotion (though the researchers acknowledge a different or complementary interpretation that people in happy relationships have a suppressed response to their partners' incongruent negative emotion).\n\nWe need to interpret these preliminary and complex findings with caution. And the exclusive focus on wives' reactions to their husbands' emotions does lend the study a slightly retro '70s vibe -- what about the way that husbands respond to their wives' emotions, and the importance of that for the marital happiness of both parties? But that said, the results are tantalizing in suggesting that at a neural level, people in a long-term, committed relationship are especially sensitive to their partners' positive emotion, and particularly so when this emotion is different from their own. This neatly complements other past research showing, for example, that people who are unable to differentiate their partners' emotions from their own (they assume they're the same), tend to be viewed by their partners as more controlling and smothering.\n\nAs a whole, this entire body of research gives pause for thought. How do you react when your partner arrives home on an emotional high? Would you only notice if you were feeling happy too?",

    "text": "(CNN) Your stamina -- or the time it takes for you to reach peak exhaustion during exercise -- can be tied to your dementia risk, and a new study reveals how.\n\nThe study, published Wednesday in the medical journal Neurology , found that women with high cardiovascular fitness, or high stamina, had an 88% lower risk of dementia than women who were moderately fit.\n\n\"I was not surprised that there was an association, but I was surprised that it was such a strong association between the group with highest fitness and decreased dementia risk,\" said Helena H\u00f6rder, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, who was first author on the study.\n\nDementia is the name for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain , often leading to memory loss or other problems with brain function. Alzheimer's disease , an irreversible and progressive brain disease, is the most common type of dementia.\n\nAbout 5.4 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease , and it is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAbout 850,000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia as a whole, according to the UK's National Health Service\n\nWorldwide, about 50 million people have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year, according to the World Health Organization\n\nJUST WATCHED How Alzheimer's disease destroys the brain Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How Alzheimer's disease destroys the brain 01:38\n\nThe new study involved 191 women in Sweden, 38 to 60 years old, who completed an ergometer cycling test to evaluate their cardiovascular fitness.\n\nDuring the test, the women's workload was measured, based on how much weight or resistance could be added to the bicycle before they became fatigued.\n\n\"The level that you are so exhausted that you have to interrupt the test is a measure, in watts, of your work capacity,\" H\u00f6rder said. \"Cardiovascular fitness or endurance can also be tested in a submaximal test where you don't push the person to maximal capacity.\"\n\nSome of the women had to interrupt their cycling test at submaximal workload, before being pushed to maximal capacity, mainly due to changes seen on an electrocardiograph or due to high blood pressure.\n\nBased on their crude peak workload, the women were separated into three groups: Fifty-nine were in the \"low fitness\" group, 92 were \"medium fitness,\" and 40 were \"high fitness.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How to prevent Alzheimer's disease Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to prevent Alzheimer's disease 03:33\n\nThose cycling tests were conducted in 1968, and the women were followed over a 44-year period until 2012. During that time, the researchers tracked the women's health, taking a close look at who was diagnosed with dementia and who was not.\n\nThe researchers found that among all of the women, 44 of them (or 23%) developed dementia from 1968 to 2012. Yet among those who interrupted their cycling test at submaximal workload, that percentage jumped to 45%.\n\n\"Many of those who interrupted the test at submax, very low watt level, probably had indications for a poor cardiovascular health status,\" H\u00f6rder said. \"This might indicate that processes in the cardiovascular system might be ongoing many decades before onset of dementia diagnosis.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that the average age at dementia onset was 11 years older in the \"high fitness\" group than in the \"medium fitness\" group, and the most pronounced risk reduction was seen among those with the highest fitness: \"High compared to medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that it involved a small sample of women in Sweden. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would occur in a larger, more diverse group.\n\nAlso, the findings were not causal. So more research is also needed to determine whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when in life a high fitness level is most important.\n\nFor instance, other factors could have influenced the findings to help lower dementia risk, regardless of physical activity habits. Genetics or the cognitive stimulation of fitness could have influenced dementia risk, as well as the social aspects of fitness, as loneliness has been linked to dementia\n\n\"One of the missing pieces of a study like this -- and really the weakness in the literature to date -- is that the kinds of studies that we have mostly seen are association studies. These are studies of correlations, and they can't necessarily talk about causality,\" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nStill, he said, \"the picture that is really emerging from the literature is a picture about the importance of fitness in midlife, not just old age, when it comes to protecting your brain health and preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.\"\n\nThe new study adds to that overall growing body of evidence turning a spotlight on dementia and modifiable risk factors , such as poor cardiovascular health, a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, smoking or excessive alcohol consumption\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSo people could try to reduce their risk of cognitive decline by engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise , stopping smoking, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, staying socially engaged, challenging their minds by reading or playing games and of course taking care of their heart health, according to the Alzheimer's Association\n\n\"There's a very strong connection between cardiovascular health -- so the health of your heart and your circulatory system -- and the health of your brain,\" Fargo said.\n\n\"The reason for that is because the brain actually is what we would call a highly vascularized organ, meaning that your brain has many blood vessels,\" he said. \"The demand for nutrient-, oxygen-rich blood in the brain is very high compared to other organs, and so anything a person can do to increase their cardiovascular fitness level is likely to have positive benefits on brain health.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) High-intensity interval training will be the No. 1 fitness trend in the coming year, while smartphone exercise apps that prompt your activities will be out -- or so says the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018 .\n\nSuch training, known as HIIT, typically involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a short period of rest or recovery: intermittently sprinting for 30 seconds, for example, during a moderate-pace jog.\n\nThe US national physical activity guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week with additional muscle-strengthening exercise for adults and 60 minutes a day for children, noted Walter R. Thompson, author of the report and prtesident of the American College of Sports Medicine. \"So if you step it up a little bit and get your heart rate up and move from, say, walking to jogging, it decreases to 75 minutes per week.\"\n\nHIIT is a worthy way to meet your physical activity guidelines, he said. \"But there's a word of caution with that: Anytime you do high-intensity anything, there may be an increased risk of injury.\"\n\nIf you doubt your ability to safely exercise in high-intensity bursts, Thompson recommends that you \"get a good physical exam\" before starting a program.\n\nOver the past 12 years, the editors of the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal have circulated an electronic survey to thousands of professionals, including personal trainers and physical therapists, to predict the biggest health and fitness trends for the coming year.\n\nThis year's survey, which included responses from 4,133 fitness professionals around the globe, placed \"group training\" -- classes involving more than five participants -- in the No. 2 slot. Meanwhile, \"wearable technology\" -- such as activity trackers and smartwatches -- came in third, and \"body weight training\" -- the use of your own body weight as a form of resistance while doing modified pushups and other exercises -- came in fourth. \"Strength training,\" or the use of barbells and weights, placed fifth.\n\nThompson said the survey was developed for two purposes, the first being \"to help guide the fitness industry.\"\n\nAlthough most of the industry is \"commercial properties,\" the survey is also helpful to community-based organizations, corporate wellness programs and medical fitness centers.\n\n\"They need some direction as to what will be the next trend in the industry so that when they use their valuable resources for something, they know it's going to work,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"We also do it from the perspective of people who use the gym, the clients,\" he said. \"It helps them identify gyms across the country that are offering the best kinds of exercise programs.\"\n\nThree new trends found a place on the top 20 list: \"licensure for fitness professionals\", \"core training\" and \"sport-specific Training.\" Licensure refers to the general trend toward more regulation of fitness professionals, such as personal trainers. Core work stresses strength and conditioning of the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen, thorax and back. Sport-specific exercising is usually geared toward younger athletes and focuses on a single sport, such as tennis or boxing.\n\nMeanwhile, \"work-site health promotion\" (which ranked 16th in last year's survey) and \"outcomes measures\" (previously 18th) fell from the top 20 list. In other words, incentive programs in employer-based health care benefits plans and comparison measurements to improve performance are no longer fashionable among the gym set.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises on the 2018 list was the \"re-emergence of group exercise programs,\" said Thompson, who remembers \"back in the day when that was all we did.\"\n\nPersonal training, which was introduced around 2000, reduced the popularity of group training, he noted. However, after the recession, less expensive group training sessions re-emerged and apparently continue to thrive. \"It's got to help increase revenue and decrease expenses,\" Thompson said.\n\nAnother trend for 2018 will be older adults being welcomed back into fitness clubs.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMost gyms \"still see their greatest revenue source as the 25- to 35-year-old age bracket,\" Thompson said. But the \"really smart clubs\" are changing music and lighting during slower times when the typical gym-goer is at work, \"so that now, the 60-year-old feels comfortable going into the gym,\" he said. \"It makes total sense.\"\n\nFinally, yoga remains in the top 10, where it has been since the survey started, Thompson said. \"Yoga keeps reinventing itself.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) When Christopher Michael Everett went to his first SoulCycle class, he gave it his all. He sat in the front of the class, cranked the resistance on his bike and started pedaling.\n\nWithin the first five to 10 minutes, his thighs began to hurt and feel abnormal. But he powered through the pain and stuck it out until the end of the class.\n\n\"They say go big or go home. I probably should have went home,\" said Everett, a 33-year-old actor in Los Angeles.\n\nFor the rest of the day, he felt OK, but the following night was marred by excruciating thigh pain. Unable to sleep, he searched for \"Spin class and sore legs\" and came across a personal account written by a woman who needed to go to the hospital after a cycling class for a condition called rhabdomyolysis.\n\nRhabdomyolysis leads muscle tissue to break down and release a harmful protein into the bloodstream. Everett recognized the symptoms she mentioned, such as soreness, swollen thighs, nausea and an inability to bend the knees. He had all of them except dark brown urine , which he was not about to wait for, he said.\n\nEverett immediately went to the ER and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. He stayed in the hospital for a week.\n\nWhat is rhabdomyolysis?\n\nRhabdomyolysis quite literally means \"breakdown of muscle,\" said Dr. Derek Fine, associate professor of medicine and interim chief of nephrology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. When the muscle breaks down, it releases myoglobin, a protein that can poison the kidneys, into the bloodstream.\n\nThe condition is caused by any type of trauma to the muscle. There are also toxins in some medications and illicit drugs that can cause it, he said. The first descriptions of the condition were among people who had been trapped under bombed buildings during World War II, Fine said.\n\nRecently, strenuous exercise has been popping up as another common culprit, seen in people who do activities like Spinning, P90X, CrossFit, weightlifting and running.\n\n\"I've had patients come in who can't walk. They can't get out of bed. They call 911 because their muscles don't work,\" Fine said.\n\nIn rhabdomyolysis cases that are easier to treat, the patient is given fluids to rehydrate and released from the hospital after a few days of monitoring, Fine said.\n\nEverett said he was hooked up to an IV and pumped with fluids for seven days to flush out the toxins in his kidneys. He was not released until his levels of CPK -- creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that leaks into the blood when muscle tissue is damaged -- were normal.\n\nWorst-case scenario\n\nIf the condition is really severe, the kidneys may shut down, and the patient could end up on dialysis. With kidney failure comes the risk of an overload of potassium in the body, which could lead to abnormal heart rhythms and death.\n\nIn April, the American Journal of Medicine released a study on three cases of rhabdomyolysis that were caused by Spinning classes. In one case, a 33-year-old kindergarten teacher was put on dialysis when she had kidney failure and experienced fluid overload from her hydration treatment.\n\n\"It's tough to tell somebody who's 33 years old, 'I need to start you on dialysis.' And so you treat them with a lot of fluids, and you hopefully get them to the point where their kidneys open up and they start getting rid of the toxins and they don't have to go on dialysis,\" said Dr. Alan Coffino, a nephrologist and chairman of medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and a co-author of the study. He treated the 33-year-old. \"In her case, we had to pull the plug and put her on dialysis.\"\n\nAfter two weeks, her kidneys opened up, and she was released from the hospital.\n\nAnother potential symptom of rhabdomyolysis is compartment syndrome, Coffino said, which is when muscles swell and are unable to expand. In some cases, surgery is needed to release pressure from the muscle.\n\nEverett said the swelling of his thighs concerned the doctor. \"He was like, 'if your thighs get any more swollen, we're going to have to cut those open,' \" he said. But the swelling did not increase, and Everett was able to avoid surgery.\n\nHow to avoid rhabdomyolysis\n\nPeople who work out regularly can get rhabdomyolysis, Coffino said, as well as those who don't exercise often. Those who are fit typically get it if they push themselves too hard or if they try a new exercise that works a different muscle group. The study he co-authored points out that of the 46 people documented in medical literature who got rhabdomyolysis from a Spin class, 42 developed it after their first class.\n\nEverett worked out every two to three days and considers himself fit, but he had never taken a Spin class before.\n\n\"I just wish SoulCycle would have said at the beginning of the class, 'if you work out too hard, this can happen to you,' \" Everett said. Its been one month since he was hospitalized, and his legs are still sore.\n\nSoulCycle has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nAlthough any type of extreme exercise can lead to the condition, the popularity of Spinning is what concerns Dr. Maureen Brogan, associate professor of medicine at New York Medical College, nephrologist at Westchester Medical Center and the lead author of the study.\n\n\"I mean, Spinning, you burn 600 calories in an hour, and you lose up to a liter an hour of sweat,\" Brogan said. \"Six hundred calories is like running six miles. So if you're not conditioned, you wouldn't just run six miles.\"\n\nOne of her patients developed rhabdomyolysis after spending only 15 minutes on a bike.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRhabdomyolysis can occur at any age and in both men and women. In Brogan's Spinning study, it was more common in females, but that's because more women tend to participate in the exercise, she said.\n\nTo avoid the condition, it is important to be slow and gradual when beginning a new type of workout, she said. When going to a class, you should tell the instructor if you are new, and make sure to hydrate before, during and after exercising.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be damaging to the kidneys, so they shouldn't be taken after an intense workout, Brogan said. If someone does develop rhabdomyolysis, it could worsen their condition.\n\n\"It's better just to err on the side of caution and take things slowly,\" Brogan said.",

She said, 'Have you ever walked a cat?'\"\n\nMeeting Peety\n\nEric went home armed with new recipes and an order to visit his local animal shelter.\n\nHe went to the shelter with visions of the perfect dog dancing through his head, one that never barked or shed or disobeyed commands.\n\nAnd then the adoption coordinator brought in an obese dog with skin problems.\n\nEric O'Grey with Peety, the shelter dog he adopted.\n\n\"His head was hung low and he wasn't even looking up. He was just obviously depressed,\" O'Grey said. \"The dog looked up at me with a clear sense of disappointment I'd never seen on any person or creature.\"\n\nThe adoption coordinator told him they had a lot in common and both needed to work on the same things.\n\n\"'You told me you want to lose weight and get outside more,\" she said. \"This dog needs the same thing. So this is the dog that I am recommending for you.\"\n\nO'Grey took the dog home and named him \"Peety\" after the pup in \"The Little Rascals.\" And they began going on walks.\n\nA bond is formed\n\nAt first, O'Grey could only take his new sidekick about 100 yards before he'd turn back, huffing and puffing and embarrassed.\n\nBut Peety seemed to like it.\n\n\"He just looked up at me like he was so appreciative.\"\n\nTheir twice-daily walks gradually got longer as Eric began to enjoy his strolls through a neighborhood he'd never explored on foot before.\n\nAnd Peety, with his striking white and black markings, was a great conversation starter.\n\n\"I called him my weapon of mass seduction because everybody wanted to meet him,\" O'Grey said. \"We would walk around town and these women would say, 'Hey, do you mind if I pet your dog?'\"\n\nAs they lost weight and grew healthier together, the pair developed a tight bond.\n\n\"I decided to become the person who he thought that I was. And over time really every part of my life improved,\" O'Grey said. \"I was so reclusive and removed from society at the time that I needed a relationship in my life.\n\n\"It turned on certain emotions in me that I'd never really felt before.\"\n\nFrom couch potato to marathoner\n\nIn less than six months, Eric quit all the medications he was taking.\n\nHe barely knew how to boil water, but he learned how to cook the spicy, vegetarian recipes his naturopathic doctor gave him.\n\nJUST WATCHED Plant-based diet and heart health Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Plant-based diet and heart health 00:59\n\n\"I really began liking my new foods much better than my old foods,\" he said. \"My palate changed entirely and I started craving spicy foods.\"\n\nAnd in 10 months, he dropped from 340 pounds to 185 pounds.\n\nEric began going on dates for the first time in 15 years. He had so much extra energy with his leaner body and healthier diet that he joined a club of runners.\n\n\"I was bouncing off the walls, I just had more energy than I could handle,\" he said.\n\nOver time O'Grey discovered that he loved long-distance running. Today he runs an average of five to six marathons a year.\n\nBut he's quick to emphasize that his weight loss didn't come from running. Healthy eating and two walks a day with Peety did that.\n\nIn March 2015, Peety died of cancer. O'Grey calls it the \"the saddest day of my life.\"\n\nA new exercise buddy\n\nToday O'Grey lives in Boise, Idaho, where he cooks up dishes like vegetarian paella with purple carrots and marinated tofu. His kitchen has large bins of exotic spices.\n\nHe is an evangelist for three things: cooking with fresh veggies and lots of spices, long-distance running and dog adoption.\n\nFive months after Peety died, he found solace by adopting a new exercise buddy. Jake, with his shiny black coat, lean frame and boundless energy, is a good match for the new, healthy Eric.\n\nEric O'Grey and Jake, the dog he adopted after Peety died.\n\nLast year O'Grey rekindled a relationship with his high school sweetheart and got married.\n\nIt's been seven years since he started his journey toward a healthier, happier life. He is 58 years old but he says he feels more like 25.\n\nAnd for others struggling with obesity, Eric offers this encouragement.\n\n\"It's never too late to turn it around,\" he said.",

    "text": "The world is obsessed with fad diets and weight loss, yet few of us know how a kilogram of fat actually vanishes off the scales.\n\nEven the 150 doctors, dietitians and personal trainers we surveyed shared this surprising gap in their health literacy . The most common misconception by far, was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter, which all chemical reactions obey.\n\nSome respondents thought fat turns into muscle, which is impossible, and others assumed it escapes via the colon. Only three of our respondents gave the right answer, which means 98% of the health professionals in our survey could not explain how weight loss works.\n\nSo if not energy, muscles or the loo, where does fat go?\n\nThe enlightening facts about fat metabolism\n\nThe correct answer is that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water. You exhale the carbon dioxide and the water mixes into your circulation until it's lost as urine or sweat.\n\nIf you lose 10 pounds of fat, precisely 8.4 pounds comes out through your lungs and the remaining 1.6 pounds turns into water. In other words, nearly all the weight we lose is exhaled.\n\nThis surprises just about everyone, but actually, almost everything we eat comes back out via the lungs. Every carbohydrate you digest and nearly all the fats are converted to carbon dioxide and water. The same goes for alcohol.\n\nProtein shares the same fate, except for the small part that turns into urea and other solids, which you excrete as urine.\n\nThe only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and, after that, it's not going anywhere until you've vaporised it.\n\nKilograms in versus kilograms out\n\nWe all learn that \"energy in equals energy out\" in high school. But energy is a notoriously confusing concept, even among health professionals and scientists who study obesity\n\nThe reason we gain or lose weight is much less mysterious if we keep track of all the kilograms, too, not just those enigmatic kilojoules or calories.\n\nAccording to the latest government figures, Americans consume 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and beverages every day. Of that, 430 grams (about 15 ounces) is solid macronutrients , 17 grams (0.6 ounces) is fibre and the remaining 3.11 kg (110 ounces) is water\n\nWhat's not reported is that we inhale more than 660 grams (23 ounces) worth of oxygen, too, and this figure is equally important for your waistline.\n\nIf you put 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and water into your body, plus 660 grams of oxygen (23 ounces), then 4.2 kg (148 ounces) of stuff needs to come back out, or you'll gain weight. If you're hoping to shed some weight, more than 4.1kg will have to go.\n\nThe 430 grams (15.2 ounces) of carbohydrates, fats, protein and alcohol most Americans eat every day will produce exactly 770 grams (27.1 ounces) of carbon dioxide plus 290 grams (10.2 ounces) of water (about one cup) and about 31 grams (1.1 ounces) of urea and other solids excreted as urine.\n\nAn average 75kg (165 pound) person's resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body uses energy when the person isn't moving) produces about 590 grams (21 ounces) of carbon dioxide per day. No pill or potion you can buy will increase that figure, despite the bold claims you might have heard.\n\nThe good news is that you exhale 200 grams (7 ounces) of carbon dioxide while you're fast asleep every night, so you've already breathed out a quarter of your daily target before you even step out of bed.\n\nEat less, exhale more\n\nSo if fat turns into carbon dioxide, could simply breathing more make you lose weight? Unfortunately not. Huffing and puffing more than you need to is called hyperventilation and will only make you dizzy, or possibly faint. The only way you can consciously increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body is producing is by moving your muscles.\n\nBut here's some more good news. Simply standing up and getting dressed more than doubles your metabolic rate. In other words, if you simply tried on all your outfits for 24 hours, you'd exhale more than 1,200 grams (42 ounces) of carbon dioxide.\n\nMore realistically, going for a walk triples your metabolic rate, and so will cooking, vacuuming and sweeping\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMetabolising 100 ounces of fat consumes 290 ounces of oxygen and produces 280 ounces of carbon dioxide plus 110 ounces of water. The food you eat can't change these figures.\n\nTherefore, to lose 100 ounces of fat, you have to exhale 280 ounces of carbon dioxide on top of what you'll produce by vaporising all your food, no matter what you eat.\n\nAny diet that supplies less \"fuel\" than you burn will do the trick, but with so many misconceptions about how weight loss works, few of us know why.",

    "text": "Story highlights Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures, experts say\n\nCooking for others can be viewed as a nurturing act that comes with the benefit of increased happiness\n\n(CNN) We say it before we end a phone call. We type it in our texts. It's the last words we speak before we say good night. \"I love you\" is possibly the most popular three-word phrase in the world, spoken millions of times every day.\n\n\"I love you\" translates intimacy between ourselves and others, but the expression is so common that it can lack the meaning it's intended. When saying and hearing it becomes automatic and expected, its power becomes dulled in our brain's limbic system, where we process love.\n\nPsychologist Abraham Maslow created a \"hierarchy of needs\" that ranks what humans are motivated to achieve, with love cited as a basic need after safety, food and shelter. A human's need for love carries a weight within us that isn't always an emotion. It can be an overall warmth, a deep sense of belonging, an underlying connectedness or confirmation of adoration between people.\n\nStill how do we arrive at a loving state?\n\nResearchers from Penn State University found that feeling loved isn't just about saying or hearing \"I love you.\" Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures. According to a recent study, behavioral expressions trump verbal ones when it comes to transmitting that loving feeling. \"It is possible for people to feel loved in simple, everyday scenarios,\" explained the study's lead researcher, Zita Oravecz. \"It doesn't have to be over-the-top gestures.\"\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) After competing in \"The Biggest Loser,\" many of the reality-show contestants have reluctantly regained the weight they sought to lose through extreme dieting and exercise.\n\n\"The truth is, I kind of spiraled,\" Ali Vincent, the first woman to win the competition, told Oprah last year. \"I got home and I was like, 'What do I do?'\n\n\"I'm supposed to be strong. I'm supposed to know how to do this.\"\n\nBut some contestants discovered for themselves the key to keeping their weight down long after the cameras turned off, according to a study published Monday.\n\nSix years after appearing on the show, a group of 14 contestants had kept off a median 13% of their original body weight. The researchers split the group in two -- the \"maintainers,\" who had kept a substantial amount of the weight off, and the \"regainers,\" who did not -- and looked at what set them apart.\n\n\"Did they cut more calories from their diet ... or did they become more physically active?\" asked study author Kevin Hall , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nHall had been \"puzzled by how quickly the contestants were losing weight.\" So he contacted the show's physician and began studying the season eight contestants.\n\nEarly on, Hall observed that weight loss was better predicted by food intake, not physical activity alone. But in the long term, the opposite was true.\n\n\"You have to be very physically active in order to keep the weight off,\" Hall said.\n\nThe \"maintainers,\" who kept off about 25% of their preshow weight on average, increased their physical activity by roughly 160% from before the competition. Those who regained the weight increased their activity only 34%. They were 1.1% heavier on average than their original weight.\n\nThe researchers couldn't find any major differences between the food intake of both groups; both cut their calories by about the same amount.\n\n\"While we know that the most important aspect of helping one lose weight is the dietary intake, that is pretty much reversed when it comes to weight loss maintenance,\" said Dr. Jennifer Kraschnewski , associate professor of medicine and public health sciences at the Penn State College of Medicine. She was not involved in the study.\n\nHall's findings echo previous studies that promote more exercise for long-term weight loss maintenance. However, experts caution that doesn't mean people can neglect their diets in the long run, either.\n\nTo maintain the weight loss, Hall's team estimated that contestants would need to engage in 80 minutes of moderate activity or 35 minutes of vigorous activity each day beyond what they were doing at baseline.\n\nThe researchers didn't observe the contestants working out directly. They used tools like traceable water molecules to figure out how much energy was expended -- the \"gold standard\" measurements in this type of research, Kraschnewski said. Many larger studies have instead asked people to self-report how much they exercised, which can be riddled with errors.\n\nThis method, however, was not able to tell how much of the physical activity was due to normal daily activities -- like cleaning the house or walking the dog -- versus following a workout plan, Hall said.\n\nPart of the reason the contestants' weight rebounded was because of \"metabolic slowing,\" Hall said. As contestants lost weight during the competition, their bodies burned fewer calories than expected.\n\n\"This can make it more difficult to lose weight and is another hurdle to overcome,\" Kraschnewski said. After going on a very low-calorie diet, \"the body's mechanisms kick in to preserve body mass at all costs.\"\n\nSix years later, however, the contestants' resting metabolisms still hadn't sped back up, Hall showed in a study last year.\n\nThis is a stark difference from people who have had gastric bypass surgery for weight loss, whose metabolisms may speed back up in a year's time, Kraschnewski said. Researchers are trying to figure out why this is -- and it may have something to do with the intricate connections between the gut, brain and hormones that regulate hunger, Kraschnewski added.\n\nFor Hall, metabolic changes are just one part of the puzzle. Genetics may also play a role, as well as social factors that can make it hard for some people to incorporate so much exercise in their daily lives.\n\n\"To do that requires a huge investment of time and energy,\" he said. \"The bar is set very high for those folks to be able to maintain the weight loss without surgery or drugs.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHall added that it's not necessarily those who were most physically active during the competition who kept it up six years later.\n\n\"You can't really reproduce the expectation that those individuals must have had on the show to lose weight -- the pressure,\" Kraschnewski said.\n\n\"The take-home point here is that obesity really is a disease,\" she said. \"It's not something that you can treat once and will cure it. It's something that has to be continually addressed in one's life.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) I'm often asked when couples should consider therapy. It's common for one partner to be unhappy, feel disconnected or feel that their needs for intimacy aren't being met.\n\nBut rather than communicate about it, that partner may open up a metaphorical window with someone else and begin an affair. By the time the couple comes to therapy, the affair itself becomes the main topic, and its underlying causes are often ignored.\n\nThe same scenario rings true for other sources of contention, from financial disagreements to sexual concerns. It's clear that couples shouldn't wait until they're in crisis mode to come to therapy, but what should they do?\n\nWhen is the right time to see a therapist?\n\nCouples should seek therapy long before they think they \"need\" to. Most experts believe that therapy can be an important part of your relationship. \"Most issues within a couple start small and then grow in size when they don't get resolved. This is where therapy can help, by giving tools and techniques to improve conflict resolution,\" explained Kristie Overstreet, a licensed mental health counselor. \"The majority of couples that I work with say that they should have started therapy years earlier.\"\n\n\"There are three sides to every story: his side, her side and the truth,\" psychotherapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson agreed. \"An objective third party can be just the ticket when couples feel they can no longer communicate effectively.\"\n\nRather than viewing therapy as the solution to a crisis, look at it as an integral aspect of a healthy life, suggested Ashley N. Grinonneau-Denton, marriage and family therapist.\n\n\"Every couple should take preventive measures to maintain health in their relationship, just like going to the gym,\" she said. \"If couples don't work their relational and emotional 'muscles,' they become un-toned, weak and create more of a chance of damage being done to their relationship.\"\n\nWhat happens during couples therapy?\n\nAlthough every therapist is different, there are some commonalities. The first session typically involves the therapist getting to know you, discussing the areas of the relationship they hope to improve and setting goals.\n\nSome, but not all, therapists will assign homework for the couples to work on before the next session. \"Ideally, most of the work gets done, in my experience, outside of my office,\" psychotherapist Samantha Manewitz said.\n\nWhat problems can benefit from therapy?\n\nCouples come to therapy for any number of reasons, but in my experience, in addition to infidelity, the greatest issues include sex, communication, money and major life changes such as getting married or starting a family. Couples therapy is also a good idea if one of you is coping with an issue that might be affecting your relationship (such as depression) or simply if you're feeling stuck and stagnant in your relationship.\n\nTherapy can provide a safe space to talk about sensitive topics such as sex. \"Just like folks can get caught in a negative relational cycle, couples can often also get stuck in a negative sexual cycle,\" said Michael Moran, a certified sex therapist. \"I tell couples that when the sex they're having is worth having, they'll have more of it. And so we need to explore what blocks exist to creating that place between them.\"\n\nCommunication is also a big concern for couples. But simply talking with each other more isn't the answer. \"There is communication, and then there's effective communication,\" explained Sara Nasserzadeh, a psychologist. \"Both parties need to feel heard, soothed, respected and cared for first. We analyze old communication patterns and then replace them with feasible and more effective ones. These are all worked out collaboratively with the couple and within the context of their everyday life.\"\n\nYou might also consider couples therapy to help support you at times of major life change and transition. \"Getting married, becoming parents for the first time, moving, changing jobs, losing jobs, becoming empty-nesters, coping after extramarital affairs, recovering from addiction, caring for aging parents -- all of these transitions can destabilize a couple's equilibrium,\" Anderson said. \"Therapy affords couples an opportunity to negotiate these transitions with as little disruption as possible and to explore and honor what a particular transition means to each partner.\"\n\nAnd don't discount the value of couples therapy in helping you and your partner dig yourselves out of a rut.\n\n\"Therapy allows couples to talk through their feelings and articulate how their relationship may not be meeting their expectations,\" said James C. Wadley, a licensed counselor. \"More often than not, there is some common ground that may have enabled them to be in the relationship. 'Feeling stuck' can shift if both parties are willing to compromise in a way so that individual needs are met.\"\n\nWhat if one partner refuses to go?\n\nThis is a fairly common scenario in couples therapy. How you approach it can make a difference. \"Talk with your partner extensively about why you're feeling you'd like to get into couples therapy,\" Moran said. \"Don't just spring it on them and insist they go.\"\n\nIf they're still hesitant, remember that you can attend therapy on your own. This alone may have a beneficial effect.\n\n\"Instead of waiting for the other person who doesn't want to go to therapy to change, therapy can help strengthen your own self-improvement and personal growth,\" said Marissa Nelson, a marriage and family therapist. The hesitant partner may become impressed by these positive changes and decide to pursue therapy after all.\n\nIf you think your own experiences with therapy have piqued your partner's curiosity, let them know that can see the therapist individually as well. \"Often, by letting them know a safety zone will be created, where their voice is heard and fault or blame isn't the goal, the hesitant partner might feel safe to come in,\" psychotherapist Constance DelGiudice explained.\n\nHow do you know if your therapist is a good fit?\n\nIt helps to do your research before choosing a couples therapist, but the truth is that you won't really know whether they're the right for you and your partner until you get together.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"I often arrange a phone call first with clients to make sure we are potentially a good fit,\" Nasserzadeh said. \"Once you meet, pay attention to the therapist's communication style, the rational behind their questions and their general approach. \"Any homework they assign should be explained clearly and makes sense to you and your line of logic.\"\n\nHow long should therapy last?\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It really depends on the couple and the issues they're working through. For some couples, a few sessions may be all they need to jump-start their relationship, while others may remain in therapy for years.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to see a therapist together until you've met your goals and feel confident that you've gained the skills necessary to navigate the ups and downs of your relationship.",

    "text": "(CNN) Germ-free childhoods followed by infections later in life can trigger the onset of childhood leukemia, a new study suggests.\n\nThe first step is a genetic mutation before birth that predisposes a child to the risk of developing this form of leukemia. The second step is exposure to certain infections later in childhood, after clean early childhoods that limited exposure to infections.\n\nMore specifically, children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the paper says.\n\nThe author, Institute of Cancer Research Professor Mel Greaves, suggests the cancer could be preventable.\n\nGreaves reviewed more than 30 years of research, including his own, on the genetics, cell biology, immunology, epidemiology and animal modeling of childhood leukemia and reached this conclusion. Greaves said he had long wondered \"why or how otherwise healthy children develop leukaemia and whether this cancer is preventable.\"\n\n\"This body of research is a culmination of decades of work, and at last provides a credible explanation for how the major type of childhood leukaemia develops,\" he said in a statement. \"The research strongly suggests that (this cancer) has a clear biological cause, and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed.\"\n\nHowever, other experts warn that more specifics needs to be confirmed and emphasize that hygiene and safety are still crucial.\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia , known as ALL, is a form of blood cancer that is most often diagnosed in children ages zero to 4 years old, though older children and adults can also be diagnosed. It develops quickly, over days or weeks, building up in the blood and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver and nervous system. The main form of treatment is chemotherapy.\n\nRates of the disease are increasing globally. One study estimated there were 53,000 cases worldwide in 2016. Around 5,960 new cases of ALL are estimated to occur in the United States in 2018, with 1,470 deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Each year, around 810 people are diagnosed in the UK , according to Cancer Research UK.\n\nWhile a genetic mutation plays a role in predisposing someone to the disease, just 1% of children born with this mutation go on to develop the disease, according to the paper. Rates are more common in advanced, affluent societies, which suggests the second step could be caused by factors relating to modern life.\n\nPrevious claims have linked electromagnetic waves and other environmental factors to the disease, but Greaves dismissed this link in his paper.\n\nThe body of research \"busts some persistent myths about the causes of leukaemia, such as the damaging but unsubstantiated claims that the disease is commonly caused by exposure to electro-magnetic waves or pollution,\" said Greaves.\n\nGreaves instead believes that when a baby is exposed to infections during its first year, its immune system is strengthened. But later infections, without the initial priming, can trigger leukemia in those with the genetic mutation.\n\nPopulation studies have found that early exposure to infection in infancy such as day care attendance and breastfeeding can protect against ALL, probably by priming the immune system, according to the study.\n\nGreaves emphasized that infection as a cause applies only to ALL. Other types of leukemia, including infant leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, probably have different causal mechanisms.\n\n\"Preventing childhood leukaemia would have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families in the UK and across the globe,\" said Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London.\n\nHowever, other experts are more cautiously hopeful, emphasizing that genetics and pure chance are still significant factors for developing ALL.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"If we could stop this type of leukaemia from happening in the first place it would be enormously exciting, but many more questions still need to be answered in the research lab before we will know for sure whether that could become a reality,\" said Alasdair Rankin, director of research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise.\n\n\"There is no proven link yet with a specific infection,\" said Dr. Donna Lancaster, consultant pediatric oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. \"This [new study] still needs further investigation and any exposure of young children to infection has to be balanced with the risk of the infection.\n\nSheena Cruickshank of the British Society for Immunology also pointed to the potential risk of exposing children to infections, emphasizing that hygiene and safety are still crucial to maintain.\n\n\"It's also important to remember that infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system,\" said Cruickshank in a statement. \"Parents should not be unduly alarmed by this review.\"\n\nThe research may be a step toward developing preventative measures. However, Charles Swanton, chief clinician of Cancer Research UK, stressed that the causes and prevention methods are still unconfirmed.\n\n\"This research sheds light on how a form of childhood blood cancer might develop, implicating a complex combination of genetics and early exposure to germs, dirt, and illness,\" Swanton said. \"We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) If there's one quality I want my girls to have more than any other, it is confidence.\n\nI've seen how important it is in the workplace and in life: Confident people get what they want. They take risks. They are not afraid of failure.\n\nGrowing up as a perfectionist, somewhat fearful of both failure and success, I wish I had the confidence in my teens and early 20s that I have now.\n\nFor all these reasons, I was thrilled when one of my daughters, during the first grade, had to name five words to describe herself. Confident was on her list. I thought then and still think now, \"What can I do to make sure she feels that way when she is a teenager?\"\n\nJournalist, author and speaker Claire Shipman has some answers. In 2014, she and her co-author, Katty Kay, anchor of BBC World News America, published \"The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance -- What Women Should Know.\" The book resonated deeply with women and quickly became a bestseller.\n\nAs Shipman and Kay traveled the country to speak about the book, one of the most common questions they would get was from parents, women and men, who were concerned about their daughters.\n\n\" 'What about my daughter? I see this in my daughter,' \" Shipman said they would say. \"It was just this huge focus on young women and girls. 'What can I be doing with my girls, because I already see she's not this. She's experiencing that.' \"\n\nShipman, who spent a decade at CNN as a White House and international correspondent in the 1990s, said she and Kay did some research and found that there were plenty of books on the topic for parents but not as many specifically written for girls. So they decided to write one for girls in middle school, although it is applicable for girls up through high school, Shipman says.\n\nThey also commissioned an online poll, which backs up what other research has shown.\n\nBetween the ages of 8 and 14, girls' confidence drops by 30%, according to the survey of nearly 1,400 8- to 18-year-olds and their parents and guardians . The survey also found that three out of four teen girls worry about failing,\n\n\"We were surprised at how quickly, how deep that drop is,\" Shipman said. \"And especially because right until age 8, there's really no difference in confidence levels.\"\n\nSo how do we stop this troubling trend?\n\nI asked Shipman, a mom of two, for some advice -- advice she said she's using with her 13-year-old daughter, with good results.\n\n1. Help her get outside her comfort zone and take risks.\n\nOne of the most important things we can do as parents of daughters, Shipman said, is to help them get \"comfortable being uncomfortable.\" Shipman said she and Kay feel that if they do nothing else in this book but get girls to walk away and understand that it's cool to take risks, they will have succeeded.\n\nAs for how to do that, a parent can talk to their daughter about how they approach a risk and some of the ways they can support themselves. \"It's kind of counterintuitive, but just telling yourself 'Oh, you shouldn't be afraid of this' or 'there's nothing scary about it' or 'fake it until you make it,' that doesn't actually help. Risks can be scary,\" Shipman said.\n\nSo encourage your daughter and tell her, \"Yes, it's normal to feel afraid. This is a little frightening, but tell yourself 'I'm just going to do it afraid. I'm just going to do it anyway,' \" Shipman said.\n\n2. Have her keep a list of risks.\n\nHaving your daughter keep a list of the risks she has taken and how she worked through them can be a reminder of what she is capable of, Shipman said. The same holds true for failures: Listing their failures and how they tackled them can be incredibly empowering.\n\nAlso, have them keep a list of some stock phrases that they can tell themselves when they are in a bit of a frightening situation, such as \"I've done something like this before. I can do it. I've got it.\"\n\n3. Remind her of 'failure fixes.'\n\nOur girls need to know that failure will undoubtedly happen and that it's not something they can avoid. But knowing how to deal with it can help. \"We all need a cheat sheet to failure,\" Shipman and Kay write.\n\nThey offer a list of 10 \"failure fixes\" such as \"change the channel.\" Encourage your daughter to do anything that helps her get in a better place, whether that is reading a book, watching TV, listening to music or cuddling with a family pet. This will help distract her from what's happened and help her stop thinking about it over and over again.\n\nAnother fix is putting it in perspective. Shipman talks about an idea she and Kay heard from a middle school counselor, which she called a \"virtual hot air balloon ride.\" Help your daughter envision herself up in the sky with the clouds and looking down at the situation that happened. \"First, that lets her kind of literally put it in perspective, like, 'Wow, look, other things are going on,' and then see it from a different angle and talk about it that way.\"\n\nTrying to keep a sense of humor is also key. Of course, this is not easy when your daughter is melting down after what she considers the biggest failure of her life. But try to help her see that it could be much worse. \"Thoughts like 'at least I didn't forget to put on pants and go to school naked after our roof caved in' ... can remind you that it really could be worse!\" they write.\n\n4. Role model failure and struggle.\n\nOne of the more surprising results (at least to me) from the poll Shipman and Kay commissioned is that fathers seem to be better at recognizing a lack of confidence in their daughters than mothers: They were found to be 26% more likely to accurately estimate their child's confidence than moms were.\n\nHow could that be? Aren't mothers supposed to be the more intuitive parents? But as Shipman did her research, she found that mothers perhaps don't see their daughters' behavior as unusual.\n\n\"Perfectionism or worry about this or that, or sort of reticence to raise your hand, that's recognizable to us,\" Shipman said. \"Even if instinctively we know it's wrong, it doesn't seem odd, because we've probably experienced it. We may still do it, whereas I think fathers, who do have incredibly high expectations for their daughters, would be (saying) 'What is going on with my 9-year-old? Why was she this way a year ago, and now she's thinking she can't do anything?' They find it genuinely strange.\"\n\nThe takeaway is how influential role modeling can be for our kids. Let them see us, especially mothers, dealing with failure and struggle and taking risks.\n\n\"If we're going on, 'I'm so worried about this. I have to get it right,' it doesn't help them,\" Shipman said. She's tried to take this advice even more with her teenage daughter and \"lift the veil a little bit.\"\n\nWhen she's upset about something, for instance, such as having to rewrite a few chapters for a book, she lets her daughter see how she's feeling and then raises the question whether she's overreacting and figures out how she's going to deal with it -- all in front of her daughter.\n\n5. Remind her she doesn't have a problem.\n\nWith all the talk about girls and confidence, it's important to make it clear to our girls that it's not like they have a problem that needs to be fixed, Shipman said. Girls are the way they are for a host of reasons, including nature (brain biology) and nurture (society's different expectations for girls and boys.) They also often have a higher level of emotional intelligence.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"It's not like we want to churn out a bunch of girls who operate like boys,\" Shipman said. \"I think it would be wonderful for young women to understand much earlier on, essentially, the world doesn't operate like school.\"\n\nHelping girls understand at young ages what skills will be important later in life is key, including the ability to advocate for themselves and not worry about being people pleasers, Shipman said.\n\n\"Girls, even when they speak up in class or whatever it is, they want to please people, so I feel like the next hurdle is for girls to understand that they will not always please people. People won't always like them,\" Shipman said. \"And when they speak up, some people will like what they say, and others won't, and how do they develop that armor so that they say 'but that's OK, because I'm me.' \"",

    "text": "(CNN) A few years ago, when my girls were in the second and third grades, they raved about the dance breaks they would occasionally have during the school day.\n\nTheir teachers would put on a video, which encouraged the kids to get up and dance, and then they'd get back to work.\n\n\"What a brilliant idea,\" I remember thinking at the time.\n\nMy kids' teachers were certainly not alone. More teachers are incorporating some form of movement into the school day, especially as the research is pretty clear: Physical activity in school leads to better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral issues, not to mention cutting down on stress and anxiety.\n\nGroups such as the National Association of Physical Literacy tout the importance of teaching kids to move while they're young so that they will make movement part of their lives when they grow up.\n\nIt all seems like a no-brainer, especially as research shows that childhood obesity seems to be getting worse . As former first lady Michelle Obama advocated, let's get our kids to move.\n\nThe challenge, though, is persuading school administrations to consistently make time for physical activity when they are pressed to meet stringent academic requirements and find the money to pay for some of the training.\n\nResearch: Physical activity benefits students\n\nJust as our schools teach math literacy and reading literacy, they can teach physical literacy, teaching children the basics of movement so that they can stay active for life, said Susan Kamin, chief wellness officer for the National Association of Physical Literacy.\n\nThe for-profit association provides in-person and online training to teachers and communities and provides \"BrainErgizer\" videos, five-minute movement videos developed in conjunction with the University of Connecticut based on research on what stimulates the brain.\n\nDr. John Ratey , an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says activity breaks during the school day create better learners because of the impact of movement on the brain.\n\n\"When you move, you stimulate all the nerve cells that we use to think with, and when you stimulate those nerve cells, it gets them ready to do stuff,\" said Ratey, an expert in neuropsychiatry and author of \"Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain\" who has spent the past 30 years focusing on the \"attention systems\" of the brain.\n\n\"When you exercise, you turn on the attention systems, so that means you're (paying) better attention, you're able to deal with more frustration, you're able to stay with it longer,\" he said. \"You're able to manipulate information by turning ... on the front part of our brain to make it work better, and that's really key and important in terms of taking in information as well as performing with it.\"\n\nA recent study, a review of 26 previous studies looking at the impact of physical activity on academic performance, found that kids who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Pediatrics , involved more than 10,000 children between the ages of 4 and 13. It found that physical activity, especially physical education, improves behavior in classrooms and is a boost to academic achievement, especially math-related skills and reading.\n\n\"The research shows that it leads to better cognitive function for kids so they're going to have better results, academically,\" Kamin said. \"It's also going to help with behavioral issues in the classroom, because if kids are able to move, they're not going to have so much excess energy. They're going to be able to focus, and it's going to solve a lot of the sort of interpersonal issues that come up with kids as well, because they're going to have an opportunity to get that energy out.\"\n\nBreakthrough Magnet School, South, a pre-K through eighth-grade school in Hartford, Connecticut, is in its third year working with the National Association of Physical Literacy. The school had valued movement and mindfulness before, but since the partnership, the school has received additional training and is making physical literacy a key part of the classroom experience, Principal Julie Goldstein said.\n\n\"I think it really validates a lot of what teachers know: that students need movement, they need planned opportunities for movement and that it can be done in a pretty short, simple way throughout the day and that the benefits of it outweigh the little bit of planning that is necessary in the beginning to kind of get that structured,\" Goldstein said.\n\nHer third- and fourth-graders who are actively engaged in physical literacy are the highest-scoring students in math and literacy within the district, she said. Beyond the benefits academically, there are benefits outside the classroom. For this school year, not one student from this group has been referred to her office for a conversation with the principal. Before they started doing physical literacy, she might have had one or two office referrals every month, she said.\n\n\"This particular grade level is at the highest risk for misunderstandings, disagreements and even injuries at recess time, and we've had none, so the impact that it is has goes far beyond just the academic and the behaviors in the classroom,\" she said. \"Even during the unstructured times, they're better able to manage themselves, to play independently and to do that in a way so that the recess time actually serves them the way it's intended to, which is to give them time to play and have fun.\"\n\nUsing screens to get kids moving\n\nFour out of five elementary schools in the United States are using videos from the education company GoNoodle to promote physical activity in the classroom, the company says.\n\nThe concept is simple: Today's kids have grown up with screens, so GoNoodle tries to use entertaining videos, often about two minutes in length, that will get kids to move around and then either get back to their schoolwork or go off and play with friends.\n\nKC Estenson is the chief executive officer of GoNoodle, a for-profit company that makes money through relationships with partners who believe in the company's mission. (The videos are free for schools and parents, although teachers can pay for GoNoodle+, which for $10 a month gives them access to additional videos, games and classroom resources.)\n\nEstenson -- who is the former head of CNN Digital -- is a father of three who, like most parents, has struggled with how much time his kids, ages 8, 12 and 14, spend on screens during the day.\n\n\"GoNoodle gets kids to move. It gets them to be active,\" Estenson said. \"The entire purpose of this is a whole new interaction form with the screen, which is active engagement versus passive engagement, and most television and most of what's happening with the technology now of all ages is passive, binge viewing, hours spent just watching the screen and doing nothing else.\"\n\nThe key, he said, is making entertaining content that children (the target group is ages 5 to 12, grades K-6) will enjoy so much that they'll want to get up and dance or do yoga or even some form of meditation and mindfulness.\n\n\"And so starting from the earliest age ... we're putting positive associations between the right things that are available to them on these screens and hopefully giving them an awesome alternative to the junk food that's out there,\" said Estenson.\n\n'It really validates ... what teachers know'\n\nActive Schools, which was founded as part of Obama's Let's Move initiative, is a national movement, partnering with nonprofits and for profits to try to make physical education and physical activity a bigger part of the school day.\n\nThe goal is at least 60 minutes of activity per day, which is crucial especially since many kids don't get the play time children used to get outside of school decades ago. There are a variety of reasons why, including the widespread use of digital devices and a lack of access to and time for free play.\n\n\"One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from schools in the field is, 'we are very busy places. We appreciate what everyone offers, but it's overwhelming. Can you make it easier for us to know what's available?' \" said Charlene Burgeson, executive director of Active Schools.\n\nStreamlining to make it less cumbersome for schools to learn what resources are available and what programs they can bring to their school is one challenge. The others are money, time and philosophy.\n\nSchools can't always find the funding to pay for formal training, videos and other programs that get kids moving. There is also the pressure of the clock and having enough time to work physical activity in when trying to meet the required academic standards and complete the curriculum.\n\n\"I know lots of teachers who say, 'Yeah, I wish I had more time to do this,' \" the National Association of Physical Literacy's Kamin said. Even in schools that can find the time, there is still some opposition because it's a departure from the way things used to be, she said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"It's a big change for some of the teachers. They're not sure that they want to make that leap. It's sort of 'if it's not broke, why fix it?' Yet the schools that have made the leap see tremendous results. So how do you move the needle?\"",

    "text": "(CNN) We are all familiar with the negative images of girls and women in movies and other media -- and how ubiquitous they are.\n\nFrom the physical portrayal of women as ultra-thin, super sexy and scantily clad to the sexualized roles they often play, it's enough to make you wish you could put your daughters in a bubble to shield them.\n\nOf course, you can't. Even that \"Prince Charming\" narrative, in which their lives are not complete until they meet the right guy and that guy decides to love them in return, is everywhere.\n\nBut what about the positive role models our girls are seeing? Certainly, the #MeToo movement has called attention to the need to create more substantial roles for women of all ages on the big and small screens and to get more women behind the scenes in director and screenwriting roles.\n\nEven before the past six months when women's voices have been heard in ways they haven't been before, there were signs -- exciting signs -- of shifting portrayals of young women, even in children's programming.\n\nResearch shows that kids develop stereotypes at early ages. A Common Sense Media analysis of more than 150 articles, interviews and books and other research found that kids between the ages of 7 and 10 start to attribute certain qualities to women and men, such as that women are emotional and men are aggressive.\n\nLet me say that one more time. Between 7 and 10.\n\nHelping young girls and boys during these ages see realistic portraits of girls and boys can have enormous benefits, which brings me to \"Andi Mack,\" Disney Channel's No. 1 show in video on demand. The show just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third.\n\nSofia Wylie, left, and Peyton Elizabeth Lee of \"Andi Mack\" on Disney Channel.\n\nThink about the storyline, which is uncharted territory for mainstream children's programming: The main character, Andi, learns that the person she thought was her older sister for 13 years is actually her mother and that the two people she thought were her parents are actually her grandparents. Andi grapples with these life-changing circumstances with the support of her two best friends: the gender-stereotype-bashing Buffy, who believes she is as strong -- or stronger -- than any of the boys, and Cyrus, who has only recently shared with his friends that he is gay.\n\nMy girls, ages 10 and 11, and I watch the show -- together -- every Friday night. We recently had a chance to sit down with the show's creator and three of its stars.\n\n'A girl can do anything a boy can do'\n\nTerrI Minksy, the creator and executive producer of \"Andi Mack,\" wanted to create a show that mothers could watch with their daughters. She said she didn't create the characters with female empowerment in mind but very much was focused on the point of view of the girl, because girlhood is when girls begin to get a sense of their own power or lack thereof.\n\n\"There's always this 'you can grow up to be whatever you want,' but we haven't seen a female president in the United States. We don't see female faces when you're looking at anything where decisions are being made,\" said Minsky, who made the pilot with a predominantly female team.\n\n\"I just feel like it has to start with the kids as represented in the shows as having the power over their world, and hopefully that translates to people watching it without specifically calling it female power.\"\n\nSofia Wylie plays Buffy, who tries out for and makes the boys' basketball team (she also ends up tutoring the captain of the team). Sofia, 14, believes that her character can serve as an empowering role model to girls who watch.\n\n\"I would definitely say Buffy sends a message that a girl can do anything a boy can do and there's really no difference,\" said Sofia, also an accomplished dancer who has performed on stage with Justin Bieber and on \"America's Got Talent.\"\n\nSofia Wylie with her military mom on the show \"Andi Mack.\"\n\n\"So many people say, 'Oh, yeah, boys are just like stronger,' and when a boy says that, I'm going to contain myself now,\" she says to laughter as she indicates how frustrated that statement makes her feel. \"It's not true. If a woman wants to put their mind to something, they can be just as intelligent and just as strong physically and mentally in every way. They can be even better than a man.\"\n\nEven today, in 2018, a woman who is competitive -- especially in the workplace -- may be viewed differently than a man. A man may be considered assertive, a woman aggressive. Sofia says her character tackles that double standard as well.\n\n\"People think if you're competitive, that means you're mean,\" she said. \"No, she's competitive for a separate reason, because she's been told that she has to be strong.\" In one episode, we learn that Buffy feels she needs to always be strong to help her cope when her mom, who is in the military, is away during months-long deployments.\n\nA story line with #MeToo resonance\n\nOne of the recurring storylines that also tackles gender stereotypes head-on is Andi's crush on the handsome, athletic and very popular Jonah Beck. During season one and the first half of season two, Andi is basically obsessed with Jonah. At some point, it appears they may actually be boyfriend and girlfriend in the way 13-year-olds innocently begin relationships. She makes him a bracelet. She beams when she sees him. But he never seems to truly understand Andi and never does for Andi all the things she does for him.\n\nAnd then, Andi has had enough. With the support of her friends Buffy and Cyrus and her mom, Bex, she finally decides to tell Jonah that she has been obsessed with him and that she can no longer continue doing what she has been doing. It is the moment when, I would argue, many women watching (and many who have experienced #MeToo moments) ask themselves, \"Why didn't I say that when I was in a similar situation?\"\n\n\" allowfullscreen>\n\nLilan Bowden, who plays Bex, Andi's independent and individualistic mother, says she wishes she had \"Andi Mack\" when she was a girl. Instead, the shows she watched all repeated the same story line: The girl has a crush on the boy, the boy finally says he likes her back, and they get together.\n\n\"That was the message that I felt like I received over and over again: Just do the nice thing. If you're nice and you keep being nice and you don't stop being nice, eventually, you'll get what you want,\" Bowden said. \"And to have that character to say, 'I was nice, and you didn't appreciate it because you're not nice enough back to me' was huge.\"\n\nLilan Bowden, right, plays Andi's mother on the show \"Andi Mack.\"\n\nMinsky said the episode was written more as a natural progression of Andi's character and less in response to the #MeToo movement.\n\nWhen Andi expresses herself to Jonah, she's the one who is in charge for the first time, said Minsky, who also created \"Lizzie McGuire,\" a live-action and animated series that was also a Disney Channel hit.\n\n\"It's always the girl giving and embarrassing herself and putting herself out there and taking chances, and the boy's sitting back, and you don't know how he feels ... and then she finally expresses herself, and he's like 'Oh, wow, I really enjoy that you're obsessed with me,' and I kind of feel, 'yeah, I bet you did.' \" (In another sign of the show's relatable nature, it tackles anxiety when Jonah has a panic attack after Andi tells him she is moving on.)\n\nPeyton Elizabeth Lee, who plays Andi, said she, Sofia and Bowden cheered when they read that episode because it was a sign that Andi was \"finally finding her voice.\"\n\n\"Because she's just been so caught up in 'Jonah's cute, and he's fun, and he has so many friends, and he's popular, and he's athletic and whatever,' but when it really comes down to it, he wasn't giving her enough credit for everything she was doing for him,\" said Peyton, 13, who has appeared on ABC's \"Scandal\" and \"Shameless\" on Showtime.\n\n\"I think she was realizing that she's worth more, so it was a really exciting thing ... where she's saying 'I was obsessed with you,' and it's Andi realizing that she doesn't need him to feel complete.\"\n\nGender equality in media? Long way to go\n\nThere is no question that we need to see more realistic and authentic female characters on television and in film.\n\nResearch commissioned by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in the Media in 2014 shows how far we need to go. It found that the percentage of female characters in the work force in TV and film was less than 25%, when women make up just about half of the actual work force.\n\nFictional male judges and lawyers outnumbered female characters in those same roles 13 to 1; the breakdown of men to women was 7.6 to 1 when it came to characters in computer science and engineering.\n\nWe know that when you see it, you can be it. In a survey of 1,000 women in the United States and the United Kingdom, conducted by the Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson and unveiled in 2017, 71% of respondents in the US and 63% in the UK said that if we saw more corporate leader characters who were women, it would make it easier for women to become leaders in the corporate sector.\n\nSixty-four percent of respondents in the US and the UK said that seeing more female characters as politicians would make it easier for women to succeed in politics.\n\nBowden, who also regularly performs improv and sketch comedy, hopes shows like \"Andi Mack\" are a marker for what is to come.\n\nWhen she got to Hollywood and was auditioning, there was a very limited selection of roles for women, she said. \"It's almost like a paying of dues where ... you're pretty much just the eye candy,\" she said. \"I didn't want to be a model. I wanted to be an actor, but there's so many roles that are written for women where they just kind of pigeonhole you into being a model.\n\n\"This show is all these dynamic female characters that aren't relying on beauty at all, and that's not an experience I felt like I had when I was first auditioning,\" she said.\n\nWith surveys showing that girl confidence dips around puberty , having strong female early-teenage role models who speak truthfully and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe can only be a positive.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"I think you can take so many things away (from the show) but just being confident in yourself,\" Sofia told my daughters. \"I think that's the best thing about all of our characters is, we're all ourselves.\"\n\nAdded Peyton, \"A lot of shows showcase if you're just nicer, it all works out. If you're nice, you get friends. You have a boyfriend, but it's just not like that, and you have to find that balance of being nice, but being careful. ... You have to figure out which way you want to go.\"",

    "text": "(CNN) Sexting among teens and younger children has increased over the past decade and poses a growing challenge for educators and parents, according to a new study .\n\nOne in four young people said they'd received sexts, and one in seven reported sending them, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The research included data from 39 separate research projects conducted between January 1990 and June 2016, with a total of 110,380 participants, all of whom were under 18 -- with some as young as 11.\n\nThe researchers focused on data since 2008 and found an increase in sexting among young people.\n\nThe increased number of young people involved in sending or receiving sexually explicit photographs or messages has corresponded with rapidly expanding access to cell phones.\n\nWith that trend in mind, the study's authors suggest that \"age specific information on sexting and its potential consequences should regularly be provided as a component of sex education.\"\n\nWhy sext?\n\nThe researchers found that younger people engage in sexting in large part as a way to begin exploring attraction to other people.\n\n\"As teens get older, we are going to see increasing numbers ... who sext. Just as we see with actual sexual behavior,\" said study co-author Jeff Temple, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\n\"It's not terribly surprising considering as teens age, their interest in sexuality is heightened. They are trying to figure out who they are.\"\n\nKami Kosenko, a communications professor at North Carolina State University, agreed: \"As individuals become more comfortable talking about sex and interact with more potential sexual partners, we would expect to see them engage in more sexual communication, of which sexting is a part.\" Kosenko was not directly involved in the study.\n\nTeens sometimes 'assume safety'\n\nThe study predicts a similar upward trend in sexting among younger teens and preteens. Coupled with a lack of awareness of the risks involved, especially among younger children, that is a cause for concern, the researchers said.\n\nPreteens can be particularly vulnerable to the pitfalls of sexting. Relationships among tweens (children 10 to 12) are often short-lived, and that makes individuals more vulnerable to having sexts forwarded without consent or being subject to sextortion: the use of nude images and or videos as a form of threat or blackmail.\n\n\"As tweens and kid smartphone ownership gets younger and younger, we are going to see an increase in the number of teens who are sexting,\" Temple said.\n\nOn average, children in the study were 10.3 years old when they got their first smartphones.\n\nDanger also arises from messaging apps that give the impression that videos and images shared or stored are private, although this may not be the case.\n\n\"Teens can sometimes assume safety or security is embedded in these apps when it's not,\" said study co-author Sheri Madigan, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Calgary.\n\n\"Kids don't really have a clear understanding of cause and effect,\" Madigan said. \"When they send a picture, they may not recognize they cant get it back or that it is really up to the recipient to decide how they are going to treat that picture.\"\n\nKosenko said that \"with youth acquiring cell phones at younger and younger ages, we should be concerned about their digital and physical safety.\"\n\nPart of the problem lies in the children's brains, Madigan said. \"Younger teens who have less developed frontal lobes are less able to think through things than older teens. They are likely more vulnerable to being coerced into sexting or to participate in nonconsensual sexting.\"\n\nThere is little or no literature on tweens and sexting, according to Madigan, who suggests that it is important to do further research on the topic.\n\nNonconsensual sexting\n\nAccording to the study, 12.5% of young people -- or one out of every eight -- report that they have been forwarded a sext without consent from the sender and/or the receiver.\n\n\"That is why this concept of digital safety and security is so important: because we know that this is happening. We know that sexts are being forwarded without consent, so if parents are having conversations with their teens about sexting, they can talk about those potential risks,\" Madigan said.\n\nNonconsensual sexting can take a toll on a teen's health.\n\n\"If we look at things like sexual behavior with teens, if it's consensual and both teens wanted it and are OK with it, you are not going to see the negative psychological health. If it was nonconsensual or coerced, that is where you see the negative mental health problems, and we see the same thing with sexting,\" Temple said.\n\nAccording to the study, further research needs to be conducted on nonconsensual sexting \"to appropriately target and inform intervention, education, and policy efforts.\"\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nJAMA Pediatrics defines sexting as \"the sending or receiving of nude or seminude images or sexually explicit text messages.\" This can happen voluntarily in a relationship or when a teenager is asked to \"prove\" how much they like someone. It can also happen without consent.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe biggest concern, according to the journal, is the possibility of photos or messages being spread to other people. Sexting can cause severe emotional distress, which is why it is important to talk with children about it. The researchers suggest:\n\nStart the discussion early with your kids using broad questions such as \"have you heard of sexting?\" By understanding what your child already knows, you can then frame your conversation.\n\nUse examples appropriate for your child's age. Be specific about the possible consequences of sexting. \"Parents should be proactive and not reactive,\" Madigan said.\n\nRemind your teenager of their own worth. Let them know that being pressured is not OK and that sexting is not a way to \"prove\" their love. \"If you have the conversation early and often, when problems arise, then kids know they can go to their parents and talk to them,\" Madigan said.\n\nBeing open and withholding judgment are keys to a successful interaction with a young person about sexting, Kosenko said.\n\n\"This means that demonizing sexting won't work. Also, don't assume that you are the expert on the subject or the one who should lead the discussion,\" she said.\n\n\"You might be tempted to tell your children to ask you if they have questions, but consider what can be gained by letting your children tell you what they know and think about sexting.\"",

    "text": "When asked to describe a typical child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), most people would describe a young boy who climbs on things, is impatient and does not do what he is told.\n\nFew people would describe a bubbly young girl with lots of friends, who works hard to get good grades.\n\nIt may be, however, that the girl does experience ADHD symptoms that interfere with her daily life -- and that these symptoms are overlooked by the adults around her.\n\nUndiagnosed ADHD has long-term consequences including an increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviours -- such as unprotected sex and substance use -- as well as academic underachievement and low self-esteem . Perhaps most alarmingly, girls who struggle with ADHD for a long period of time can suffer from mental health problems\n\nAs a psychologist in clinical practice, I used to see many older girls and adult women with ADHD who had already been prescribed medication to treat anxiety and depression.

This suggests girls go unnoticed when they are younger.\n\nAs a disorder traditionally seen as affecting males, and with males referred more often for a diagnosis, research to assess ADHD has been based on samples largely consisting of boys. It has been argued that the rating scales developed to assess ADHD have been based on the behaviours observed in the mainly male research samples.\n\nADHD can look different in girls than boys. A boy who is hyperactive might have trouble sitting in his seat in the classroom -- so he sits with one knee on the seat and one foot on the floor. It is likely, given his constant shifting and unequal balance on the seat, that the back legs of the chair will eventually lift up and the chair pitch forward causing the boy to fall to the floor.\n\nIn contrast, a hyperactive girl may be out of her seat but have taken on the role of classroom helper, wandering around to different desks. A teacher completing a rating scale might rate the boy higher on hyperactive questions than the girl because the second example is not seen as disruptive. Thus, girls do not score as high as boys on these scales and are underrepresented because they do not meet criteria for a diagnosis.\n\nNot only do symptoms of ADHD look different in boys but boys also have a tendency to be more hyperactive and impulsive than girls. Because hyperactive and impulsive behaviours are more disruptive in the classroom, teachers are more likely to notice boys as a problem and refer them for attention challenges.\n\nLastly, symptoms of ADHD in girls are sometimes masked because they work hard to meet adult expectations. Without meaning to, adults have different expectations of girls than boys. Adults expect girls to be tidy and organized, achieve good grades and to be easygoing. In turn, girls are more likely to want to obey social norms and not cause trouble. They will work extra hard to achieve success by staying up late to finish homework or tidying their rooms when asked.\n\nSometimes, when adults encounter girls who have difficulty meeting their expectations but the girls are agreeable, they excuse the behaviours by describing the girls as \"ditzy,\" \"dramatic\" or \"artsy.\"\n\nSigns that your daughter might have ADHD\n\nThere are many symptoms of ADHD shared by both boys and girls. The following are examples of how they can manifest in girls:\n\nHomework takes longer than it should. She forgets about it or is distracted by surfing the internet or texting her friends and ends up staying up late the night before an assignment is due to finish it.\n\nShe is an inefficient student. While she appears to study for tests, her performance does not seem to match the time spent studying.\n\nShe has weak reading comprehension. She can get facts from a text but does not make links between the ideas she reads. She misses details in instructions on assignments and tests.\n\nShe struggles with friendships because she does not read social cues or follow conversations. Peers start to reject and isolate her or make fun of her.\n\nShe forgets things she needs (e.g. dance shoes or soccer cleats). This is a classic sign but agreeable girls with ADHD will often have friends or adults who compensate for them (for example sharing a pen because she doesn't have one).\n\nShe misplaces her things regularly (for example her phone, keys or bank card).\n\nShe talks, and talks and talks.\n\nShe does not run and climb about like boys but is the classroom helper and is social and chatty in class.\n\nShe has lots of friends because she is fun to be around but when she tries to organize activities she seems anxious and indecisive. Her friends help her make decisions, find her things and keep her organized.\n\nShe has great ideas and wants to start acting on them right away but does not finish projects or follow through.\n\nShe is chronically late or is not ready when she needs to be.\n\nShe channels hyperactivity by being involved in many extracurricular activities like swimming, school clubs and soccer.\n\nShe does not seem to learn from consequences.\n\nShe has wide swings in mood. One moment she is on top of the world and the next moment she is crushed because of a casual comment that is taken as harsh criticism.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you think your daughter might have ADHD, you should consult with a psychologist or pediatrician who is familiar with ADHD and can provide an in-depth assessment.",

    "text": "(CNN) As a mom of two daughters, I'm mindful of how girls today have more opportunity than ever. In fact, I tell my girls this all the time: They can be anything they want and shatter any glass ceiling, even the highest one, the presidency.\n\nBe confident and speak up, and you can achieve great things, we tell our girls. You can play any sport, join any after-school club, volunteer for any cause and get the grades. In fact, girls are regularly outperforming boys in school and enrolling in higher numbers in college.\n\nIt's a great time to be a girl -- or is it? Because behind all these possibilities is a troubling development: Girls' anxiety and depression are climbing and increasingly turning tragic.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2015, the suicide rate for girls between the ages of 15 and 19 doubled, reaching a 40-year high in 2015, according to new data from the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\"I think no one can dispute the wholesale kind of collapse of girls' wellness right now,\" said bestselling author Rachel Simmons, who has been working with and doing research on girls for the past two decades.\n\n\"It's really a crisis. I don't think I'm overstating it. Everywhere I go, I hear about levels of anxiety that are so crippling that it makes it hard for teachers to teach, and we can't not pay attention to this anymore.\"\n\nSimmons points to the findings of a 2015 freshman survey by UCLA of 150,000 full-time students at more than 200 colleges and universities.\n\nRachel Simmons is author of \"Enough As She Is.\"\n\nTwice as many girls as boys reported that they felt depressed frequently or occasionally, and twice as many girls as boys said they were \"overwhelmed with all they had to do\" -- a 25% jump in the number of girls in both categories in just over 15 years, according to Simmons.\n\nWhat's behind these concerning numbers? As Simmons writes in her new book, \"Enough As She Is: How to Help Girls Move Beyond Impossible Standards of Success to Live Healthy, Happy, and Fulfilling Lives,\" girls are growing up with outsize expectations of personal and professional success. The pressure to be great at everything is causing them to feel less confident, more fearful of failure and more critical of themselves, Simmons says.\n\nGirls' psychology and culture on 'collision course'\n\n\"There is a deep mismatch in terms of what the culture is telling girls and their most vulnerable parts of their psychology,\" said Simmons, who is also co-founder of the national nonprofit Girls Leadership.\n\nGirls are socialized at a very young age to rely heavily on feedback from others. They grow up paying more and more attention to what other people think of them and whether they are measuring up to those external expectations.\n\nIn today's society, that relentless concern about pleasing others is on what Simmons calls a collision course with two cultural changes: the ubiquitousness of social media, which is exacerbating the need to perform, and heightened expectations of what it means to be a successful girl today.\n\n\"We're now giving girls access to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). We're giving girls access to opportunities they've never had before. And we're not doing that and saying, 'Oh, you don't have to have a bikini body anymore. That's cool. You're good. You can look however you want to look,' \" Simmons said.\n\n\"No, we're saying 'keep your bikini body and become an engineering major and also have a totally lit Snapchat feed on a Saturday night,' and so that's exhausting, and I call that role overload and role conflict.\"\n\nSocial media alone becomes a \"virtual second shift\" for young girls, almost like a full-time job, as they spend more time on average on Instagram and Snapchat that boys do.\n\n\"Social media enables them to curate an exhausting range of identities -- jock, scholar, beauty queen, party girl, best friend, and on and on -- demanded by the new rules of girl success, crammed into a twenty-four-hour day,\" she writes in \"Enough As She Is.\"\n\nSimmons said she wishes she didn't have to write this book. In her bestseller \"The Curse of the Good Girl,\" published in 2009, she wrote about the need to teach girls how to take up space, find courage and be confident. But in her work with girls on college campuses and elementary, middle and high schools across the country, she started to see that the wellness piece was missing.\n\n\"Despite very high levels of achievement, girls were struggling with a sense of imposter syndrome, low lack of confidence, overthinking and an enduring belief that no matter how hard they tried, they were not enough of whatever it was,\" said Simmons, who has a young daughter of her own.\n\n\"Moreover, the terms of success that they had established for themselves were so kind of outsized and unrealistic and unhealthy that they were on this hamster wheel of trying to get something they were never going to get.\"\n\nSimmons said she has come to realize that in order to help girls become stronger and more confident, we have to attend to their emotional health. \"We never thought about girls' leadership as being integrated into their wellness, and ... that's the shift that's taking place, is that we need to start thinking about wellness in tandem with growing their confidence and growing their achievement.\"\n\nChanging how we teach girls\n\nTara Christie Kinsey , head of school at The Hewitt School, a girls' private school in New York City, and a former dean at Princeton University, said that what she and her colleagues in higher education have seen across college campuses for years are young girls with \"amazing ... paper resumes\" with all the right grades and SAT scores.\n\nIt \"looks amazing on paper, and yet the interior life of young women in particular was sorely lacking,\" said Kinsey, who has a daughter in the third grade and a son in the fifth grade.\n\nShe tells the story of meeting with a female college student when her then-5-year-old daughter burst through the office door, so excited to show her mom the contents of her kindergarten folder. When her daughter left, \"the young woman looked at me, and she said, 'I remember when I used to have that kind of confidence.' \"\n\nAs an educator and an advocate for girls and women, Kinsey said, she is focused on the gap between what we know girls need to thrive and be healthy and how we're teaching them every day, whether it's in the classroom or in the home.\n\n\"I think that better understanding that gap holds many of the keys to closing yet another gap, the success gap between how girls are faring in school -- where we know they're crushing it, and they're outperforming boys, and they're achieving at levels we've never seen before -- and how they're faring in life after school,\" Kinsey said. \"They're coming up against not only a structural glass ceiling but also a psychological glass ceiling that thwarts their self-actualization.\"\n\nKinsey was familiar with Simmons' books and incorporated her research into her work in higher education. When she moved to The Hewitt School, she wanted to bring Simmons' teachings and experience to students, faculty and parents in the community. In 2016, Simmons was named the inaugural Girls' Research Scholar in Residence at Hewitt.\n\nSimmons' work at Hewitt involves helping the girls and young women build their skills in the broad category of emotional intelligence, Kinsey said, with a focus on healthy risk-taking, conflict resolution, self-advocacy, managing friendships, and the giving and receiving of feedback.\n\nShe may be sprawled on the floor with an entire grade of middle-schoolers, tracing their bodies for an exercise on the difference between feelings you sometimes keep inside, such as jealousy, and feelings you express, such as anger. She might be sitting crisscross apple sauce with elementary school girls, talking about the difference between a real apology and a not-so-real apology.\n\nOr she may be standing on a chair and reciting a poem demonstrating how the pressure to be perfect really undermines the ability to give and receive authentic feedback.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do is fill in the blanks in terms of some of the skills that they don't have,\" Simmons said. \"So, sure, they're really good at doing their worksheets and the homework and sitting quietly in class discussions and taking exams, but when something goes off the rails, then we're working with them on, how do you cope? We're filling in the blanks, and I contend that if you fill in the blanks ... then we're going to see a better balance between all of this ... on-paper success and what's happening inside.\n\n\"But right now, things are out of whack. We got overdeveloped on paper and very underdeveloped in life and in terms of resilience (and) adaptability.\"\n\nIt is that fear of failure that can really be crippling for girls and young women today, which is why Simmons, who is also a leadership development specialist at Smith College, regularly concludes her orientation programs on college campuses with a graduation ceremony. The young women who attend will each receive a \"Certificate of Failure.\"\n\nThe mock diploma reads, \"Having honorably fulfilled all the requirements imposed by the overload of high school, you are hereby certified to screw up, bomb or otherwise fail\" during college \"and still be a totally worthy, utterly excellent human,\" Simmons writes in her book.\n\nThe girls laugh, she writes, but then they take those certificates back to their dorm rooms. \"Every girls needs a Certificate of Failure,\" she writes.\n\nHelping parents combat 'not-enoughness'\n\nAt Hewitt, Simmons also works with the teachers, helping them see the importance of trying to teach soft skills such as resilience and adaptability just like they are teaching anything else.\n\nInstead of giving feedback on written work, a teacher might do a one-on-one consultation with the student in which they focus on her goals and what she hopes to achieve in her next writing sample.\n\nIn math, teachers don't typically give girls grades on quizzes; they give written feedback so the girls can learn from their mistakes.\n\n\"You see how that's just completely transformative to girls and relationships, to their own achievement,\" Kinsey said. \"It's not about grades. It's about growth. It's about feedback. It's about failure. It's about honoring mistakes as a necessary part of the learning process.\"\n\nAs part of her work at Hewitt, Simmons also meets regularly with parents and tries to help them \"combat the sense of shame and 'not-enoughness' that so many parents have.\"\n\n\"This is an era in which parents are probably the least confident they're ever been in themselves,\" Simmons said. \"If we want our kids to feel like they are enough, the parents have to feel like they are enough.\"\n\nDuring coffee talks, she tries to help parents feel comfortable enough to share what they are most afraid of, such as concerns that their daughter doesn't have a ton of friends or isn't getting the best grades.\n\n\"We had a couple of faculty members who aren't parents who were sitting there going, 'Oh, my God. I had no idea that parents were that scared about their kids, and all I see is 'my daughter didn't get a good grade on the test,' and that anger is actually fear,'\" Kinsey said. \"That anger is fear, and what Rachel is doing in such a beautiful way is saying ''if you don't get in touch with that, you're not really modeling for girls what they need.' \"\n\nMuffy Flouret, who has a daughter in the seventh grade at Hewitt, said Simmons is helping students and parents understand what it means to fail and how to bounce back.\n\n\"She's on the edge of the research of how do we raise girls in the community, and it's invaluable, because parents who might not think twice about saying, 'Well, you didn't get the A. I'm not so happy about that,' might now think twice about that reaction,\" Flouret said.\n\nShe also said Simmons is helping the community understand the perils of trying to be the best at everything.\n\n\"To create this sort of pressure that you have to be the top of the soccer team and you have to be top of the debate team, it's not sustainable, and it's not realistic,\" she said. \"Where does that leave you as an adult? You have to be able to bounce back and react to things.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nJo-Anne Williams, co-chairwoman of the Hewitt Parents' Association, who has a daughter in the seventh grade at the school, attends nearly every one of Simmons' events with parents.\n\n\"It really causes you to take a step back and say, 'What am I really doing? Am I just trying to create a cookie cutter of myself, or (what) I want her to be?' \" Williams said. \"I worked in finance. I was always strong in certain subjects that she doesn't happen to like all that much. Am I pressuring her too much on math because that's not her thing? She's a dancer. She's a great writer. She's other things.\"\n\nWilliams said her daughter recently told her mother that she chews her fingernails because she's a perfectionist.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, I used to chew my fingernails when I was a kid,' and I said, 'I stopped doing it. And I also used to be a perfectionist and I've stopped doing that, so there's hope for you.' \"",

    "text": "Go Ask Your Dad is parenting advice with a philosophical bent as one dad explores what we want out of life, for ourselves and our children, through useful paradigms and best practices. Share your insight at the CNN Parenting Facebook page.\n\n(CNN) Without meaning to, my wife and I conducted an A-B experiment while disciplining our two children. They are 4\u00bd years apart, and somewhere in that gap -- thanks to the suggestions of the progressive, mindful parenting books we regularly consume -- we did away with the popular refuge of nearly all parents (probably since the dawn of time): the \"timeout.\" As some Neanderthal dad probably yelled, \"Go to your part of the cave until you've calmed down!\"\n\nThe arguments for the timeout boil down to: 1. It's better than spanking. (True.) 2. Parents want a little time away from a child's aggravating behavior. (No doubt.)\n\nTimeouts have been popular for decades and are still recommended by some parenting experts. But it's time to add the timeout to the parental dust bin of history, along with yelling, hitting and missing school in order to help run the farm.\n\nHere is the fundamental failure of the timeout: It's tantamount to abandoning your kid when they need you most. If they're acting up, it may be to get your attention. If they are upset or angry, they want you to connect with them (even if they push you away). Your calm, listening presence or a long hug -- not isolation -- is what they need to reconnect to their rational brain.\n\nGo Ask Your Dad is parenting advice with a philosophical bent as one dad explores what we want out of life, for ourselves and our children, through useful paradigms and best practices. It considers old problems in new ways, and new problems that previous generations didn't face.\n\nThese moments just after upsetting behavior and anger -- yours and theirs -- can move a parent-child relationship closer or farther apart.\n\nNeed some solid social science to convince you? The National Institute of Mental Health conducted a study in 1982 (the timeout method hasn't changed since then) that found kids who had timeouts -- or \"love withdrawal,\" as the study's authors also called the method -- were more misbehaved , even when moms in the study talked to their kids after their timeout reflection.\n\nPremier parenting academic Alfie Kohn has written extensively about the negative effects on a child's moral and psychological development due to timeouts and other love-withdrawal techniques. He cites child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, who concluded that timeouts can cause \"deep feelings of anxiety.\"\n\nAnd if you're telling yourself a timeout is not a punishment but rather a much-needed break for reflection and self-calming, let me ask you: Does your child think it's a punishment? If so, then it is.\n\nDescribing timeouts in their book \"How to Talk so Kids Can Learn,\" Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish write, \"As an adult you can imagine how resentful and humiliated you would feel if someone forced you into isolation for something you said or did.\"\n\nWhat's the alternative?\n\nI bet most parents who use the timeout -- which seems to work in the short run (perhaps because it triggers a child's fear of abandonment , according to developmental psychologist Aletha Solter) -- do so because it's expedient. If we had an alternative that worked more effectively and just as swiftly, we'd gladly use it.\n\nThe answer is \"time-ins.\" That sounds too cute to be real advice, but maybe it's just catchy enough that you will remember it when you're driven to the point of anger and not thinking straight yourself. Fight the urge to push your troubled kid away and work to embrace them instead.\n\nWhen you remove the option of distance and solitude, you have no choice but to engage. That step, by the way, is often all it takes to stop the behavior. But you can also help them calm themselves; a few deep breaths is remarkably effective.\n\nAnd then you both can find a solution together as a team instead of in opposition. Listen fully and patiently to their version of the story. And talk about mitigating factors. Are they hungry, angry, lonely, tired, stressed or sick (a list that forms the handy acronym HALTSS)?\n\nSometimes there are no solutions. We all just need to be heard sometimes. After you understand where they're coming from, try reflecting their feelings back to them. \"You feel sad that the playdate has to end.\" \"That's so frustrating when a plan doesn't work out like we hoped.\"\n\nTime-ins demonstrate to them you care, even when times get tough. It conveys the message that their \"bad\" emotions (which are really just difficult, yet perfectly natural, ones) are as acceptable as their pleasant, happy emotions. Time-ins also teach kids to pay closer attention to their feelings and needs, and get better at finding solutions to their problems. These moments -- when, reflexively, a timeout seems the easiest route -- are great parenting opportunities to connect (aka love) and teach life skills.\n\nSometimes, especially with older kids, they may genuinely want you to go away. But stay close. Maybe refrain from talking. If you leave the room, check in after a bit.\n\nMy wife and I give ourselves timeouts on occasion when we need a break. But sending yourself away is not the same as abandoning them, especially if you explain your emotional state before you excuse yourself. You are modeling the fact that everyone needs to give themselves recovery breaks (whether it's 30 seconds or 30 minutes). Your kids may use it as a model for themselves.\n\nExperiment: Give up timeouts for a month\n\nI'm guessing you won't be convinced that time-ins are more effective than timeouts unless you give it a try. See what happens when you issue no timeouts for a month. It may be a mess at first, but I'm convinced you'll see some significant results within a month.\n\nJoin the conversation on CNN Parenting's Facebook page See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Parenting on Facebook.\n\nOur home experiment had similar results as the National Institute of Mental Health study. If timeouts were effective, our younger child (who never got one) would be a terror. And our older one would have acted out more when we ceased to deploy them. But neither happened. In fact, we doubled down and largely did away with punishments altogether. The net result has been less confrontation, more cohesion, more solutions.\n\nOur first daughter is 10 years old and has recently started the tween-age rite of passage of occasionally storming off to her room. Sometimes, she adds the slammed door as a kinetic exclamation mark. It's a timeout of a different of color -- one she imposes on herself. But my wife or I will check in after a few minutes and see whether she wants to talk. Sometimes, I need to apologize if I'm the one who her upset her. But if she still wants to be by herself, we respect that. She knows we're nearby, always ready for when she needs a time-in.",

    "text": "Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns, and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter.\n\n(CNN) After horrific events like shootings or attacks by terrorists, parents are faced with this dilemma: What do I tell my kids? How can I talk to them about something so senseless and indiscriminate? About something that we can't make sense of ourselves?\n\n\"It's important to explain to children the rarity of these events,\" said Dr. Gail Saltz, who has been in private practice as a psychiatrist for more than 20 years and serves as a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill-Cornell School of Medicine.\n\nSaltz, whose latest book is \"The Power of Different: The Link Between Disorder and Genius,\" said parents can comfort their children by telling them these attacks may seem more frequent due to the global nature of news and the repetition of images surrounding the events on social media.\n\nParents should also realize that increased anxiety after an event like this is normal, experts say, even if the attack happened in another country, because social media makes the world feel very small.\n\n\"Over time, however, in allowing questions and shared thoughts along with reassurances about efforts by your family and security to increase safety while living your lives, anxiety should diminish,\" said Saltz.\n\nParents should keep an eye out for \"dramatic changes\" in behavior such as the way their kids interact with family and friends, or if they experience a sudden drop in grades, said Kelly Ward Becker, chief executive officer of Family Lives on Foundation, which supports the emotional well-being of grieving children.\n\n\"It's important to keep the channels of communication open to keep a pulse on your child's reactions and feelings,\" she said. \"Acknowledge their emotions and legitimize whatever feelings they are experiencing, which may range from sadness, anger or apparent indifference.\"\n\n\"While a wish to reassure might be our first instinct, what is needed is primarily to listen,\" said Gold. \"More than finding the 'right' thing to say is to use our own comforting presence.\"\n\nAfter an attack, it's more important than ever for parents \"to remain in check in relation to their anxiety,\" said Ferrara, who has been in private practice for more than a decade.\n\n\"If adults show an excessive level of anxiety and vulnerability, that will certainly create higher anxiety in children,\" she said.\n\nFerrara, Gold, Saltz and other parenting experts offer a range of tips on how to reduce anxiety in children -- and stress that the age of children and their temperament really determines what -- and how much -- to share.\n\nLimiting media exposure is key\n\nIf possible, children younger than 5 do not need to be told about what happened or exposed to any of the media coverage, said Ferrara. \"Keeping to routine is the best way to reassure children about the safety of their immediate world,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED The mental cost of trauma Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The mental cost of trauma 01:19\n\nChildren ages 6 to 11 need just basic facts and minimal exposure to media coverage, she said, adding that there are definite lessons from what children saw in the media following the September 11, 2001, attacks. She points to studies that found that children who had repeated and prolonged exposure to media images had more difficulty with anxiety than kids with less exposure.\n\nIn a statement after the 2015 Paris attacks, the American Academy of Pediatrics urged parents to be careful with images that children see. \"As pediatricians, we know that violence can have lasting effects on children even if they are only learning about it through the media,\" the statement said. The organization offered more resources for parents on how to talk to children about mass tragedies.\n\n\"A child will store the event in memory based on the narrative you assign the event,\" Ferrara said. \"For this age range, stick to basic facts and turn off the TV.\"\n\nSaltz agrees, and said parents of young children should \"stick to basic broad-stroke facts\" and avoid any \"nitty gritty details that are disturbing.\"\n\nParents should then communicate to their children an openness and willingness to talk, answering their questions and listening to their feelings, she said.\n\n\"Make it clear you understand their feelings. In other words, don't blow them off or avoid their feelings. This can be hard when they're (being) upset makes you more upset,\" said Saltz, author of \"The Anatomy of a Secret Life.\" \"But expressing their feelings will help them to cope. Then be reassuring about all of the security at work protecting us, and how rare an event this really is.\"\n\nHow to reassure your child\n\nReassurance is one of the most important things parents can provide children during a time of tragedy, when they fear it could happen to them, said Dr. Glenn Saxe, chairman of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU's Langone Medical Center , in a previous interview.\n\n\"The first kind of thought and feeling is, 'Am I safe? Are people close to me safe? Will something happen? Will people I depend on protect me?' \" said Saxe, who is also director of the NYU Child Study Center.\n\n\"You want to be assuring to your child, you want to communicate that you're ... doing everything you can do to keep them safe,\" Saxe said. \"You also want to not give false assurances, too. And this is also depending on the age of the child. You have to be real about it as well.\"\n\nIt helps, too, for parents to acknowledge their own fears about how to keep children safe, even amid unpredictable violence, said Gold, who is also author of \"The Silenced Child: From Labels, Medications, and Quick-Fix Solutions to Listening, Growth and Lifelong Resilience.\" It might seem counterintuitive, but acknowledging uncertainty can help parents connect with their children, and lead to a stronger sense of safety and security.\n\nShe points to how people have taken to the streets after recent attacks expressing that they will not be afraid. \"When our children can sense that courage in us, they too will not be afraid. When we can manage our own anxieties, we are in a better position to listen to the responses of our children, which may differ according to their unique individual qualities.\"\n\nDr. Joe Taravella, supervisor of pediatric psychology at NYU Langone Medical Center's Rusk Rehabilitation, said parents should not be afraid to show their own emotions about tragic events. Children pick up on the \"emotional temperature that's in the home,\" even if we think we're hiding how we truly feel, he said.\n\n\"We are our children's role models, so we should be leading by example at all times and when we're sad,\" said Taravella. \"We talk about our sadness so we can talk about us being fearful and sad that this happened, but then, I always try and end on the positive to help them cope or deal with it, that we are a family and that we support each other as a family.\"\n\nParents should also be mindful of any changes in their children's behavior after learning about a tragedy, Taravella said.\n\n\"I would try and put their behaviors into words like saying, 'I see that you've been more cranky lately or more upset, I'm wondering if something's going on, if you feel upset about something,' \" he said, which might help them communicate what they are feeling.\n\nHelping teens open up\n\nFor teens, who will most likely have heard about violent events or attacks through social media or news coverage, it is best to start by asking what they know, Ferrara said. Parents should also not assume their children are processing the events or trauma surrounding the events the same way they are, she added.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Initially, it is possible they may not have much to say,\" she said, but they might revisit the topic when something connects to them personally.\n\n\"Events like this sometimes defy language, and a teen may struggle to discuss. However, remain open for these emerging adults. They need to know that they matter and that the world's complexity is in dire need of their taking the time to think about and understand what it means to be global citizens,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a shared responsibility that none of us, parent or young adult child, is able to avoid.\"",

Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .\n\n(CNN) Every January for the past 20 years, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question \"what is the meaning of life?\"\n\nIt's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- philosophically and practically in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we never stop to really think about the answer. Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous.\n\nThis simple exercise might even help you live longer. According to two separate studies published in 2014 -- one among 9,000 participants over age 65 and another among 6,000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives died later than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.\n\nThe connection to longevity could be causal (having purpose may help one cope with daily stress , as other research has shown), but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.\n\nThe reason I ask this question year after year is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time.\n\nGreat thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is \"to serve others and to do good,\" and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, \"The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity.\" And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, \"if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.\"\n\nScottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, \"The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit.\" And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to \"throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.\"\n\n\"Love\" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, \"The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.\"\n\nMy favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, \"The purpose of life is a life of purpose.\"\n\nSome have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. \"There is not one big cosmic meaning for all,\" Ana\u00efs Nin wrote in her diary. \"There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.\"\n\nI agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. \"Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded,\" wrote Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, well-known for his book \"The Little Prince.\"\n\nTaking a few moments to record your answer to the question \"what is the meaning of life?\" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life.\n\nAnd then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding.\n\nIn 1997, my answer was \"the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss,\" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make \"the world a better place.\" In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply \"Love.\" And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic \"continuation of one's DNA to the next generation.\" But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nAs a practical matter, if you want to do the annual \"Meaning\" exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.\n\nThe last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If \"love,\" is the answer, then love more. If it's \"find your bliss,\" then get searching for it.\n\nThis is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful, and longer, life.",

    "text": "This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .\n\n(CNN) Odds are, you are trying to break a bad habit or institute a good one right now. As a species, we are impressively committed to self-improvement, and most of us believe that habits are an effective means to that end.\n\nHabits -- actions performed with little conscious thought and often unwittingly triggered by external cues -- are powerful influences on behavior and can be our greatest allies for positive change. But because they are so difficult to break, habits are also frequent saboteurs of personal progress.\n\n\"Habit is a good servant but a bad master\" is how author Gretchen Rubin summed it up in her book \"Better Than Before: Mastering the Habit of Our Everyday Lives.\" Hers was one of three recent books I read back-to-back on the subject of habit formation; the others were Charles Duhigg's \"The Power of Habit\" and Jeremy Dean's \"Making Habits, Breaking Habits.\" Together, they helped me understand more deeply the importance of habit control, how to choose a habit to begin or end, and the mechanics of sticking with it.\n\nThe first thing to know, each book explained, is that a lot of our daily actions are so rote, they are automatic. \"All our life ... is but a mass of habits,\" philosopher and psychologist William James wrote, though a 2006 study put the amount of habitual daily action at 40% . Still, that's a lot of mindless behavior.\n\nIt's helpful that we don't need to think about how or when to drink coffee, brush our teeth or drive to work. If we did, we'd waste so much time rethinking or learning those tasks, we'd get little else done.\n\nThe whole trick is to get habits to work for you, not against you. Self-control is a limited resource, Dean explains, so a good habit means not having to exert effort every time you need to do the right thing.\n\nRoom to grow\n\nThe first thing to identify for yourself is the habit you want to work on, whether it's starting a new (good) one or ending an old (bad) one. That's a minor distinction, by the way. Eating healthier is eating less junk. Exercising more is being less sedentary. One is often the inverse of another.\n\nThis step requires some honest self-evaluation. What is not working in your life? What personality flaws are holding you back? Where is there room to do better?\n\nWe know what many of the most common areas of improvement are, at least when it comes to making resolutions. People want to lose weight, eat better, be more mindful, spend money more wisely, sleep better and improve relationships. By eliminating bad habits and starting new ones, you can succeed in most of these areas.\n\nOne helpful checklist frequently used for goal-setting is the acronym SMART, created by economic theorist Peter Drucker. Effective resolutions, research has shown, are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound.\n\nBefore finishing the first book (Dean's, which is the most prescriptive and research- and science-based), I decided on two habits to work on myself. The first was to be more present and mindful with my kids. The second was to stop seeking out and consuming free, non-nutritious food at work. One was a good habit to start, the other a bad habit to quit.\n\nRubin, who approaches the topic personally and looks for specific techniques that work for her, recommends starting a habit at the same time as a big turning point such as pregnancy, marriage, a medical diagnosis, a family death, an anniversary, a long trip or a new year.\n\nRepeal and replace your behavior\n\nThe consensus among these books is that the most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one. Dean's metaphor is to think of habits as well-worn rivers of action that flow out of the predictable path of your routine. Often, the most effective way to stop it flowing in harmful directions is not by damming it but by diverting it. For example, many people stop smoking by chewing gum.\n\nThe point is that bad habits die hard, and as with riding a bike, your brain never stops learning how to do them.\n\nSo it's easier to think about any habit formation, even new \"good\" ones, in terms of replacing unwanted behavior. That made sense for my snacking at work. I started buying healthy yet still delicious snacks to keep there: yogurt instead of morning doughnuts, dried papaya instead of chocolate, sweetened rice cakes instead of stale leftover doughnuts. A supply of healthy snack options kept me on a new course of action that largely followed the old eating habit pattern.\n\nTo be more mindful with my kids, I needed to avoid the opposite behaviors, such as checking my work phone or planning activities while with them so I could focus on their needs and thoughts.\n\nDuhigg explains that habit \"reversal therapy\" is a legitimate technique used for things like tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as predilections such as gambling, smoking and bed-wetting.\n\nIt's important to make a distinction between a bad habit and addiction, however, even if the behaviors seem to overlap. Addiction requires greater intervention than habit hacking.\n\nDean describes the hallmarks of addiction as not being in control and not being aware of time/energy spent on the behavior. People with addictions are preoccupied with soothing a craving and needing more and more to get the same effect, as well as suffering withdrawal without it. Unlike bad habits, addictions eat away at important activities such as relationships and work. They tend to be an escape from normal life and are often hidden from others.\n\nThe wonderful thing about triggers\n\nWe like to think we have free will in every situation, but many of our actions are predictably triggered by external situations. And if those events are part of your daily or weekly routine, our Pavlovian tendencies become ingrained. Pajamas are on: Time to floss and brush. Cup of coffee in hand: Time to dunk a doughnut. Beer finished: Let's have a cigarette. But triggers can also be feelings, such as stress or boredom.\n\nBeing aware of your triggers is the first step in learning how to keep them from sabotaging you and make them work for you instead. Is there a certain time of day or task when you crave a treat? What do you always do when you feel stress (go for a run or go for a drink)? What is your bedtime ritual to let your brain know it's time to sleep?\n\nYou can help create conditions to avoid triggers, but not fully. If the trigger is deeply ingrained, maybe going back years, it will sabotage you when your guard is down. For these situations, you need contingencies. Dean calls them \"If ... then ...\" plans. When trigger X happens, I won't do bad habit Y, as I usually do, but I will replace it with much healthier Z action.\n\nMy favorite example of effective trigger planning is Starbucks, a company that puts a higher premium on customer service than on the (habit-fueled) products it sells. Duhigg, who prefers Malcom Gladwell-esque case studies for his book, explains that the chain's baristas are well trained on what to do when something goes wrong, such as a messed-up order that angers a customer. Rather than improvise or consider options in those moments, they practice rapid responses -- such as apologizing and offering a replacement drink for free -- until it's second nature.\n\nYou likewise need to have a plan for when a strong, perhaps rare, trigger threatens your winning habit streak. Ordinarily, I can avoid eating cupcakes at work, but what's my plan when I've skipped lunch, it's late afternoon, I have some onerous task that would be made more enjoyable with a treat, and the cupcake is filled with peanut butter?\n\n66 is the magic number\n\nAccording to one study cited by Dean and Rubin, it takes 66 days of doing something to convert it to a habit. However, that number varies depending on the person and activity. For example, it took those participating in the study less than 20 days to habitualize drinking a glass of water every day, 60 days for eating fruit with lunch and more then 84 days to make 50 sit-ups a daily habit. Some habits could take a year to form. But 66 days is a good target.\n\nI avoided work snacking and improved my capacity for parental mindfulness for 66 days straight. Or rather, I diligently monitored these habits over 66 days, because another pillar of successful habit formation is tracking. Even something as subjective as \"be more present with my kids\" can be numerically self-scored every evening.\n\nAnd another pro tip of habit-making (or replacing) is accountability. Tell other people. Share on social media (unless social media is the habit you're changing). Ask your friends and family to support the effort. Getting others involved, or even just aware, makes it harder for you to give it up. And others' support can be inspiring and helpful.\n\nTreat yo'self: rewards\n\nUnlike tracking and accountability, incentives are a debatable strategy. Duhigg believes that they are central to the exercise, because habits are reward-based. Rubin concludes that external rewards take you away from internalizing the right motivation behind your new habit.\n\nFor me, rewards have been pivotal. Five years ago, I took off 25 pounds and have kept it off by establishing an elaborate reward system\n\nIf you do treat yourself for keeping a habit, make sure it's not self-defeating. You may not want to reward, say, avoiding doughnuts by indulging in a half-gallon of ice cream.\n\nAnd that's one to grow on\n\nAt the end of 66 days, I stopped tracking my new habits and found that they had largely stuck. When I came home from work, seeing the faces of my daughters was the trigger to remind me to give them my undivided focus. I rarely (instead of automatically) checked my phone for work updates, and I put off my personal agenda items until after bedtime. And I replaced workplace snacking with my private stash of more nutritious snacks: same trigger, but alternate behavior at much fewer calories.\n\nThe real test though, is time. More than six months have passed since my 66 days of daily tracking, and I'm still doing a solid job on mindful parenting. I have occasionally slipped on the work snacking, though. I wouldn't say I've failed at it, because I'm building up a new long-term habit muscle for healthy snacking, and I ate a lot less junk food than I would have without trying.\n\nRubin would call it \"stumbling,\" and we should accept that it happens in the habit game. Stumbling is not a reason to quit trying.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nYou may want to read one of the habit books, too. The three overlap and support each other, but my personal preference was for Rubin's, largely because I feel a kinship with her love of life-hacking, introspection and applied psychology.\n\nShe's the author of the bestselling \"The Happiness Project\" and wrote this new book, she explained, after concluding that habits were the best means to actually achieve happiness.\n\nBut I'll give the last word to the wise Ben Franklin, whose advice would make all these books unnecessary. \" 'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them,\" he wrote.",

The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .\n\n(CNN) Have you ever asked yourself why you wanted (or want) to have children?\n\nThose who wrestled with the decision or struggled to conceive a child have probably thought about it a good deal. And some have always known the answer, maybe since they were kids themselves.\n\nBut for many parents and would-be parents, the question may seem odd or elementary -- which makes it a great question to tackle.\n\nOne answer is that we, as a species, harbor an evolutionary drive to propagate. Our small part -- at its most basic, perhaps unconscious and even (by design) pleasurable level -- is to carry on our DNA to the next generation. If enough of us do that (and we avoid destroying the planet), human beings will thrive.\n\nAnother answer is simply social and cultural norms. The majority of the people you know, and most of those you don't, are doing it. This is why people who don't have kids often have an answer to \"Why?\" at the ready: because everyone asks them. Rarely, though, are parents asked what motivated them to have kids. There's little need to explain behavior that is typical and expected.\n\nBut even with evolutionary hardwiring and societal peer pressure as part of the equation, that usually doesn't fully explain the unique, individual drives that lead people to want to make other people.\n\nWhatever your reason, it says something important about you and about the kind of parent you are or hope to be. I think it's worth exploring.\n\nYou are the parenting expert you've been looking for\n\nWhy did you decide to have children? Why do you want one, or a second or third? What is it about your personal desires, history, influences and beliefs that led to such a major life decision? Why spend so much time and money, and take on all that additional stress, anxiety and responsibility?\n\nKnowing why you got into this game can give you the insight needed to play it to the best of your ability. You are your own best guide to navigating the million and one parenting questions, conundrums and choices you will face from here on out.\n\nHistorically, people have had children out of economic necessity, to work the farm, for example. Conversely, children can be symbols of prosperity. They can be a reflection of yourself or a vessel for your own wishes and goals. Or parenting can be a noble act of sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nPete Seeger is credited with this sweet answer: \"We do it for the high wages ... kisses.\"\n\nWhen I asked friends and family this question, it was interesting to see how some knew their answers right away while others stared off in the distance with a puzzled look on their faces, as if they'd never pondered it before.\n\nHere's a taste:\n\nRe-create my own childhood joys\n\nGrow and share familial love\n\nMake myself a better person\n\nStart my own family after being on my own for a long time\n\nAdd to a greater sense of life's purpose\n\nFit in and meet society's expectations\n\nBecause kids are fun to hang out with and talk to\n\nHelp make the world a better place\n\nBe a better parent than I had\n\nA spiritual call to action\n\nRepay what I owe my parents\n\nGive in to a biological urge\n\nCultivate a strong relationship with my kids so they remain a part of my life after they move out\n\nMy wife had her answer at the ready: \"I wanted to feel the intense love a parent has for a child.\" It's a desire she's had since she was a young girl.\n\nAs I began to tell her my reason, I saw a nervous look on her face.\n\n\"I feel like we should have had this conversation before we had kids,\" she said, cutting me off. \"What if I don't think your answer is a good one?\"\n\n\"Too late,\" I said.\n\nMy reasoning lies in the high premium I put on experience: travel. Film. Reading. Writing. Storytelling. Humor. Food and drink (more drink than food). Spirituality. Nature.\n\nBeing a parent is a unique experience. I am aware of the missed adventures and career options I might have pursued were it not for my two daughters. But still, being their father comes out far ahead.\n\nI also hubristically thought I'd be very good at parenting. There's a part of me that wanted to improve upon my own upbringing. Since I was a kid, I'd been convinced I would be an amazing father.\n\nThat was, of course, before I became one. Parenting, it turns out, is humbling in the way it exposes your insecurities and personality flaws. I'm getting better, and I try to live up to that potential, but I routinely fall short -- which every parent can relate to.\n\nPut your answer to good use\n\n\"Mindful parenting\" is one of the most enlightened trends in the history of parenting techniques. It's about being present with your children but also better understanding your motivations and feelings while parenting. Getting in touch with your motivation for becoming a parent gives you a perspective too often lacking at difficult parenting moments.\n\nMy answer, about wanting these unique and varied parenting experiences, has helped me embrace a wider spectrum of them. It's easy to revel in a bear hug or a shared laugh, but I'm extending that love of experience for more challenging moments, such getting screamed at in the middle of a bath time. Staying present and connected to whatever is going on when I'm with my daughters gives them more of the attention they need from me and makes meaningful moments more frequent and poignant.\n\nYour own answer to the question is something of a parental compass needle too, pointing the way when you are unsure how to parent in a given situation.\n\nGet back to the roots of your parenting motivation. It could impact how you respond to frustrating moments, how you spend your weekends, what behavior you model and how you talk to your children about life.\n\nNew CNN Parenting column: Go Ask Your Dad\n\nThis column, The Wisdom Project , is getting a spinoff series called Go Ask Your Dad, about parenting wisdom. There is no shortage of parenting advice out there -- professional, familial, terrible -- but there is not enough that looks beyond the new trend or list of tips to get at what we want out of life for ourselves and our children.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nGo Ask Your Dad will explore useful paradigms and best parenting practices that will help you think of old problems in new ways or new problems previous generations didn't face. And for free, I'll throw in social science research, personal anecdotes and too many metaphors.\n\nWe all need guideposts through this (at times, uncharted) desert, so that we know we're on the right path.\n\nStart with the question of why you headed out on the path in the first place. The answer to why you became a parent will help you more clearly draw your map.",

Where are you on the curve?\n\n(CNN) Santa Claus is coming to town -- or so about 85% of young American children believe.\n\nIn interviews, 85% of 4-year-olds said that they believed in Santa, 65% of 6-year-olds said that they believed, and 25% of 8-year-olds said that they believed. Those numbers were published in a small study in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry in 1978.\n\nBut researchers say those percentages of young children who believe in jolly old Saint Nick seem to have remained steady over the years.\n\nThe Parent Curve offers a look at the norms and numbers around tough decisions parents face. Where are you on the curve?\n\nResearch in the Journal of Cognition and Development in 2011 shows that 83% of 5-year-olds think that Santa Claus is real, the study's lead author, Jacqueline Woolley, wrote in The Conversation last year.\n\n\"We have found in more recent studies that that number of 85% sounds about right,\" said Thalia Goldstein, assistant professor of applied developmental psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\n\"Children's belief in Santa starts when they're between 3 and 4 years old. It's very strong when they're between about 4 and 8,\" she said. \"Then, at 8 years old is when we start to see the drop-off in belief, when children start to understand the reality of Santa Claus.\"\n\nNearly three-quarters of Americans say they typically received Christmas Eve visits from Santa as children, and one in five adults says they are the parent or guardian of a child in their home who believes in Santa, according to a Pew Research Center study published in 2013.\n\nOutside the United States, how many children believe in Papa Noel? The percentage appears to be similar in some European countries.\n\nOf 161 parents in the United Kingdom, 92.5% thought Father Christmas was real for their children up to the age of 8, according to a research paper presented at the annual meeting of the European Early Childhood Education Research Association in Finland in 1999.\n\nIt turns out that the more live Santa Clauses children are exposed to, the more likely they are to believe that he is the \"real\" Santa, according to a study published last year in the journal Cognitive Development\n\nGoldstein co-authored the small study with Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe study involved 77 children, 2 to 10 years old, who were interviewed after visiting a man dressed up as Santa Claus at a children's science museum in Norwalk, Connecticut. The interviews were conducted over the course of one week, before Christmas.\n\nThe interviews revealed that 39.2% of the children believed that the man they visited was the same Santa who came down their chimneys. An additional 38.8% didn't believe that he was the same person but thought he also lived at the North Pole and could communicate with the real Santa, Goldstein said.\n\nThen, 13.8% said that the man was not Santa but that he shared characteristics with the real Santa, and 1.3% had a somewhat \"adult belief,\" Goldstein said, in which they said that the man was not Santa and did not live at the North Pole but could communicate with the real Santa.\n\nA limitation of the study was that older children who do not believe in Santa were excluded from the sample of participants since they \"may have been reluctant to accompany their parents to this event,\" the researchers wrote.\n\n\"Age didn't predict whether or not they thought that live Santa was the real guy, and then we also found that what the parents were telling the children -- the amount of Santa activities and Santa promotion that the parents were engaging with -- also didn't affect whether or not the children believed that he was the real-life Santa,\" Goldstein said.\n\n\"The only thing that affected their belief was how many other Santa Clauses they had interacted with that year,\" she said.\n\nOn the other hand, age and cognitive development seem to predict when kids start to lose their belief in Santa, said Andrew Shtulman, a cognitive developmental psychologist and associate professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's not a coincidence that children stop believing in Santa during the early elementary school years, because that's a time when they are developing more sophisticated notions of what is possible and what is not,\" said Shtulman, who has led separate research on children's belief in Santa Claus\n\nJUST WATCHED Mila Kunis' daughter 'too logical' for Santa Replay More Videos ...

    "text": "(CNN) It's a precious moment for families around the world when twilight falls, children yawn and bedtime routines engage.\n\nYet the places where children sleep, the time they lay down at night and even how they prepare for shut-eye vary across cultures.\n\nEven differences in children's bedrooms around the world can be striking, as inVenice-basedphotographer James Mollison's photo series \" Where Children Sleep ,\" which has been adapted into a book.\n\nThough it has been nearly seven years since the series was published, the photographs still spark conversation as they turn a lens to bedtime around the globe\n\nParenting Without Borders considers how parenting trends and methods differ -- or don't -- around the world.\n\nWhile photographing the series, \"I met many families who sleep together in one room or children who sleep in a space of convenience, rather than a place they can in any sense call their room,\" Mollison said.\n\n\"I came to appreciate just how privileged I was to have had my own bedroom to sleep in and grow,\" he said. \"I met children who had literally nothing except for a place to sleep and other children who couldn't move for all their toys.\"\n\nHere is a sampling of what bedtime looks like in households around the world.\n\nDrastic differences in babies' bedtimes\n\nWhile researching children's sleep across the globe, clinical psychologist Jodi Mindell was surprised to discover significant differences in bedtimes for infants and toddlers based on where they lived.\n\nShe described the differences as \"unbelievable.\"\n\n\"When I walked into doing this study, I really thought we would see 10- or 15-minute differences,\" said Mindell, a professor at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia and associate director of the Sleep Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nIt turned out, however, \"we're seeing these 2\u00bd-hour differences between some countries like Australia and New Zealand with other countries like Hong Kong and Korea,\" she said. \"Bedtimes ranged dramatically across cultures.\"\n\nMindell and her colleagues analyzed how the parents of 29,287 infants and toddlers, up to 3 years old, responded to questionnaires about their children's bedtimes. Those findings were published in the journal Sleep Medicine in 2010.\n\nThe parents were from China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. They completed the questionnaires between May and June 2006, September and December 2007 and April 2008.\n\nThe researchers found that the latest bedtimes were reported among parents in Hong Kong, who on average reported bedtimes about 10:17 p.m., whereas the earliest bedtimes were reported among parents in New Zealand: around 7:28 p.m., on average.\n\nThe study was sponsored by pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, and Mindell has served as a consultant for the company.\n\nBedtimes also appear to vary across European countries, said Sara Harkness, a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Culture, Health, and Human Development at the University of Connecticut.\n\nShe was not involved in the Sleep Medicine study but has conducted research on children's activities and bedtimes.\n\n\"We certainly did find in our research in Spain that early bedtimes were not common for young children. In fact, on one occasion, our Spanish colleague invited us to watch preschool children in a performance at a local festival starting about 11 p.m.,\" Harkness said.\n\n\"The most dramatic contrast we've seen to this pattern is in the Netherlands, where babies and young children are put to bed at around 6:30 or 7 and expected to sleep through the night in their own bed, often in their own room,\" she said.\n\nOn the other hand, \"in small-scale traditional preindustrial societies such as the Kipsigis people of Kenya, where we did research in the 1970s, babies were always in close proximity to caretakers, generally their mother or an older sibling, and they slept anywhere and any time,\" she said.\n\nAround the world, there are not only differences in when babies snooze but in what happens before they slumber.\n\nParents try it all to get babies to sleep\n\nIn the United States, it's common for parents to prepare their children for bedtime with a soothing bath followed by a lullaby or, for older kids, a book.\n\nYet around the world, bedtime routines involve a different approach, and in some places, they appear to be less common.\n\n\"One of the biggest similarities is that most families include in their child's bedtime routine, for 0-3, some type of feeding, whether it's breastfeeding or bottle-feeding or snacks, and that's consistent across all countries, but if we take that out, there's big differences in activities like bathing,\" Mindell said, citing her own research\n\nIn the US, \"60% of families have a bath as part of their bedtime routine. It's even higher in the United Kingdom at 81%. But somewhere like India, only 13%. In Indonesia, it's only 6%,\" she said. \"They typically bathe in the morning or at another time of the day.\"\n\nThere are also regional differences in which bedtime routines include prayers, Mindell added.\n\n\"In the Philippines, 29% of families -- basically one out of three families -- include prayers as part of their bedtime routine,\" she said. \"Whereas some place like Australia, only 6% did. In Indonesia, 30% include prayers as part of their bedtime routine.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Toddler's bedtime prayer caught on baby monitor Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toddler's bedtime prayer caught on baby monitor 01:52\n\nOnce the time comes to actually get some shut-eye, parents use different approaches to get their children to sleep.\n\nIn Korea, Harkness said, parents often sleep with their babies to help them drift into dreamland, but Dutch parents tend to leave their babies alone in their rooms, where the children must learn to put themselves to sleep.\n\n\"The Dutch parents in our studies strongly supported a cultural rule of the ' Three R's' of childrearing -- rust, regelmaat, en reinheid, or 'rest, regularity and cleanliness' -- which entailed establishing a firm routine featuring plenty of sleep on a regular schedule from an early age,\" Harkness said.\n\nWho bed-shares, and who doesn't\n\nSimilar differences emerge among bed-sharing practices.\n\n\"Co-sleeping is the usual practice in preindustrial societies around the world where there are no special beds for babies to sleep safely by themselves. Co-sleeping on mats on the floor is a cultural norm in Asia, where the family traditionally co-sleeps together in the same room. Mats are brought out at night, then stored during the day so the same room is both a living room and a sleeping room,\" Harkness said.\n\n\"We found more tolerance for co-sleeping for at least part of the night for babies and young children in European communities we studied, but this may have changed more recently following pediatric advice,\" she said.\n\nIn the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against sharing a bed with your infant and says \"there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed-sharing 'safe.' \"\n\n\"The US parents seem to receive more strict guidance, especially from pediatricians, about avoiding co-sleeping,\" Harkness said. \"This is part of a larger set of advice about sleeping arrangements, including not using padded 'bumpers' around cribs, having the baby sleep on its back and not using covers such as quilts or blankets for babies -- all for the same purpose of avoiding the danger of suffocation.\"\n\n'Bedtime routines are the perfect package'\n\nAll in all, bedtime routines can benefit a child's development , Mindell said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Bedtime routines are the perfect package for not only sleep, but for promoting positive child development,\" Mindell said.\n\n\"Children who have consistent bedtime routines not only sleep better, but it also promotes things like literacy, attachment, language, bonding and self-care -- all the things that we want children to have, whether or not they live in India or whether they live in the United States,\" she said.",

And I say, 'What for? You didn't need it before; why do you need it now?' \" said Zaske, author of the upcoming book \" Achtung Baby: An American Mom on the German Art of Raising Self-Reliant Children ,\" to publish in January.\n\n\"We intend to give Sophia a flip phone next year so that she can call us and make plans with friends after school more easily, but we will hold off on the smartphone until high school,\" she said.\n\nAs in most developed countries, Zaske said, many German children had access to smartphones or computers in their homes, but owning their own mobile device was not as common as it appears to be among children and teens in the United States.\n\nHere is a sampling of at what age children around the world are given their own cell phones.\n\n'Children across countries were sensitive to costs'\n\nAcross Europe, about 46% of children 9 to 16 own a smartphone, according to a study published in the journal New Media & Society in 2015.\n\nThe study surveyed about 3,500 children in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2014.\n\n\"Back in 2014, around 80% of children owned either a mobile phone or a smartphone; 46% owned a smartphone and 33% a mobile phone,\" said Giovanna Mascheroni, a senior lecturer at the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica of Milan in Italy and lead author of the study.\n\nYet, she added, there were differences across countries in how much children were allowed to use their smartphones in school and other places.\n\n\"Children in Italy and the UK were more likely to be restricted at school. They had no access to Wi-Fi and had to turn off their smartphones, whereas children in Denmark reported using the smartphone for class activities more frequently,\" Mascheroni said.\n\n\"Children in Portugal were more affected by the economic crisis, so they reported not having an internet plan any longer because it was too expensive,\" she said. \"In general, though, children across countries were sensitive to costs. They used Wi-Fi networks when possible and switched 3G or 4G off to save money and power.\"\n\nIn the United States, cell phone ownership seems to begin at a younger age.\n\nKids having their own service plans\n\nIn a Nielsen report released in February , about 45% of US children 10 to 12 had their own smartphone with a service plan, as opposed to just using Wi-Fi.\n\nWhen did kids get a service plan? About 22% did so around age 10, 15% at ages 9 or 11, and 16% around age 8, according to the report.\n\nJUST WATCHED Keeping tabs on your kids' screen time Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keeping tabs on your kids' screen time 03:14\n\nA separate report released last month by the nonprofit organization Common Sense Media found that 42% of US children 8 and younger now have their own tablet devices.\n\nThose numbers came as no shock to Douglas Gentile, a psychology professor at Iowa State University who was not involved in the new report but has studied the effects of media use on children.\n\n\"It's not surprising, because it's what we look around ourselves and can see. I can see it at the airport, for example. I can see it at restaurants, and I can even see it in my own home where my younger daughter watches almost no television, but she'll watch lots of TV shows on her phone,\" Gentile told CNN in October.\n\nOutside the US and Europe, children tend to own their first mobile phones when they are older.\n\nIn South Korea, about 72% of children owned a smartphone by ages 11 to 12, and they would spend up to 5.4 hours a day on them, according to a study published last year in the journal Computers in Human Behavior . In comparison, adults reported spending about 3.8 hours on their phones, according to the study.\n\n\"It seems that Korean children start to have their own mobile phone around second to third grade, and by the time they become fourth-graders, most of them have mobile phones,\" said Yoori Hwang, a researcher at Myongji University in Seoul and lead author of the study.\n\nAmong Taiwanese children, the numbers of those who used cell phones rose steadily from 45% of 11-year-olds to about 71% of 15-year-olds, according to a study published in the Journal of the Formosan Medical Association in 2015.\n\nA wide disparity across cultures\n\nIn Turkey, there was no consensus among parents regarding the best time for their kids to have mobile phones, according to a study published last year in the Interactive Journal of Medical Research . The study involved 333 participants.\n\n\"We asked the parents the optimal time to buy a mobile phone for their children; approximately 19.5% of the parents responded as 6 to 11 years; 59.8% of the parents responded as 12 to 17 years,\" said Dr. Meltem Dinleyici, assistant professor in pediatrics at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine and lead author of the study.\n\n\"According to the parent's responses, 3.3% indicated that there was no need for the presence of a mobile phone for children until the age of 18,\" Dinleyici said.\n\nAbout four out of five, or 81%, of secondary school students in South Africa own or have access to a mobile phone, and about 31% have their own social network page, according to a report published by UNICEF in 2013.\n\nAmong children 9 to 18 in Ghana, 18.8% of boys and 12.9% of girls own a mobile phone, according to a study published in the Journal of International Development in 2015. It also showed that among children in Malawi, 10.4% of boys and 6.2% of girls own a mobile phone.\n\nOverall, according to the study, ownership of mobile phones climbed between 2007 and 2014 from about 0.6% to 8.4% in Malawi, 2.4% to 16.2% in Ghana and 21% to 50.8% in South Africa.\n\nIn a study of fourth-year primary school children in Australia, nearly 31% owned or used a mobile phone at the start of the study. A year later, 43% did, according to their parents.\n\nFor the study, published in the journal Environmental Health in June, data were collected on 412 children from 36 schools in Melbourne and Wollongong between 2010 and 2013.\n\n\"Parents were asked at what age their child first owned or used a mobile phone. The median age was 8 years,\" said Mary Redmayne, an adjunct research fellow at Monash University in Australia and a co-author of the study.\n\n\"It seems that many parents of primary school children want to be able to contact their child, but we have not researched this,\" she said. \"It would be interesting to know other reasons.\"\n\nBest age for a kid's first phone?

    "text": "(CNN) We all use baby talk when we babble with bundles of joy, but does how we talk to infants vary across cultures?\n\nThe answer seems to be yes and no.\n\n\"Some cultures talk more or less to babies, some not at all,\" said Mark VanDam, assistant professor of speech and hearing sciences in the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine at Washington State University.\n\n\"Overall, however, the impulse and act of infant-directed speech seems to be pretty human, not necessarily culturally defined,\" he said.\n\nHere is a sampling of how moms and dads from around the world use infant-directed speech or \"baby talk,\" and why.\n\nHow baby talk might be consistent\n\nMothers around the world consistently alter their voices when talking to their babies, no matter what language they speak, according to a study published in October in the journal Current Biology\n\nParenting Without Borders considers how parenting trends and methods differ -- or don't -- around the world.\n\nResearchers recorded and analyzed the voices of 24 moms with a powerful machine-learning algorithm.\n\nHalf of the women were English speakers, and the others spoke Spanish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, German, French, Hebrew, Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\nDespite their native languages, the study showed, all of the women consistently shifted their timbre -- or the tone and sound of their voice -- when interacting with their infants.\n\nThe researchers were surprised that this shift in sound was a consistent pattern across such a diverse range of languages, said Elise Piazza, associate research scholar at Princeton University and lead author of the study.\n\n\"After we controlled for pitch, we still found timbre differences between infant-directed speech and adult-directed speech,\" Piazza said.\n\nThough some similarities have been seen in how mothers speak to babies, studies have also spotted some cultural differences among both moms and dads.\n\nHow baby talk might differ\n\nA study published in February in the journal Child Development found that dads in North America tended to slow their speech when talking to infants, whereas dads in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu did not. Rather, they tended to shift their pitch more.\n\nResearchers examined 30 interactions between the fathers and their infants, around 7.8 months old. More research is needed in a larger sample of fathers to determine that such differences do, indeed, exist in how these dads baby talk.\n\n\"These are small samples,\" said Greg Bryant, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He conducted the study with Tanya Broesch, assistant professor in the department of psychology at Simon Fraser University\n\n\"The bigger picture is that there are many ways that mothers and fathers can achieve the same communicative effect,\" he said. \"What's universal is that parents often do change their voice when speaking to young children, but how they change exactly could vary across cultures.\"\n\nAs for mothers, a study published last year in the journal PLOS One found a tendency for Lebanese mothers to use more infant-directed speech than American moms.\n\nThe study involved 19 American and 19 Lebanese mothers. The researchers recorded audio of the American moms interacting with their infants in a lab and the Lebanese moms interacting with their infants at home.\n\nThe key difference between the groups was that Lebanese moms had a higher rate in utterances per minute of baby talk than the American moms, the researchers found.\n\nAlthough other research groups have identified differences in baby talk across cultural contexts, this study was the first to report quantitatively on such language differences, the researchers wrote.\n\nStill, the study had some limitations. For instance, American moms were tested in a lab, but Lebanese mothers were tested at home, which could explain the differences.\n\nOn the other hand, it turns out that how babies respond to their parents could vary by culture.\n\nHow babies babble around the globe\n\n\"Babies will often babble with their native sound-sequences,\" VanDam said.\n\n\"For example, we don't have words in English that begin with 'tl,' such as 'tlick,' and English-speaking babies don't tend to babble that way,\" he said, but some Spanish words begin with \"tl.\"\n\n\"We also see sign language babies babbling in sign language, which is fairly strong evidence that it's more of a human trait than some language or culture specific trait,\" VanDam said.\n\nIn other words, as kids develop, their babbling starts to reflect the speech patterns of their native language, Bryant said.\n\nsuggested that infants start understanding words around 6 months old. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in Novembersuggested that infants start understanding words around 6 months old.\n\n\"So mothers and fathers exaggerate vowel categories, for example, so they'll make vowel sounds a little more noticeable, and then that helps the infants acquire the vowel sounds of their language,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people also think that exaggerated features in infant-directed speech help kids learn how to parse the syntax of spoken sentences, but that is a little more controversial,\" he said.\n\nThe changes we tend to make in our voices -- such as exaggerated, repetitive and high-pitched baby talk -- could actually be useful for babies' learning, Piazza said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Baby Sign Language Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Baby Sign Language 02:55\n\n\"Previous experiments have shown that infants segment words and learn the meaning of novel words better from infant-directed than adult-directed speech,\" Piazza said.\n\n\"It also seems to help parents capture babies' attention and engage them emotionally,\" she said. \"Adults are generally motivated to engage infants, and they intuitively know that babies respond well to the exaggerated patterns in baby talk. Infant-directed speech is just one example of tailoring your communication style to a particular audience, which we do all the time.\"\n\nWhy we use baby talk\n\nSome scientists argue that baby talk not only helps infants acquire language, it helps parents form a positive emotional bond with their babies, said Linda Polka, a professor in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at McGill University in Canada.\n\nOther studies suggest that infants prefer high-pitched infant-directed speech and even infant-directed singing, Polka said.\n\nThe reason for this preference remains complex, but research suggests that when adults shift the sound of their voices for \"baby talk,\" that causes them to sound smaller -- as if their voice is coming from a smaller vocal tract, Polka said.\n\n\"Our research shows that babies prefer to listen to speech coming from a smaller infant talker, but we don't know exactly why babies show this preference. Do they simply have a general 'smaller talkers are better' bias, or are they particularly sensitive to how big an infant is?\" Polka said.\n\nIn the future, \"we could figure this out by assessing how they respond to speech sounds that come from a vocal tract that is too small to be an infant. Would they still like it, or would that be less interesting to them?\" she said.\n\nAdditionally, Polka said that whether you are talking to a baby or an adult, research suggests that there is a tendency to shift your speech to sound more like the person who you are interacting with.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"You are more likely to do that when you have a positive regard for the person you're interacting with,\" Polka said.\n\n\"Adjusting our speech to sound smaller when we use baby talk may be a way to convey affect to the baby, by trying to sound like them,\" she said. \"At the same time, it can also help them in terms of their own learning, because we're giving them a chance to listen to a voice that sounds more like them. We may be kind of priming them for their own voice, which is quite distinct from an adult voice.\"",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) The last time most Americans saw Brett Kavanaugh , he was on national television testifying before senators , emotional, angry and insistent that Democratic partisans were trying to destroy him with allegations of sexual assault from decades ago.\n\nNow, as President Donald Trump continues to hold up Kavanaugh as a political trophy, the new Supreme Court justice himself is trying to lower his profile.\n\nFor his formal investiture at the Supreme Court on Thursday, he did not appear for any photographs by the news media and skipped a traditional photo op on the marble steps where the public could have seen -- and protested -- him. (The court cited security concerns .)\n\nKavanaugh also seems inclined against a prominent role at next week's annual meeting of the Federalist Society, the group working with the White House to confirm conservative judges, to which Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first appointee, gave a rousing keynote speech last year.\n\nWithin the court, Kavanaugh has deferred to his colleagues in oral arguments and quickly adhered to the court's institutional traditions. The other justices have gone out of their way to be publicly welcoming and have shown an unusual degree of collegiality all around during arguments so far this term, even laughing more at one another's jokes.\n\nIn the few cases he has handled so far, Kavanaugh has declined some opportunities to favor the Trump administration, separating himself from Gorsuch in early votes. He has aligned more with Chief Justice John Roberts than the far right of the bench.\n\nAll told, Kavanaugh appears to be lying low after the volatile confirmation process and buttressing Roberts' efforts to move the court away from the white-hot media spotlight.\n\nYet Kavanaugh, a political insider who spent 12 years on a US appeals court, also understands that the media scrutiny will fade. The record of Kavanaugh, 53 and appointed for life, will become clear only over many months and years.\n\nFor the law in America, the newest of the nine represents only part of a momentous change underway. For years as the justices met privately to decide cases in a rich oak-paneled conference room, the person whose views mattered most was Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded.\n\nA conservative with centrist tendencies on social issues -- including abortion, race and gay rights -- Kennedy was regularly the deciding vote. Like the lawyers who stood at the lectern and publicly argued before the high court, individual justices often tailored their arguments around the private conference table to Kennedy.\n\nNot one of the current nine has a similar centrist approach. Justices on both sides of the ideological divide are watching Kavanaugh for any clues about how to best approach the new justice.\n\nKavanaugh was carefully vetted by a Trump team that did not want a vacillating jurist in the mode of Kennedy.\n\nGorsuch has fulfilled those expectations , often partnering on the far right with Justice Clarence Thomas for an originalist approach to the law, tied to the Constitution's 18th-century origins.\n\nKavanaugh's style is different and he appears to be trying to make good on his oft-repeated confirmation mantra about \"always being a team player on the team of nine.\"\n\nWhere Gorsuch immediately opted against having his clerks join the clerk pool that collectively screens petitions for certiorari, seeking review of cases lost in lower courts, Kavanaugh has had his clerks join. (All justices but Gorsuch and Samuel Alito are in the so-called cert pool, which dates to the 1970s.)\n\nIn the private conference, the junior justice has the responsibility of taking notes on the proceedings and answering the door if any aide knocks to offer a document or even a fetched set of forgotten reading glasses or a coffee cup requested by a justice.\n\nThat person is now Kavanaugh. He will also be last in line to cast his vote. In tight cases, he likely would be the fifth conservative, sealing a victory for the right wing. Or he may prove unpredictable, perhaps even defying his benefactor.\n\nBefore this week's midterm elections, as Trump tried to rally Republicans, he constantly invoked Kavanaugh's appointment and the Democratic opposition he faced. The day after the election, the President boasted that the Kavanaugh strategy paid off.\n\n\"By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings,\" Trump said at a White House news conference.\n\n\"Tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' 05:29\n\nPlaying nice in public\n\nKavanaugh's response to the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford prompted some lawyers and judges, including retired Justice John Paul Stevens, to question his temperament and ability to be an impartial jurist.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, Kavanaugh described Ford's claims as part of \"a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election ... revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\"\n\nIndividual justices are conflicted over how Kavanaugh's confirmation unfolded, yet all have an incentive to be collegial and forward-looking. They have projected a \"business as usual\" image, even appearing to be getting along better on the bench.\n\nKavanaugh has now sat through three weeks of oral arguments. He has held back and let his colleagues air their queries before jumping in. He also has tried to take opportunities to question both sides in fractious cases, perhaps to avoid being labeled with a predictably conservative approach.\n\nFellow justices have shown regard for his questioning, occasionally picking up on his line of inquiry.\n\n\"What the treaty seems to prevent,\" Justice Elena Kagan observed to a lawyer at the lectern in one case, \"is the state from taking either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods.\"\n\nAt another point, Kagan, who sits next to Kavanaugh on the bench, said, \"I think the import of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the usual case. ... \"\n\nIn a separate dispute, after Kavanaugh had tried to enter the fray but was interrupted, Roberts stopped the lawyer at the lectern. \"I think Justice Kavanaugh had a question,\" Roberts said, ensuring Kavanaugh an opening.\n\nLater in the same argument, Kavanaugh said, \"to pick up on the chief justice's comments. ... \"\n\nJUST WATCHED Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution 02:02\n\nStaying close to the chief justice\n\nWhile they are united in public, with Kennedy's departure the court is more divided on the substance of the law, split between five conservatives (Roberts, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Clarence Thomas) and four liberals (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan).\n\nYet the chief justice has been determined to show that the court is above politics. Roberts may end up inching to the left himself in some cases, to avoid some 5-4 splits, and may find a new ally in Kavanaugh.\n\nHow those justices on the right band together -- or not -- could make a difference in the cases the court takes up and the fate of long-standing precedents, for example on abortion rights. Where Kavanaugh falls on the ideological spectrum could also affect larger constitutional dilemmas, provoked by Trump's demonstrated disregard for legal norms.\n\nKavanaugh and Roberts, a decade older at 63, have known each other for nearly 30 years. Both served in the US Solicitor General's Office during the George H.W. Bush administration, Roberts as a deputy SG and Kavanaugh on a fellowship for young lawyers. During the George W. Bush administration, Kavanaugh obtained top legal jobs and Roberts won court appointments, first to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in 2003, and then to the Supreme Court, in 2005.\n\nKavanaugh himself then served on the DC Circuit, reinforcing their common path. They have long had a friendly relationship.\n\nLast month, when Kavanaugh underwent a ceremonial investiture at the White House, following his 50-48 confirmation vote by the Senate, he went out of his way to praise Roberts.\n\n\"Chief Justice Roberts is a principled, independent and inspiring leader for the American judiciary,\" Kavanaugh said. \"As a country, we are fortunate to have John Roberts as chief justice of the United States.\"\n\nRoberts returned the favorable comments when he spoke of judicial independence, after referring to \"the contentious events in Washington,\" at the University of Minnesota the following week.\n\n\"As our newest colleague put it, we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation,\" Roberts said.\n\nNot siding with Trump -- yet\n\nThe 2018-19 session, which began a week before Kavanaugh was seated last month, is still so new that he and most justices have yet to issue any written opinions. But Kavanaugh has taken actions that separate him from the conservative stalwarts.\n\nIn late October, when the court took up a challenge to the Commerce Department's addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, Kavanaugh was with the majority in allowing lower court proceedings to continue and testimony to be taken from a key Justice Department lawyer in the dispute, while his fellow conservatives Gorsuch and Thomas dissented. (Separately, the full court blocked the challengers from obtaining testimony from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.)\n\nA week later, on November 2, the court by a 6-3 vote rejected a subsequent administration request to postpone the trial . Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch publicly dissented, but Kavanaugh, who may have been predicted to join them, did not.\n\nThat same day, the Supreme Court -- again over public dissents from Thomas and Gorsuch -- rejected a Trump administration request to block a lawsuit by youths who want to hold the government responsible for emissions policy and climate change.\n\nIn none of those three matters did Kavanaugh write anything that became public.\n\nTrump had no public comment on any of them, either. The President still speaks enthusiastically of his new nominee and suggests he believes the high court will be more on his side.\n\nWhen a federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a decision that blocked the administration from ending an Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the United States when young from deportation, Trump said he would be happy to take the case to the nine.\n\n\"We want to be in the Supreme Court on DACA,\" Trump told reporters Friday morning, later adding, \"where we'll be given a fair decision.\"\n\nAnd earlier in the week, before Tuesday's elections, the President raised Kavanaugh's name to rally campaign crowds. He cast Kavanaugh as a victim of false accusers and their Democratic enablers.\n\n\"False accusations. False accusations,\" Trump said. \"They want to ruin a man or a woman. Ruin a man.\"",

    "text": "There are the obvious reasons, not the least of which is her place in the history books as the first female House speaker.\n\nBut it is more than that. It is how she got there -- excelling in a man's world and playing in what was traditionally a boy's club of politics -- as well as, and often better than, her male counterparts.\n\nShe's had plenty of detractors and naysayers, even among Democrats. But she is seen as effective, so much so that even her political opponents -- mostly men -- have repeatedly told me over the years that they marvel at her leadership of her caucus.\n\nFor all the interviews Pelosi does, she doesn't talk often about her struggles and challenges as a woman. But here, she spoke quite candidly about it all.\n\n\"I get some names called, because if you're effective as a woman, then they have to undermine you, because that's a real threat,\" Pelosi told us in an interview.\n\n\"I'm probably more of a target than anybody, except for somebody who runs for president,\" she said.\n\nTalk about an understatement. For years Pelosi has been the ultimate Republican boogeyman -- or boogeywoman, as it were. She's a frequent target of Republican ire for being too far to the left -- and she's also a target among progressives for not being far left enough.\n\nSome fellow Democrats are now distancing themselves from Pelosi, promising not to vote for her as House speaker again even though her party has won a majority in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections and shifted the power dynamics in President Donald Trump's Washington.\n\nSo far, no one has emerged to challenge her. And Pelosi is unmoved.\n\n\"I have a broad base of support in the country, financially, politically, and otherwise, which is valuable to our caucus,\" argued Pelosi.\n\n\"None of us is indispensable, but some of us are just better at our jobs than others,\" she added matter-of-factly.\n\nShe toots her own horn to show women how it's done\n\nAs she was telling me how qualified she is to be House speaker again, it struck me how unusual it is to hear a woman talk so confidently about how uniquely qualified she is for a job or position she is seeking. Though I am no shrinking violet, it is often hard for me to toot my own horn that way, something I admitted in the moment to Pelosi.\n\n\"For most women, frankly, myself included, it is hard to say those words, 'I am uniquely qualified. I deserve this. I earned this. I can do this better than anyone else,'\" I told Pelosi.\n\n\"You know why I do it? I do it, because I want women to see that you do not get pushed around. You don't run away from the fight,\" she responded.\n\nWhere it all started: Little Italy, Baltimore\n\nI have covered Pelosi for years, and always wondered how she learned to operate and excel in politics the way she does.\n\nFor the answer, we went with Pelosi back to where it all started: Little Italy, in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was born to US Rep. Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. and Anunciata D'Alesandro.\n\nWhen she was six years old, her father became Baltimore's first Catholic mayor.\n\n\"He leapfrogged over the Irish. That was a big deal, but it took political organizing to do that,\" Pelosi explained in an interview at Sabatino's, an Italian restaurant she frequented with her family growing up.\n\nMuch has been made of her father's influence on her. Less known is her mother's. Anunciata, who also went by Nancy, was an inventor who patented a device to apply steam to the face -- effectively an at home facial.\n\nBut she didn't pursue that passion. She was held back, Pelosi has said, by the times -- and by her father.\n\nInstead, Pelosi's mother helped her father in politics, who was a US representative from Maryland's 3rd Congressional District before he went on to be mayor.\n\n\"My mother was very much a part of the organizing. My father was the orator,\" recalled Pelosi.\n\nHer older brothers said their mother ran what they jokingly called her \"moccasin brigade\" of other women who would go to political events and get the message out.\n\n\"There are two things about what I bring with me from my family in this regard,\" Pelosi said. \"One is to know how to count. That's very important. Count your votes to win the election. Count your votes to win a vote on the floor. The other is listen to your constituents.\"\n\nBut Pelosi says the idea that because she grew up in politics, she always knew that was where she was headed is a myth.\n\n\"People are always saying, 'Oh, she knew when she was a little girl she wanted to run for office.' I never thought of that at all, ever, until I did,\" she insisted.\n\nAfter college, she wanted to go to law school. Instead, like many in her generation, she got married and started a family.\n\n\"When I got married and I had a baby, and then another baby, five in six years,\" Pelosi recalled.\n\nThe Pelosis moved back to husband Paul's hometown of San Francisco. Over the years, she became more and more active in the Democratic Party. But it wasn't until her youngest daughter, Alexandra, was a senior in high school that she ran for an open House seat.\n\nPelosi tells the story that she went to Alexandra and told her she had a chance to run for Congress. She said her daughter's response was \"get a life.\"\n\n\"And I did,\" Pelosi added.\n\nPelosi in 'awe' of female lawmakers with young children\n\nWhether she planned it or not, the path that Pelosi took to the House is the one most women used to follow. Women raised their kids, and then they went into politics. \"I was sequential,\" is how Pelosi explains her experience and that of the few women of her generation who actually ran for office.\n\nBut that's not the case anymore. Historic numbers of women with young children were already serving in the House and Senate before the election, and that will spike even more once the new 116th Congress is sworn in early next year.\n\nShe says she is in awe of the women she serves and works with who are in the throes of parenting.\n\n\"I want more young women in Congress who are in the course of raising their children, because it's important for women in that situation to see someone who shares their experience at the table,\" she said.\n\n\"Being a mom, what are you? You're a diplomat, interpersonal relationships. You're a chef. You're a chauffeur. You're a problem solver. You're a nurse. You're a health care provider. You have so much, and that's just with the children, not to mention the other aspects of family,\" said Pelosi, who notes that motherhood made her much more efficient.\n\n\"I don't think that before I had five children in six years that I used time as effectively as I did as a mom. ... I didn't even have time sometimes to wash my face,\" she laughed, knowing every mother can relate.\n\nThe young kids by her side now are her grandchildren. Two of them, Paul and Thomas, were at the podium for her election night victory speech when Democrats learned they'd retaken control of the House.\n\nNot long ago, Democratic men didn't think much of women in leadership\n\nRight now, a historic 102 women are set to be sworn into the House, and that number could rise even more as a handful of outstanding races are decided.\n\nWhen Pelosi got to the House in 1987, there were only 26 women serving. She says having five older brothers came in handy.\n\n\"Growing up in a family of boys helped me, because I was unimpressed,\" she said.\n\nWhen she first ran for House leadership 18 years ago, her male Democratic colleagues didn't get it.\n\n\"When people came to me and said, 'You should run for leadership,' and I agreed to look at it, then some of the men said, 'Who said she could run?' That was a real motivator.\"\n\nShe also remembers the men being told that \"a lot of the women are supporting Nancy to run.\"\n\nThe men responded by saying, \"'Well, why? Do the women have a list of things they want us to do? Why don't they just make a list and give us the list?' This is the Democratic Party in the year 2000,\" Pelosi recalls, a tone of disbelief still in her voice.\n\nHow does she wield power differently than a man?\n\nPelosi says that after meetings, people ask her, \"Do you understand how different that meeting would have been if a man were conducting it?\"\n\nShe says she is told that she listens more carefully than men who conduct meetings.\n\n\"You build consensus,\" Pelosi adds.\n\nShe used that female sensibility to gather votes for hard-to-pass legislation many times over the years, but passing the Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as Obamacare, is probably the prime example.\n\nIt has been widely reported that in January 2010, after Senate Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority when Republican Scott Brown won a special election, many thought passing the Affordable Care Act, which was not going to get GOP votes, was a lost cause. But Pelosi convinced then-President Barack Obama and others in the White House that it was doable -- and, along with then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, they got it done.\n\nTo be sure, the GOP backlash contributed to Democrats losing control of the House in 2010 and Pelosi losing the speakership. But it hasn't been repealed, and she still counts that -- getting Democrats to vote yes despite, for many, the political peril, as one of her biggest legislative accomplishments.\n\nHer advice for women transcends politics\n\n\"Have you ever been to a meeting when you're at the table, and a woman makes a suggestion, and then they go to the next person, and then two persons later a man makes the same suggestion, the other gentleman at the table say, 'That's a great idea'\"? Pelosi asked me.\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, because, what woman hasn't had that experience?\n\n\"What I have learned later in life, I've concluded, that the reason that they didn't recognize the merit when a woman suggested it is they didn't even listen. They did not even listen to the woman. That's why I say to people, 'Make sure that you have a give-and-take on what you suggest, because some man's going to get the credit for your idea.'\"\n\nShe says she likely would have stepped down had Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton become president. But when Clinton lost, Pelosi felt compelled to stay on so that there would still be a woman at the table for high-level meetings.\n\nShe calls President Donald Trump \"respectful of the office that I have,\" but notes they didn't have many bipartisan meetings to date.\n\nTrump praised Pelosi last week during his post-midterms news conference in the White House.\n\n\"I gave her a lot of credit, she works very hard and she's worked long and hard,\" he said when asked about opportunities for bipartisanship and working across the aisle. \"I give her a great deal of credit for how she's worked and what she's accomplished.\"\n\nWith her on track to hold the speaker's gavel again next year, that's likely to change -- and it will be up Pelosi to take her own advice for women.\n\n\"You know what the subjects are,\" she said. \"You know how to get it done. Be your authentic self. Be yourself. Know your power.\"",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) The Justice Department is expected to issue an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel on Tuesday that will defend Matthew Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general under federal law, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAlmost immediately after President Donald Trump appointed Whitaker last week, various high-profile lawyers, professors and former Justice officials have weighed in on the legality of the move and more formal legal challenges are widely expected soon.\n\nSome legal scholars -- as well as George Conway , the husband of Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway -- have said they thought Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he is not a Senate-confirmed official. Yet others have argued that the appointment is valid because he's only serving on a temporary basis under the Federal Vacancies Act.\n\nOLC serves as the chief interpreter of federal law for the administration, but its conclusions are not binding on federal courts, and Tuesday's opinion is unlikely to abate the brewing controversy over Whitaker's appointment.\n\nTop Democrats on Capitol Hill have slammed Trump's decision to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general, skipping over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- the next Justice official in the succession line who is Senate-confirmed and was previously overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. While Rosenstein is still managing the probe on a day-to-day basis, Whitaker's critics have worried that he could take steps to curtail Mueller's work given his past fierce criticism of the probe.\n\nRead More",

    "text": "(CNN) Donald Trump just co-opted a new buzz phrase he hopes will define the next two years in politics: \"Presidential harassment.\"\n\nHis jab at the tactics of the incoming Democratic House represents an early effort to spin a new era of investigations and oversight that is about to shake the White House as a power grab by his opposition.\n\nTrump's appropriation on Twitter of a concept first coined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last week , points to the critical nature of the fight the President must wage to safeguard his hold on power, one that will surely start to feel pressure as lawmakers return to Capitol Hill with newly-elected members in tow.\n\nTrump's comment is also a reminder to Democrats that any sign they are persecuting the President without grounds, or acting unfairly could harm them with moderate voters who swapped sides in the midterm elections.\n\n\"The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!\" Trump tweeted Monday, falsely blaming his foes for a sell-off motivated by jitters in the tech sector.\n\nThe prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nBut the President's intervention did underline how Washington's calendar seems to have already flipped to 2019.\n\nTrump and Democratic leaders are making calculations and staking out positions that will shape the new political environment, set the stage for the 2020 election, and could ultimately dictate Trump's political fate.\n\nThe arrival of a new class of lawmakers for orientation Tuesday will exacerbate the feeling of a fresh start, though critical business remains in the lame duck twilight of the GOP-led House \u2014 that could even degenerate into a government shutdown before year's end.\n\nOn talk shows in recent days, incoming Democratic committee chairmen fleshed out earlier promises to look into Trump's policies and personal affairs.\n\nAt the same time, the likely next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to keep talk of impeachment f rom bubbling over.\n\nSome Washington veterans are already seeking parallels from the past, including the period after the 1994 midterms, when a new GOP majority that came to be seen as overzealous gave President Bill Clinton a foil that he used to win re-election two years on.\n\nWith that in mind, House Democrats know they have to do enough to appease their voters outraged by Trump, 77% of whom, according to exit polls, support impeachment.\n\nBut moving too fast could harm the credibility of Democratic oversight and foster an impression it is motivated by purely political motives rather than being in the national interest, and could offer Trump an opening.\n\nThe party must also keep faith with the policy agenda that helped them win last week. That involves passing bills on securing coverage for Americans with pre-existing health conditions, acting to control the cost of college, and possibly working on infrastructure, even if most such measures hit a brick wall in the GOP Senate.\n\n\"I think the key word is balance in this,\" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank.\n\n\"There needs to be aggressive oversight of this administration,\" Kessler said. \"There has been no oversight for two years. I think the watchword would be -- make these investigations in the taxpayers' interests.\"\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman, one of Trump's most aggressive critics on Russia, says the political delicacy of the coming clash is one reason Democrats should retain Pelosi as leader, and speaker, even if more radical members of the new class want change.\n\n\"We need the strongest general that we have,\" Schiff said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend. \"We need the best tactician, we need the best organizer.\"\n\nPelosi wants her party to stay unified and temperate as they erect the new checks and balances against the President.\n\n\"We are responsible. We are not scatter shot. We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose but to seek the truth,\" she said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, a message she repeated in a letter to members Monday\n\n\"I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic,\" she told CBS.\n\nTrump's new reality\n\nThe President has been in a dark place since election day, as Democratic gains in slow moving counts underscored his rebuke by voters.\n\nHe and his top officials will soon be facing Democratic probes, hearings and potentially subpoenas on everything from his unreleased tax returns to the family separations storm, from his alleged obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe to his family finances.\n\nHe is already seeking to brand Democrats as a party obsessed with attacking him, while ignoring the challenges he believes many Americans care about, like the humming economy and what he sees as an immigration crisis.\n\nHe is leaving open the door to cooperation on some issues but warning that once Democrats crank up investigations, he is ready to use his power to target them, and grind government to a halt.\n\n\"I would blame them because they now are going to be coming up with policy. They're the majority in the House,\" the President said at a post midterm election news conference last week.\n\nTrump's first goal is to curate the battlefield ahead of his re-election bid in 2020 after Democratic gains repaired gaps in the party's blue wall in the Midwest that Trump tore down in 2016.\n\nBut, with the possibility of impeachment looming, depending on the contents of Mueller's final report, the President knows he must also act to shore up his support base in Congress, especially in the Senate.\n\nThere is no sign at this stage that there would be a two-thirds majority in the GOP-led chamber to convict him after any successful impeachment push in the House -- a factor that may convince Democratic leaders to avoid such a route.\n\nBut the most dangerous threat to his presidency -- as unlikely as it seems now -- would lie in any gathering political weakness that would erode his support among Senate Republicans.\n\nAfter all, President Richard Nixon resigned during Watergate not after admitting guilt, but after concluding that he no longer had \"strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing\" in office.\n\nTrump's desire to avoid a similar fate seems to lie behind his own obsessive efforts to bolster his political \"base\" and to show Republican lawmakers they would face a terrible price in their districts from deserting him. It also helps explain the aggressive campaign to discredit Mueller's \"witch hunt\" undertaken with the enthusiastic aid of conservative media.\n\nThe opening shots between Trump and resurgent Democrats show that the political battle between each end of Pennsylvania Avenue will be bitter and prolonged.\n\nAt the outset of this existential clash, it is less clear whether, given the polarization in Congress and the nation, there is any potential resolution, however it turns out, that will spare the stressed political system even more blows to its tattered legitimacy.",

    "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is intensifying his challenge to constitutional constraints and governing norms that are already facing their gravest test since Watergate in the 1970s.\n\nTrump has reacted to the coming Democratic majority in the House by upping the assault on the Washington system he was elected to upend, but in a way that could be taking the nation into perilous political territory.\n\nIn the days since the fracturing of the Republican majority on power in Washington, Trump has challenged political order across a broad front.\n\nThe President has installed Matthew Whitaker, an acolyte who shares his skepticism of the Mueller probe as acting attorney general. In addition, he has stoked conspiracy theories about stolen elections in the wake of Florida's latest vote counting controversy and has threatened to use the mechanisms of government to investigate Democrats if they investigate him.\n\nAnd he has stepped up his assault on the press, including by confiscating the White House pass of CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who asked multiple, challenging questions of Trump during a White House news conference.\n\nAll of this came days after Trump used his power as commander-in-chief to dispatch troops to the border to meet what he said was an imminent criminal invasion from a migrant caravan that is yet to materialize.\n\nThe President's moves, with the prospect of more to come, have precipitated a surreal moment in politics, with Washington veterans debating whether a constitutional crisis is looming \u2014 or whether it is already here.\n\nDoes the acting AG threaten the rule of law?\n\nThe current epicenter of the debate concerns Whitaker, the former chief of staff to fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions who took his boss's job.\n\n\"He should never have been appointed and ... it does violence to the Constitution and the vision of our founders to appoint such a person in such a manner to be the chief legal officer in our country,\" the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nGrowing questions over Whitaker's position will hike pressure on the President to swiftly nominate a permanent attorney general. But that nominee will face an inquisition from the Republican-led Senate over their positions on the Russia probe.\n\nWhitaker's critics fear he will refuse to sign off on subpoenas Mueller might request, narrow the mandate of his investigation or suppress the special counsel's final report.\n\nHis appointment has raised fears that the President intends to use him to derail the Russia investigation. That is a realistic possibility since Trump already admitted in an NBC interview last year that he fired FBI Director James Comey because of the investigation -- a move that critics say in itself amounts to an abuse of power and obstruction of justice.\n\nWhitaker appears unlikely to heed calls to recuse himself from the probe given a decision by Sessions to do so sparked Trump's fury and poisoned his tenure.\n\nIt may fall to the new Democratic House majority, therefore, to act as a check on any attempts by Trump to use Whitaker to interfere with Mueller, despite the President's challenge to legal norms represented by his appointment.\n\nFlorida, Florida, Florida\n\nThe President has frequently made claims of massive voter fraud in the United States, despite the fact that all available evidence suggests that it is not a significant problem.\n\nSo it is no surprise that he has leapt into action to proclaim that Florida's latest vote controversy is a flagrant example of Democratic larceny at the polls.\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" Trump tweeted Monday morning after having spent the weekend in Paris.\n\nAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\n\nNo one is disputing the Sunshine's State's unfortunate tendency to trigger election controversy. And answers are overdue about the stewardship of elections in Broward and Palm Beach counties for instance.\n\nLawyers for Democratic and Republican candidates are now launching dueling campaigns. Each side has every right to make their case after the state's Republican secretary of state ordered recounts to begin given thin margins.\n\n\"Every vote should be counted, but, by gosh, not let fraudulent or anti-Constitutional behavior prevail,\" Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who ran the Republican Senate midterm campaign, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nBut Trump seems to be reacting not to evidence of fraud, but to vote counts that are narrowing the gap between Democratic Senate and gubernatorial candidates Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum and the presumed Republican victors.\n\nThus the Florida controversy marks the latest occasion when he is prioritizing his personal interests over a President's duty to protect the nation's democracy.\n\nBut by intervening personally in the race, the President is casting doubt on the integrity of the election and potentially risking long-term damage to America's political system itself, which relies on public consent.\n\nHis furious intervention contrasts with the reaction of President Bill Clinton during an even higher-stakes confrontation in Florida, the bitterly contested recount in the 2000 presidential election, eventually handed to George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore by the Supreme Court.\n\nClinton took steps to avoid politicizing the process, reasoning that America's system depended on him staying out of it.\n\n\"I don't think I should be involved in that,\" Clinton said soon after the disputed election.\n\nTrump's intervention 18 years later is one reason why his critics fear he is oblivious or disdainful of traditional norms governing presidential behavior.\n\nLashing out at scrutiny\n\nThe Democratic capture of the House guarantees an uncomfortable period of investigation and oversight for the White House that the Republican majority deemed unnecessary during his first two years in office.\n\n\"They can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\" Trump said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nIn the latest worrying sign for the President, top Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler told Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that Democrats would examine hush payments to women who allege past affairs with Trump that may infringe campaign finance laws.\n\n\"That might very well be an impeachable offense,\" Nadler said.\n\nTrump has denied the alleged affairs.\n\nThe President already reacted with fury to the notion of a new era of scrutiny from Democrats, promising a \"warlike\" posture if it took place, and hinted he could use the mechanisms of government to investigate them during a news conference last week.\n\nThe President also acted in a way many observers fear raises First Amendment questions by taking the unprecedented step of confiscating Acosta's permanent White House press pass after he questioned the President on the migrant caravan.\n\nHow deep is the crisis?\n\nEvents of the last few days point clearly to an escalating challenge by the White House to political conventions and guardrails, one that could further sharpen if Trump's reshuffle of top officials rids him of remaining restraining influences.\n\nIt is more difficult to assess whether the President's actions have already tipped the nation into a constitutional crisis or whether the system of checks and balances has kept him on the right side of that line.\n\nAfter all, two years after he was elected, voters did decide to introduce new accountability in Washington with a Democratic House after Republicans gave no sign they were willing to rein in the President's excesses.\n\nThe courts have tempered some of Trump's most radical ideas, watering down a Muslim travel ban he authored early in his presidency. Trump's new use of executive power to limit asylum claims, in an apparent contravention of international law, will soon get its own day in court.\n\nBut political systems need to be nurtured constantly if they are to remain healthy. And the President's rhetoric on the Florida controversy especially seems to edge close to the danger zone.\n\nOne veteran observer, Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Clinton and defense secretary under President Barack Obama, believes the nation's institutions are standing firm.\n\n\"I think ultimately the institutions that our forefathers put in place are strong enough to be able to survive any administration,\" Panetta said Thursday on \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nBut the fact that the question is even relevant is testimony to the darkening mood in Washington.",

    "text": "And now, some are considering whether to oust her.\n\nTen incoming freshmen \u2014 all from competitive districts \u2014 pledged during their campaigns to oppose Pelosi for speaker of the House. Their calls came as Republicans dropped millions in purple and red districts to tie Democrats to the longtime San Francisco liberal, a woman depicted as the face of the resistance in ads splashed across TV screens all over America.\n\nThe candidates faced immense pressure to distance themselves from her. Abigail Spanberger, who beat incumbent Republican David Brat in Virginia, was crystal clear. \"I won't vote for her under any circumstances,\" Spanberger told Roll Call, and she told CNN on Monday that she wants a leader who would \"heal some of the divisions in our communities.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, Joe Cunningham, who defeated Republican Katie Arrington, announced his position early on Twitter.\n\n\"The Democratic Party needs new leadership now. If elected, I will not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker. Time to move forward and win again,\" he tweeted, telling CNN on Monday that on the speaker issue, \"My position has been the same since day one, and that has not changed.\"\n\nAnd in Michigan, Elissa Slotkin, who defeated incumbent Republican Mike Bishop, told her local station prior to being elected, \"I have made very clear, publicly that I would not support Nancy Pelosi as our next speaker.\"\n\nBut as the freshmen come to Washington this week, they are also under growing pressure from their caucus to avoid a messy floor fight and to back Pelosi after she's expected to win the Democratic nomination for speaker later this month. If they don't, they risk provoking chaos in their new majority -- while alienating themselves with their new colleagues and party leaders who could help them ascend in their caucus and land plum committee spots.\n\nPublicly, Pelosi was nonchalant during the campaign. Her message to those candidates: \"Just win, baby.\" She went on to raise more than $6.7 million for the party's program that supports candidates aiming to flip their districts for Democrats -- many of whom opposed Pelosi. Overall, Pelosi raised $129 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nThe midterms are over, and as those elected candidates head to Washington and with no challenger willing to step forward to run against her, they'll continue to face pressure to either carry through with their campaign promise to oppose Pelosi, or unite with the rest of the caucus and support her in the end. Neither Cunningham nor Spanberger would name an alternative candidate to Pelosi whom they would support.\n\n\"I don't know who may step forward, but I really do think that it's incredibly important that if we are going to change the conversation in Washington we need to change the people having it and directing it,\" Spanberger told CNN. \"It's not in any way a negative assessment that the job that anybody is doing but at times cyclical change, I believe, is a good thing.\"\n\nCunningham is going to wait and meet fellow members in DC soon, saying he can \"name on one hand\" the number of Congressmen and women that he has met before.\n\nTechnically, they could do both. The freshmen could oppose Pelosi in the initial caucus vote for speaker nominee on November 28. Pelosi only needs support from the majority of the caucus to clinch the nomination, so she can afford to lose these members in that first round of voting.\n\nBut those who oppose Pelosi initially will be urged to unify with the rest of the caucus and support her during the final floor vote in January. On Monday, a group of 14 Democrats issued a letter urging the caucus to stand behind the eventual nominee on the floor. Powerful outside groups, like End Citizens United and Emily's List, have also expressed support for Pelosi.\n\nSome incoming freshmen have already been clear they will not support Pelosi under any scenario -- \"I am not going to vote for her. No ifs, ands or buts, under any circumstances,\" Max Rose of New York said Monday on Fox -- while others haven't been as specific.\n\nMany of the incoming freshmen are already getting calls from both sides, offering them encouragement and support as they navigate their new environment.\n\n\"We will need to do what's best for our districts, no matter who's calling us,\" Slotkin told CNN on Monday.\n\nCNN projects Democrats so far have a 225-seat majority, so Pelosi would need to shore up support from over 90% of her caucus to reach that 218 threshold on the floor.\n\nTraditionally, that's easy. There are rarely few defections from the party of a speaker nominee during the final vote. Even when 63 Democrats voted against Pelosi in the leadership election in 2016, almost all of them ended up voting for her on the floor.\n\nOne Democratic strategist and former top official at the DCCC -- who asked not to be named due to their work with 2018 races -- said new members will still be able to say they opposed Pelosi in the caucus vote, but opposing her on the floor could help Republicans.\n\n\"Voting against her in caucus is what they promised to do - to try to get someone else,\" the strategist said. \"Voting against her on the floor is a vote for Trump and (House Republican Leader Kevin) McCarthy, and that's not what they told voters. In fact, it would effectively overturn the election result.\"\n\nDemocrats who oppose Pelosi don't have to vote for the Republican nominee on the floor -- they can voice any name they like. But if enough Democrats don't vote for the Democratic nominee, then it could ultimately help tip the scales for the Republican choice.\n\nBut Pelosi may not necessarily need 218 votes after all. Due to procedural rules, if some members vote \"present,\" that could lower the threshold and she could win with fewer than 218 votes.\n\nPelosi detractors argue that urging these freshmen to support Pelosi on the floor could be politically damaging for them, given that it's their first vote as members of Congress.\n\n\"Leadership asking new members to make a choice: break campaign promise on your 1st vote, or stand up to a status quo that will punish you,\" Rep. Seth Moulton posted Friday on Twitter. \"We've been fielding lots of calls from incumbents. We're the voices of a silent majority who want new leadership & to protect new members.\"\n\nThe caucus is expected to debate a proposal this week that would change the caucus rules and make it more difficult for anyone to secure the speaker nomination, including Pelosi. Incoming freshmen, in town for orientation this week, will get a first-hand look at the party's internal dispute over its leadership on Capitol Hill -- a split that many want to avoid fresh after a major victory.\n\nA day after winning back the House last week, Pelosi was boasting about the unprecedented number of women who were elected to the House. A reporter pointed out that some of those women say they won't support her.\n\n\"What I say to those women: Congratulations on your election,\" she said. \"Welcome.\"",

    "text": "The results of last week's election demonstrated how powerfully national trends now shape election outcomes in every region. The election produced remarkably consistent divides along demographic and geographic lines in states as diverse as Arizona, Georgia and Texas on one side, and Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on the other. Though some important regional differences remained, voters who shared the same characteristics or resided in similar places largely voted the same way no matter what state they lived in.\n\nIn virtually every state, Democrats last Tuesday displayed a clear advantage in densely populated, culturally and racially diverse white-collar metropolitan areas, while Republicans relied on elevated margins in the preponderantly white, religiously traditional, smaller places beyond them. In almost all cases, the outcome in each state was determined less by how much they varied from that persistent pattern than by how much of each group was present in the state's electorate to begin with.\n\nThe continued nationalization of American politics threatens greater polarization and social tension as the lines harden between these two distinct political coalitions. But paradoxically, it means that the party that can generate the most exceptions to these solidifying trends may be the one most likely to control Congress and the White House.\n\nWhether measured by demography or geography, the 2018 election produced remarkably consistent patterns.\n\nA surprise twist among older voters\n\nViewed by age, the results offered a vivid portrait of the price Republicans are paying among younger voters as Trump redefines the party in his confrontational image.\n\nThe exit poll measuring preferences in House elections found that Democrats carried fully two thirds of voters aged 18-29. That was their best showing with them in exit polls since at least 1986 (narrowly exceeding their level even in former President Barack Obama's sweeping 2008 victory) and a big improvement on Hillary Clinton's 55% among them in 2016. And preliminary calculations indicate that youth turnout may have been half again as large in 2018 as it was in 2014, the most recent midterm.\n\nEven more striking was the consistency of the Democratic advantage around the nation. The Democratic candidate won voters aged 18-29 in all 21 Senate races with an exit poll except for Indiana, where Joe Donnelly tied Republican Mike Braun. (These figures do not include the exit poll in California, where two Democrats ran against each other after claiming the top spots in last June's state top-two primary.) Senate Democrats carried about three-fifths or more of these younger voters in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota (both for incumbent Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, who was elected in a special election), Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Democrats also reached at least 60% with them in governor's races in Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In the California governor's race, Democrat Gavin Newsom carried 69% of younger voters.\n\nJust as important, the Democratic advantage extended up the age ladder. Against Trump in 2016, Clinton carried only 51% of voters aged 30-44; while Trump won just 41% of them, a substantial 8% scattered to third-party candidates.\n\nThis time, those voters consolidated behind Democrats. In the national House exit poll, Democrats won 58%. The margins weren't always as large in the Senate races with exit polls. But every Democratic Senate candidate carried the voters in this age group except for Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. In states from Pennsylvania, Minnesota (both races) and Wisconsin to Florida and Nevada, Democrats carried about three-fifths of these voters. (The Arizona exit poll results combined voters aged 18-44: Democrat Kyrsten Sinema carried 59% of the combined group.)\n\nRepublicans in turn consistently performed better with older voters -- though with a surprising crack in their armor. In the national House exit poll, voters aged 45-64 split almost exactly evenly between the two parties. But Republicans won them, often convincingly, in most of the closely contested Senate races, including Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. That group of older workers, often described as the \"anxious generation\" facing the final years before retirement, has emerged as a key Republican constituency.\n\nThe results among seniors, though, were competitive. About four-fifths of today's seniors are white and they have moved right in recent elections: Trump won them in 2016, and Republicans have consistently carried them in recent congressional contests, exit polls have found. But this year they split about evenly in the national House exit poll (48% for Democrats versus 50% for Republicans) and in the state races they scattered more than most groups.\n\nRepublicans won them convincingly in the contested Senate races in Florida, Tennessee, Indiana, Missouri, Texas and Nevada; but Democrats won them with solid margins in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, carried them narrowly in North Dakota and West Virginia and essentially split them in Montana and Wisconsin. (In the tight Arizona Senate race, Republican Martha McSally comfortably carried voters in the combined category of 45 and older.)\n\nThe racial and educational divide grows\n\nAcross the country, the results converged along educational lines too.\n\nIn the national House exit poll, Republicans carried 61% of whites without a college education, Trump's best group. It's difficult to precisely compare that to previous years, because the exit polls changed the way they weight the results for education. What is clear from last week's results is the Republican advantage with these voters persisted in all regions: Klobuchar in Minnesota was the only Democratic Senate candidate to win most white voters without a college education, although Tester and Manchin came close.\n\nBoth Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Claire McCaskill in Missouri, who had shown appeal to these voters earlier in their careers, each carried only about on -third of them while losing their Senate seats to Republican challengers. In southern states, where many non-college whites are also evangelical Christians, the numbers were even more lopsided: Ron DeSantis carried almost two thirds of them against African-American Democrat Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor's race; Ted Cruz carried nearly three fourths of them in his Texas Senate race against Beto O'Rourke; and Brian Kemp won over four fifths of them against African-American Democrat Stacey Abrams in their Georgia governor's contest.\n\nDemocrats, by contrast, carried 53% of whites with a college education in the national House exit polls. Again, it's difficult to precisely compare that with earlier results because of the changes in the poll's methodology. But on Tuesday Democrats won these voters in 13 Senate races and tied in another (North Dakota). Democrats won about three fifths or more of college-educated white women in Senate races from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, to Nevada, Florida and Montana. White-collar whites also helped Democrats win governorships in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Nevada.\n\nThe persistence of these demographic trends through all corners of the country largely explains the lopsided geography in results for the House of Representatives. Republicans suffered very few dents in their dominance of small town and rural House seats last week. Democrats won only three districts whose rural population ranks in the top 20% of the House, while losing two of their own in those ranks, according to tabulations by CNN producer Aaron Kessler.\n\nBut the palpable recoil from Trump among white-collar voters in all regions explains why the GOP losses in suburban House seats extended so widely. It was perhaps not a surprise that Democrats ousted many of the last House Republicans who had survived for years in suburbs of otherwise blue-trending metro areas, such as Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. But the breadth of the movement toward Democrats among well-educated white voters explains why the GOP also lost suburban House seats last week in Atlanta, Charleston, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City, Des Moines, Oklahoma City, Orange County (CA), and possibly Salt Lake City, all places that had earlier resisted the white collar Democratic tide. Of the 33 Republican-held seats that CNN has called for the Democrats, 26 (or nearly four-fifths) are in districts where the share of college graduates exceeds the national average, according to Kessler's calculations.\n\nThese are the new swing states\n\nThe result is a politics that is converging across different regions. Political analysts, with justification, are accustomed to thinking of Pennsylvania as a quintessential swing state and Texas as the foundation of the Republican coalition. But the results in both places on Tuesday shared many similarities. In both states, Republicans continued to run very well in small towns and rural places (though Democrat Bob Casey in Pennsylvania regained ground in such mid-sized blue-collar communities as Erie and Scranton). And just like Casey, Beto O'Rourke ran up the score in diverse and younger urban places (he won each of the counties including Austin, Dallas and Houston by 200,000 votes or more and amassed a 100,000-plus margin in San Antonio), and made marked gains in previously red-leaning suburban areas around those metropolitan centers, from Collin and Denton counties near Dallas to Williamson and Hayes outside of Austin. Until now, Republicans had dominated both the urban and rural parts of Texas since the mid-1990s. In terms of its political alignment -- a suddenly competitive contest between growing Democratic strength in metro areas and undiminished Republican dominance beyond them -- 2018 may be the year that Texas rejoined the union.\n\nYet for all the consistency of these geographic and demographic trends, the results in the 2020 presidential race may be shaped most by each party's ability to defy them -- or at least to bend them at the margins. In the Rust Belt states that tipped the 2016 election to Trump -- especially Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- Democrats won both Senate and governor's races last week by restoring an old advantage that Trump had largely erased: In all three states, the Democratic nominees ran slightly better among whites without a college degree than their party did almost anywhere else. They'll need to continue that revival to recapture the states in two years from Trump, who may present a more formidable challenge in them than the Republicans on last week's ballot.\n\nConversely, despite the Democratic gains in Southern suburbs, Republicans continued to run better among college-educated white voters in Florida, Texas and Georgia than they did in most places. (Although exit polls weren't available in North Carolina, the voting results there point to a similar conclusion.) To hold those states in 2020, Trump will need to prevent any further erosion, even as white-collar voters elsewhere appear to be hardening in their hostility to him.\n\nEven in a politics increasingly homogenized by the same national trends, these small regional variations could provide the tipping point for the epic confrontation approaching in 2020.",

    "text": "(CNN) White supremacists are saying they were winners in last week's midterm elections.\n\nThey were already emboldened by the language used by President Donald Trump and senior members of his administration -- words like \"nationalist\" and \"invasion\" that have hateful dual meanings -- according to a review of sites frequented by white supremacists. And they saw Tuesday's results as a victory for white America with what they believe will be progress toward a border wall, an end to DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, and birthright citizenship.\n\nMemes and commentary on the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer site bashed nonwhite candidates who did not win, as well as losses by Republicans not seen as Trump loyalists.\n\n\"This changed history. It cleared away any of the remaining fog of confusion about what exactly we are dealing with in this country,\" Daily Stormer founder and publisher Andrew Anglin wrote. \"This is a race war. Period.\"\n\nWhat is not clear is if any extremists will follow words with violence, as allegedly happened with Robert Bowers, who has pleaded not guilty to killing 11 people at a synagogue late last month , allegedly because he believed Jews were helping \"invaders.\"\n\nThe victory of Rep. Steve King, pictured, was especially significant to white nationalists like Andrew Anglin.\n\nAnglin was buoyed by the win of Rep. Steve King in Iowa , even after King was pilloried for meeting with a far-right Austrian group linked to Nazis and retweeting an avowed Nazi sympathizer. King, a Republican, says he was unaware of the Nazi links in both those instances, but he has used racially charged and anti-immigrant rhetoric for years.\n\nKing still won with 50.6% of the vote in Iowa's deeply conservative 4th Congressional District. In Illinois, Arthur Jones, a self-declared Holocaust denier and former leader of the American Nazi Party tallied almost 56,000 votes, more than a quarter of the total, standing for the GOP in Illinois' 3rd Congressional District.\n\n\"Steve King won,\" Anglin wrote. \"If last night was a referendum on Steve King's white nationalism, as the Democrats were trying to frame it, then white nationalism won.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail for Sen. Ted Cruz fighting for re-election in Texas, Trump declared, \"I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist.\"\n\nHe told the crowd, \"We're not supposed to use that word,\" perhaps because he knew of its overtones of cultural superiority to others.\n\nTrump batted away a question about whether his words emboldend white nationalists, saying the question itself was racist.\n\nBut he would not clarify when asked about it the day after the election by Yamiche Alcindor of \"PBS Newshour,\" who said of his words, \"Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.\" Trump brushed her off with \"That's such a racist question.\"\n\nWhen she followed up with, \"There are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric,\" he replied: \"Oh, I don't believe that. I don't believe that.\"\n\nBut others apparently do believe it.\n\nA commenter on the 4chan bulletin board joked Trump was winking at them.\n\nEarlier, another poster declared Trump was venerated by white supremacists: \"What Dems, all leftists and pundits do not understand is that TRUMP is patriots' and Western/American Heritage's CHAMPION.\"\n\nTo Alcindor, Trump repeated two more times how racist the question was. But he also never flatly denounced white supremacists. They were overjoyed, calling the press conference \"glorious,\" and \"beautiful\" on 4chan, with one commenter writing: \"I am honestly in awe of this man as a leader.\"\n\nKeegan Hankes reviews propaganda from the far right for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"It doesn't take an overt slur for these individuals to basically become emboldened and to recognize and be excited by policies that they see would further their goals,\" said Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project.\n\n\"When they hear the President say things like, 'I'm not a racist,' they turn around amongst themselves and say, 'He just has to say that for practical reasons,' 'he just has to say that basically to get himself cover, to do the things that we want him to do,'\" Hankes says.\n\nThat was also the reaction after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August last year where torch-carrying crowds marched through the streets saying: \"Jews will not replace us.\" A woman was killed when a car was driven into a group of counterprotesters.\n\n\"You had some very bad people in that group,\" Trump said in remarks about the Unite The Right rally. \"But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\n\n\"President Trump's response to Charlottesville absolutely legitimized these individuals,\" Hankes says.\n\nWhile some language is seen as a \"dog whistle\" -- a code heard with a special meaning by the like-minded -- at other times, harsh and false terminology from the White House takes over.\n\nTrump was combative with reporters the day after the elections, doubling down on his assertion that migrants in Mexico were would-be invaders.\n\nAt the Wednesday news conference, CNN's Jim Acosta challenged Trump on his description of the caravan of Central American migrants heading through Mexico toward the United States as an \"invasion\" when it was not.\n\nBut Trump batted away the challenge. \"I consider it an invasion,\" Trump told Acosta.\n\nOn places like 4chan, false talk of the migrant caravan as \"invaders\" has taken over on some of the message boards and become a popular meme topic. Analysts say \"the browning of America\" where whites become a minority is what the white supremacists fear most.\n\nThere are threads with memes containing photos doctored to look like people breaking down walls at the US border with Mexico. There are jokes about how the traditional rush of Black Friday shoppers is nothing compared to what would happen next. In another thread on 4chan, commentators speculate about how many people would be shot as they come over the border. The thread appeared to reference Trump's comment that US troops on the border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones. \"All of them,\" one poster wrote of a possible casualty count. \"Not enough,\" said another.\n\nThe Daily Stormer publisher exhorted his readers to go to the polls with this post featuring President Trump.\n\nBefore the midterm election, the Daily Stormer site urged followers to vote for their overt and implicit agendas. It featured a flashing image of Donald Trump front and center with the words \"it's happening.\" There was also a vile meme on the site, which is visited more than 2.5 million times a month, according to data from analytics firm SimilarWeb. A commenter posted a picture of white men dressed for war with the words \"us if we win\" followed by \"them if we win\" on a photo of Jews being led to slaughter at gas chambers during the Holocaust.\n\nThe administration's approach to immigration in particular has \"electrified\" many racists, Hankes said, \"to the point where they're begging their followers to go out and find ways to put Republicans in office.\"\n\n\"They believe it will be easier for these policies to sail through,\" he said. \"And these are things that they think are essential for creating a white ethno-state.\"\n\nPerhaps this election did energize white nationalists to vote, if they thought they had a champion in government. But there is also the fear -- and the example -- of men taking matters into their own violent hands.\n\nBowers, the accused synagogue killer, echoed Trump talking points when he wrote on the free-speech forum Gab that \"I have noticed a change in people saying 'illegals' that now say 'invaders'.\" The post, made six days before the shooting, continued, \"I like this.\"",
